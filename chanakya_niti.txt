I am Vishnugupta Chanakya.
Acharya is the one that guides the students by his own actions.
It is said that we learn from experiences.
But it is not necessary that they must be ours.
Since if we were to learn everything as we experience it
then a lifespan will fall too short.
Hence we have legacies and history.
History of those ancestors
whose experiences teach us.
I will teach you the most bitter lessons
that I have learned from my experiences.
But why am I teaching you?
Because the nation always needs people like Chandragupta
who can keep the nation united and mighty.
Ones that act towards the glory of nation.
I want every child of Bharat to be like Chandragupta Maurya.
One that has courage and wisdom.
One who has brain and brown.
And who is a great blade of wisdom and might.
So that every threat to the nation is countered.
So be ready to take lessons
and to pave your own path.
My lessons and your actions.

Always speak the truth.
Always lead a simple life.
You must've been hearing
about this since childhood.
But.. I'd like to add
that besides leading a simple life
you should also be careful.
The trees that are
firm and stand upright
fall first when there's
a storm or are attacked by humans
but the ones who know
how to bow down in such cases
survive the catastrophe.
It is correct to stick
to the path of righteousness.
But to protect yourself
you must be able to
change yourself with time.
You should learn to be more careful.
A little bit of salt in butter
doesn't spoil the butter.
In fact it prevents the butter
from getting spoiled from going bad.
Similarly a truthful and simple person
must act carefully
and wisely.
Imbibe this quality and
your fate will change on its own.
The advice is mine
but the fate will be yours.

In order to grow a tree,
we choose the finest of seeds.
Since it is the seed that ensures
the tree will be a great banyan
or a thorny shrub!
But the very existence of the tree
is ensured by the soil, the ground
where the seed shall sprout.
If the soil is barren,
the seed will wither
and if the soil is saline
the plant will end up a sapling.
So it relies on the soil
which seed shall rise
as a great banyan in future
and grant residence to
many and shade to countless.
And such is the bond
amidst a King and his people.
If the King is the seed,
the people are the soil.
If you wish for a great
rule from a great ruler
then the people must be on guard.
They just keep working.
Since the King is amongst them.
So we do not need to have
expectations from the ruler
but we need to test our abilities.
A lesson from me. An action from you.

Dormant fear helps
protect our lives.
But if it overwhelms us
it may put our lives in danger.
Snake is the most dangerous
animal in this world.
But you must also know
that it is the most timid animal.
It stays hidden and
lurks in the bushes.
It never exposes itself.
What is amazing is the fact
that not all species
of it are poisonous.
Not everyone gets bitten by it.
Despite that,
everybody is afraid of it.
Why so?
That is because it hisses.
That's how,
it takes advantage of the fear
it creates in the
minds of its predators.
This is how it keeps itself safe.
Being scared is not a bad thing.
But never let your enemy know
that you are afraid
because not every battle
is fought physically.
Some of them can be won by faking it.
That is my advice to you.
It is up to you to follow it or not.

You might have established
many goals in your life.
But the question is..
How many goals did
you fail to achieve?
On failing
you must think
that you worked hard
and did not let your resolve break
then why you still failed.
To know the answer to this question
ask a question to yourself.
Who all knew about the plan
that you had considered your goal?
When a papaya tree fruits
it is covered with a cloth.
It is done
to prevent birds and
insects to be attracted
towards it due to its
colouration and smell.
So, if you want to enjoy the fruit
you will have to hide it.
Only being a hard worker
is not sufficient to succeed.
If you want to achieve your goal
you will have to keep your plan
to achieve the goal a secret.
A secretive plan
ensures victory.
It is my ethics
and your destiny.

If you hold a gem with you
it adds to your identity
and if the next person has it
it's light blinds you.
If you have it
you can add it to your
crown and exalt your prosperity.
And if it is with your enemy
then it can trouble you direly!
The wise folk are like diamonds.
If you have them with
you then they are a great tool
and if they stand by the enemy
then they are a terrible weapon.
So you must rally the
best to your side at once
and never let them go.
My lessons and your actions.

In life, you cannot always achieve your
goal with sweet behaviour and ease.
If you have to affix
something to a wall
you need a nail.
Only hard work and simple nature cannot
make you successful for a long time.
For that, you need to bring tenacity,
strictness
and sharpness in your decisions.
Just like this nail.
It is flat at the top end
and sharp at the bottom end.
While advising someone
be simple.
But while putting that into
action be sharp and tenacious!
It is my ethics and your destiny.

What will you do if you find a snake?
You will either maintain
distance from it
or kill it.
You will never keep it with you.
That is the case with
evil people as well.
An evil person will create
only troubles for you.
He will either scare
you or finish you.
Both these consequences are not good.
After finding out about an evil person
there is only one
way to deal with him.
Finish him.
If you ever have to trust
between an evil man and a snake
always choose the snake.
Because a snake bites
only when its life is in danger.
But an evil person
will always try to harm you
for his interest.

If you go to someplace as a guest,
you like it.
You are respected,
honoured and greeted well.
And then gradually you begin comparing
it with your own house as it is
and you see your own house as lowly.
A country that has
no respect or wisdom..
A country that does not
have many opportunities for life
is abandoned by many.
But if your own house
is not pretty to look at
you do not abandon it.
You decorate the house,
you enhance its beauty.
If your nation does
not bring you respect
and does not have many
means for a livelihood
then you are to be blamed as well.
And in this case, you must
not think of your nation as weak
as compared to distant lands.
Spread wisdom around.
Bring in more means for
people to earn their keep.
Respect everyone and be respected.
Since no matter how pretty
someone else's house may seem
you can only sleep
well on your own bed.
A lesson from me
and an action from you.

A spear is used to bring
an elephant under control.
And a leash is used
to control a horse.
But if a leash is
used to ride an elephant
the rider may fall.
And if a horse is attacked
with a spear to control it
the horse may get injured.
Just like the way there
is a different ritual
to please different gods
there is also need to use different
weapons to control different animals.
Different people should be dealt with
acording to their behaviour and needs.
Some understand when explained
some join hands out of greed
some return to the right
track after being punished
and some need to be shattered
to make them submit.
Remember,
Lord Narayan's praises are not sung
in Lord Shiva's temple.
The rituals depend on
the God you are praying to.

Be it the war of
the kingdom or of life
the balance between
the sword and the armour
is very important.
The sword makes noise
when it leaves the sheath.
But the armour..
The armour remains quiet.
The sword moves forward
and attacks the enemy.
But the armour steps
back and protects us.
The sword sheds blood of
the enemy in the battlefield.
On the other hand,
in the same battlefield
the armour saves our
blood from being shed.
People who step into the
battlefield only with the sword
will either lose the
battle or their lives.
Do not have only smart and
intelligent people in your army.
Appoint some firm
and quiet people too.
When both of them are in your army
that is when you will win.
The teachings are mine.
The destiny is yours.

Only one leadership is great.
Look at your body.
Two eyes, two hands, 32 teeth
20 fingers and many organs.
But there is only one brain.
And all the parts of the body
function properly and carefully
on the leadership of this brain.
But if there is more than one brain
the body either acts
strange or falls sick.
So, just like the eyes,
nose, hands, ears and legs
keep many people who will advise you.
But if only person has the right
to become a leader and take decisions
the democracy remains strong
and you will attain success.
The teachings are mine

Have you ever wondered
why a diamond is placed in a crown?
Why do we wear it as jewellery?
Why do we not throw it on the road?
After all, it is a stone, is it not?
Do we value it only
because it is beautiful?
Even the leaves are beautiful.
Then why do we find
them lying on the road?
Why do we crush them beneath our feet?
It is because of diamond's hardness.
Even if we even try to
crush the diamond under our feet
it will hurt us so bad
that we will never forget the wound.
That is why we value it so much.
Same goes for a talented person.
If you value him,
he will make you proud
but if you humiliate him,
he will wound you.
Hence, we should never
insult a talented person.
My ethics, your destiny.

People travel together to remain safe.
It is good.
Travelling in numbers
keeps people safe.
But this very group
takes away your identity.
Since you walk the
path led by someone else.
One has to walk alone
to pave one's own path.
Stars often exists in numbers
but it is the Sun that is worshipped.
Since the sun walks alone.
One must endure, rise
and tackle odds.
And only then one can
forge an identity for oneself
and only then one is respected.
A lesson from me

What is the difference
between a master and a slave?
Both are humans.
While a slave tries
to protect his master
he in turn protects his slaves.
Both of them discharge
their respective duty.
What is the reason
that the master
gets the right to wear the crown
and his slaves are
offered to sit by his feet?
A purblind leads a normal life
but a visionary
is remembered even after his death.
It all boils down to perspective.
A person with a great vision
and foresight
ascends the throne.
So, one must think of consequences
before taking any call.
It depends on your perception
if you will get glorified
or be humiliated.
The principles are mine

It is true that friends
fill happiness in our life.
But the same closeness with them
can make you careless.
Friends appreciate
the good things in you
and increase your self-confidence.
This makes you go further
away from the truth.
Whereas, the enemy will
highlight the bad things in you
and compel you to work on yourself.
He will keep you alert.
That will make
you more conscious about
the conspiracies against you.
Friendship is life
but to make sure that life is safe
keep your enemies
closer than your friends.

[Sanskrit shlok]
[Sanskrit shlok]
The lion is the king of the jungle.
But just because it
is a king it does not imply
that it has the luxury to rest
while the deer walks up
to the lion to sacrifice itself.
In order to display authority
the lion must roar!
In order to sustain its powers
the lion must work
hard and hunt its prey.
The key is to work hard.
Only with efforts
does a man become king.
Hence, never look away from hard-work
because if you do that
it will take moments to
become a servant from a king.
These are my principles.
Make the right choice.

To achieve one's purpose
one's soul needs the body.
If the mortal form is destroyed
one's existence in
the society is gone.
Hence it is the duty of every being
to protect its body and
make it stronger by being healthy.
A healthy body keeps
your mind healthy too.
And only a healthy mind can help you
achieve physical and spiritual goals.
Respect your body.
Only then will it come to use to you.
These are my principles.
Make the right choice.

If drops of water fall on a hot stove
they evaporate
but if they
falls on lotus
they shine like a pearl in light.
If they fall on a corpse's mouth
it helps attain salvation
to the departed soul.
But if they fall on a snake's mouth
they turn into poison.
The composition of
water is same throughout.
It is only the circumstances
that change.
Surroundings can change
the nature of water
much like humans do.
So, you are advised
to choose the right company
because if you choose a wrong one
either you will face the consequences
or turn into an evil person.
The company we keep
determines our destiny.
The principles are mine.
The choice is yours.

The past and future
are like reflections in the mirror.
It appears that you can grab it
but it is always out of your reach.
It deceives us like a reflection does.
While recollecting the
disappointment of the past
or while hoping to have success
in the future which is yet to come
a person fails to
focus on the present.
The present which, if not lived fully
can lead to a disappointing past.
And if the present moment is wasted
it is inevitable for
the future to be destroyed.
Hence, work on your present.
Forget the past.
Stop worrying about the future.
Because if you worry about
the troubles of the future
the future is bound
to have those troubles.
These are my principles.
Make the right choice.

By adding drops of lemon to the milk
the milk becomes sour.
But in that same
milk if we add jaggery
the milk does not become sour.
The same way
before giving a space to a person
in our lives or before
getting acquainted
we should very well know his behaviour
his motive and nature.
That's because you are not
water which can mix everything.
So stay alert
because ignorance
will make you pay a price
the way milk suffers
when added with juices of lemon.
I depart the words of wisdom..
And the outcome is in your hands.

Do you see this pearl?
The oyster that houses it..
It was once a living being.
But it made a mistake
and it was to allow
a small particle of sand within.
And after entering within
that sand particle
drew upon the juices
within the oyster
and in time, gradually
that oyster died
and came forth a pearl.
Just as that particle of sand
an enemy may be weak or frail
but if given a chance,
it can be deadly!
So always keep an eye on your enemies
and do not let them venture too close
or else you will lose your existence.
A lesson from me

It is a Rudraksha. It is considered
the tears of Lord Mahadev.
If there are tears in your eyes,
wipe the tears on your own.
Because if you let
someone to wipe your tears
he will use you.
First, he will show you sympathy.
And he will take a
lot from you in return.
That is why, do not express
your weakness by shedding tears.
Do not let anyone learn about this.
Improve yourself in private.
And transform your weakness
into your strength.
Like Lord Mahadev's Rudraksha
transform your tears
into something useful.
Remember this.
If you show your weakness to others
it will mark the first
step of your failure.
Follow my principles

The sweet water of many
rivers merges into the ocean.
Yet the water of
the ocean tastes salty.
Because that is the
nature of the ocean.
Similarly, no matter how well
you behave with a cunning person
expecting him to go against
his instinctive nature
to do something nice, is futile.
And hence
one must make attempts on people
whom one can expect from, to deliver.
These are my principles.

Most of the birds and
animals that live in the jungle
hunt for their survival.
They succeed sometimes.
They fail sometimes.
But there is one attacker
whose attack never goes in vain.
A hawk!
And a hawk always succeeds
because it has a plan behind
every attack.
It does not attack the
prey the moment it spots it.
It just observes the prey.
It roams around its
prey for hours and days
from a great height so much so
that the prey does not even
realise that it's being watched.
And when the right time arrives
just one attack
and the prey dies.
So, if you want to succeed in life
make a plan bravely
and when the right time arrives
attack the target
with all your strength.
The teachings are mine
and the destiny is yours.

If I were to tell you
that you must put this
flame out using this dagger

then will it be possible for you?
Never.
Since water puts fire out

In the same manner
it is not enough to gather
might and resources in life.
One must use them
wisely at the right time

To check the authenticity
of gold it is rubbed on a stone
then boiled in heat
then struck by hammers
after which is it purified by water.
Whatever can pass
such tests is pure gold
and whatever does not, is copper.
Similarly in order to test
whether a person is good or evil
there are a few criteria
which one needs to keep in mind.
A good person can experience anger
but unlike an evil person
he will display his
anger against injustice.
Before someone who is superior
even an evil person surrenders.
But a truly kind person is one
who treats the ones who
are beneath him, with respect.
And hence, if you wish to have
gold or the company of good people
you must decide after
keeping these criteria in mind.
These are my principles.

Can you see this bow?
The string is an important part of it
because the targeted arrow is
sent to the destination by the string.
But for the arrow to reach its target
the string has to go back.
Similarly,
the people who work below us in life
can help us to reach our destination
only when we step back
and give them a chance to come forward
and let them showcase their talent.
But
along with the pull
the string needs to be tied too.
Otherwise,
the arrow does not gain the speed.
Give freedom to the people
whom you want to work.
But it is also necessary
to be strict with them.
You will not be able to reach the
target if you give too much freedom.

Without breaking the tough

its sweet water cannot be consumed.
But if we throw the
coconut hard on the ground.
The coconut will surely break
but it's sweet water will be wasted.
That's why if we want to
enjoy the sweet water of the coconut
we must target
at one point and constantly hit it.
Only then can we get to enjoy
the sweet water of the coconut.
Just like this, even in our lives
to attain success
only hard work isn't enough.
If we need to succeed,
we need to set the target

If we cannot see our
face in the mirror clearly
then we try to clean the mirror
and the reflection
becomes clear again.
What if we are unable
to see the reflection clearly
even after cleaning the mirror?
Have you ever thought
why this happens?
Because many times,
the dirt is not on the mirror
but it clouds our eyes.
In the same way
if we are unable to find our aim
then it is not necessary
that the path or the aim is faulty.
Your vision and the way of thinking
can also be faulty.

Venom is a great product.
If it is introduced in

it can be fatal and kill.
But the antivenin made from the venom
serves as elixir in
saving thousands of lives.
It means that goodness or
evil does not dwell in an object.
It is in the intent
of the person using it.

run away from the problem
get disappointed and accept defeat.

Gold does not lose its value
even if it is on the ground.
Why?
Because its value
is not defined based
on its exterior form.
It is based on the nature of the metal
which it is made up from.
Similarly, not a person's conditions
but his nature is his real treasure.
So, learn to identify gold.
Otherwise, you may look away from it
since it is lying on the soil
and somebody else may get hold of it
and its power may become his treasure.

Sometimes it is woven
into a robe for somebody.
Sometimes it becomes
the tail of an arrow
and makes the arrow reach its mark.
Sometimes it shields you
from the biting cold in the winter.
That is because the cotton
accepts all challenges.
The same way in life
a person who accepts challenges
in all the adverse
conditions which comes to him
he definitely reaches
the heights of success
he also makes others benefit

Do you see these gold coins?
If I keep collecting them
and put one on top of the other
they will stay stable for a time
but after a while
they will not be able
to support their own weight
and crash.
The same way
when greed gets out of control
it makes a person's base unstable.
It births imbalance.
Be it the greed of money,
happiness and comfort

There is nothing bad in being a thorn.
But before we hurt someone,
we should know
whom we are hurting.
Such situations may
arise before humans too.
We can be enemies with anyone
but before attacking them,
make sure you gauge
how powerful he is than us.
Because, if the enemy
turns out to be more powerful
you will be destroyed.
Hence, until you do not
find the weakness of the enemy
it is better to let
him be your friend.

The sandalwood tree
is known in the world
for its light fragrance.
But the world often forgets
that the same sandalwood
tree plays host
to the most poisonous
snakes in the world.
Similarly, the one who speaks sweetly
can also harbour enmity towards you.
'Too much politeness is
the sign of a cunning person.'
The one who talks more
politely than necessary
can turn out to be
detrimental for you.
So, be it the sandalwood tree
or the people you meet in your life
give them a place in your
life after a thorough analysis.
You will be safe.

No matter how dangerous weapons are
if they are not sharpened at times
they lose their edge.
Human brain and body
are like a sword.
If your brain is not confronted
with problems on times
it becomes less active.
Just like that,
if the body forgets struggle
or practice of facing tough situations
it starts to become weak.
So if you get tough
situations in your life
do not turn away from them.
Face them.
If you turn away,
you turn away from your security

The birds that are restrained
in a cage since their birth
cannot fly away from an open cage
even after they grow up.
They keep wandering around the cage.
The same thing happens
with domesticated animals.
Have you ever thought
about why it happens?
Why do they not escape
even after cutting
their bonds loose?
Why do they not fly away?
They stay near us.
Because the most dangerous dependency
or slavery is psychological.
If someone becomes
a slave psychologically
then even after the bonds are severed
that person does not
try to live independently.
So, be it a person or a thought..
Be it a thing of leisure or a place..
Do not become dependent
on them so much

But..
We get one more thing
to learn from this saying.
This is true
that an elephants outer
tusk cannot help him eat
but their huge size
and strong image
strike fear in the enemy.

Woodpecker attacks the branch
using its beak continuously.
Elephant rubs its body on the tree
using its complete strength.
And the bear attacks it to get honey.
But any of their attacks
cannot make the tree fall.
While a small termite destroys
a tree right from its root.
Have you ever thought
that how a small termite
becomes successful
in finishing the
existence of a huge tree?
Because the termite does
not attack the tree from the outside
but it attacks from the inside.
That is why always stay safe

In the game of chess
the king is the most important.
But despite being so important
he proceeds only one
step forward in one move
when compared to the other coins.
Have you ever wondered why is it so?
Because all the other coins
work hard to protect the king.
In real life too
this is the relationship
between a king and his army.
That is why a king should
always choose such people in his army
who will be always ready to sacrifice
their lives for their

If the enemy is attacked
fiercely and strongly
he will be warned

he is trapped in a simple manner
he will surely be trapped.
You must be patient.

Nature is but full of colours.
But when you look deeply
colours are a mixture
of two factors.
Let's take white for example.
When you add any colour to white
it blends with that colour
and results in a new shade.
Like this. On the other hand..
If you add any colour to black
it blots out the
existence of that colour.
This is the difference
between a good king and a tyrant.
A good king mingles with
his subjects like the colour white
and creates a new, bright future.
Whereas,
a tyrant, just like the colour black
of his subjects and kingdom
exploits all resources and wealth
and destroys their very existence

It is the fate of river
to merge in the sea.
And to reach this fate
the river overcomes
ever obstacle it faces
and it keeps moving ahead.
And finally
it meets the sea.

it simply as your mark

your destiny and go for it.
Only then you can
hold the unwavering focus
to reach your goal.
One that a river has to meet the sea.
And thus it can cross
any hurdle it in's path

Just how this pipe increases
the fire of this oven
praise is a medium
in the life of human beings
which increases our confidence.
But if it is not used within a limit
and without proper knowledge
the same pipe will increase
the fire to an extent
that it will burn
everything into ashes.
Similarly, in life too
limitless praise blinds us
and we stop seeing the reality.
So, beware of those who praise you
because every time
their intention may not be
to increase your confidence
but to destroy your identity.

In our nation,
many Goddesses are venerated.
They are revered.
But in our very nation
in most places
women do not get that same respect.
And that is
because of the age old mentality
that women are weak
and men are better.
But, the women are mothers
the reason behind the existence of men
how can they be weak?
That is why it is necessary
to change the mentality
that thinks of women as weak.
Only then the betterment of family,

If I lose my control

An attack on enemy's

She nestles herself
and lays eggs
in other bird's nest
by throwing off the eggs.
Oblivious of the fact
what the cuckoo did
the other bird considers
the eggs in the nest to be hers,
she nestles them.
This way,
not only the cuckoo
protects her eggs
she also protects the nest.
This rule can also be
strategized in a battle.
If you fear insecure
then retreat in the dwelling
of your enemy.
This way, you will escape
the attack of the enemy

when the time is right
take up position
and conquer the enemy.

what will be your reaction?
Even that is very important.
That is because suffering
from the mistake of others
if you get angry on them
then you will not be helping
that person
in making him learn
from his mistake.
The outcome will be
when that person
again commits mistakes
in the future
then he will tend to hide
his actions.
So remember
if you are harmed
by the mistake of others
then do not take
the path of anger or aggression.
Calmly try to
solve the situation
or else, the mistake
which happened unintentionally
might also make you suffer for
being betrayed in the future.

If I mix some red colour with yellow
it will result in a beautiful
colour called orange.
But
if I keep on adding red colour
to yellow colour..
Gradually, but surely the
yellow colour will disappear.
This holds good even
for our tradition and culture.
Welcoming a foreign culture
and making it part of our lives
isn't a bad thing at all.
But letting the foreign culture
supersede our own
is just unacceptable.
The way in which two colours
give rise to a new colour
two cultures can
co-exist with each other
and give birth to a better culture.
But there's one important thing.
When one culture tries
to replace the other
both will be extinct.

It becomes a wound.
And that wound becomes sore

In the same way, in our life
small differences in

That is why, small misunderstandings

should be resolved immediately.
Solve those.

Try harder. Put more efforts.
Pull. Pull more strongly.
Winning and losing
are an indispensible part of any game.
When one participates in a game
one will win and the other will lose.
But whether you win or lose
you have to always respect
the opposite player.
The same policy of the game
applies even at war field.
Because, the respect you
offer to your enemy to your opponent
will describe your character.
Remember, whether it is a playground

a true winner is the one

When a bird learns to fly
it leaves its nest
even though that nest
is the safest place for it
which can give it
pleasure and happiness.
Similarly,
when a student acquires knowledge
he gives up the
seminary of his master.
Even though his fellow
students and friends are there
and he can rest peacefully there
away from the chaos of life,

For the development of existence
giving up all comfort and safety

But if for some reason it
does not produce flowers
or if the flowers are deformed
will you blame the plant

Or will you first inspect the ground
in which the plant took root?
To see if the problem
is with the ground.
To see if there is termite
or other insects present,
which are harming the plant.
To see if it lacks water or light.
That is why,

your speed will still become slow.
A true leader is the one

One is so sharp that it can destroy

The other one is rusty.
The reason?
This sword was sharpened
from time to time.
It was kept sheathed when not needed.
But this one..
No one cared for its maintenance.
The same way
loyalty and faithfulness
are also like a sword.
If you are good to someone
you will have their
loyalty for lifetime
which can save you from any danger.
But if you ruin your relation
with someone through misconduct

starts taking that relation

and positive in doing business
the outcome will also
be clear and fruitful.
But on the other hand
if we cheat or dupe someone
in business then, we might
have to suffer for those actions.
Remember..
The way you treat others
the same will come onto you.
My ethics..
Your actions.

Can you see these two coins?
They look the same.
But this coin is made up of gold
and this coin, is made of copper.
It is just gold-plated.
Anybody can get fooled for a
moment by looking at this copper coin
until it is tested in a furnace
because after that its truth
will be out in front of everyone.
Similarly, you can fool
the world for a short while
through your external behaviour
because when time tests you
your reality will be exposed.
So, remember this.
The coin of deceit will
not work for a long time.

People make many
relationships in their lives.
But it is important for us to know
which relationship will benefit us
and which will harm us.
For an example
no matter how much milk
you feed a poisonous snake
you will not be able
to change its nature.
It will always remain
a poisonous creature.
Similarly your friendship with
a shrewd person
can lead to your fall.
Remember one thing.
Give your time and
respect to that person
who deserves it.

Your destiny.

Defeat and victory is a part of life.
But if you really want
to test your calibre
always compete with
a person better than you.
Even if you lose against that person
you will learn quite a few things.
And if you defeat that person
then you will reach
new heights of success.
If you want to reach
new heights of success
always compete with a better person.
Only then you will attain perfection.

Your destiny.

Raindrops when they
drop on earth from the sky.
They mix up with the soil
and spreads the fragrance everywhere.
But
when these rain drops come together
because of heavy rain..
Then it can bring flood as well.
Similarly in life
if we don't value a person's nobility
and generosity.
Then that person can get a change
in our life like those rain drops.
The same person can
be the cause of our trouble.

Have you seen a
fisherman gather his net
after he has caught the fishes?
Even if the fisherman
sees a bigger fish at that time
he does not throw
his net back in the water
since he knows that
if he goes for the bigger fish
he might lose the ones
that he has already caught.
And finally he will have an empty net.
And hence in life, if we seek the
uncertain while leaving what we have
then we will lose what is not ours
and we might also
lose what we have earned
by hard work and efforts.
Always remember.
It is foolish to drop
the silver you got today
for the gold that
you might get tomorrow.

Leaves of Neem tree
have many qualities.
Everyone knows how useful
they are for body and health.
But despite being so useful
the leaves of Neem tree
also have one deficiency..
They are bitter.
And because of this
we hesitate to eat them.
But if we were to eat these
Neem leaves with honey
we can very easily take
advantage of their qualities.
Like these Neem leaves
only having qualities and
talent is not enough for a person.
It is also important
for them to be polite
and behave decently.
Only then will this world appreciate
their qualities and talent.

Your destiny.
