'The year 323 BC.'
'India.'
'The Battle of Jhelum
came to an end.'
'And so did two great warriors
of the world'
'Puru and Alexander.'
'But people did not stop trying
to conquer the nation.'
'India would still experience
foreign intruders.'
'Alexander's commander-in-chief
Seleucus returned'
'with the same intention
Alexander had.'
'But now, there was only
one hope to save India.'
'Magadha, which was ruled
by Dhananand, from Nand clan.'
'And Dhananand
would begin his day'
'a little differently.'
You must be wondering
why I start my day this way.
So that I do not forget
my roots and history.
Always remember
that I am a barber.
Am I right?
- Yes, my King.
No.. No!
I do this every day
so that I am reminded
that people bow down
before barbers.
That nobody is above us.
Am I right?
Yes, my King.
I have big news.
Puru is dead.
His chapter
has come to an end.
Do you know why hair
grows back?
Because the roots
are within the skin.
When you pull out
someone's hair
their hair never grows back.
A human is like hair
and his thoughts
are like the skin.
Only Puru has died,
not his dream of a united India
and that deceiving Brahmin
is coming to Magadha
with that very dream.
"The epitome of intelligence,
conscience and wisdom"
"with unmatched sense
of reasoning and judgement."
"One filled with
intellect and wisdom."
"The master of
devising war strategies."
"He is Chanakya.."
"He is Chanakya.."
I shall not allow him to enter
Magadha with that dream.
It is futile as the dream can
be passed on to someone else.
What do you Brahmins say?
Yes!
Scriptures keep
your thoughts alive.
Now you will see
how I will end this dream
of his with scriptures.
How much more money
should I give you?
I do not have a house
or any land left.
I have nothing left.
The rich are charged
20 per cent interest.
While we are charged
30 per cent!
Let us go inside.
My kids are hungry.
Until you arrange enough grains,
you are forbidden to enter.
Come on!
The King is charging
so much interest!
To grow his army.
But the people who are rich
are charged lesser interest
as compared to the poor.
The poor rebel, Bhairav
and not the rich.
That is why Dhananand
has burdened them
with such interests that they
are turning into rebels.
- I am hungry.
- Give us some food.
- Come on.
- Give us food.
- I am hungry.
- Give us some food.
This is strange. The subjects
are either too rich or completely poor.
The kingdom is the reflection
of the king's thoughts, Bhairav.
Since the king's objectives
have collapsed
how will the kingdom grow?
Pardon me, Acharya.
If you believe that Dhananand
is not a good king
then why do you want
to meet him?
For the future of India.
Alexander's commander-in-chief
Seleucus will surely attack after Alexander's demise.
And if he is not stopped
in the nick of time
he will start conquering
every region in India.
And only Dhananand,
King of Magadha
is capable enough
to stop Seleucus.
Despite his betrayal
in the past?
Give us food!
We are hungry.
Give us food!
We are famished!
I have no choice.
The safety of India depends
on its unity, Bhairav.
And in order to protect
this nation and see it united
even if I have
to give up my honour or life, I will.
We must try and seek help from Magadha with
the hope that they will protect India.
If Magadha
does not realise it
India will
become non-existent.
Dhananand
must understand it.
But why would an
arrogant king listen to you?
Arrogance
can never sustain
be it of a king like Dhananand
or the sun that provides energy
to the entire world.
Because when the sun is filled
with arrogance of his powers
and tries to burn everything
the moon or 'Chandra'
always stops
it with an eclipse.
"Chandragupta!"
"Chandragupta Maurya!"
"Chandragupta Maurya!"
"Chandragupta!"
Who was that?
Who hit me?
W-Who is here?
Oh, no!
What if it is a ghost?
Not ghost..
I am God!
I am here to change
your future.
God?
If You are God
then why do You
not come forward?
Really? Do you want proof now
that I exist?
Yes, Lord.
- Here you go.
Throw one coin in the air.
One coin?
- Yes, one coin.
Fine, Lord.
As You command.
Here is Your coin, Lord.
Where did it go?
Where did my coin go?
It is with me.
Hey, do not look up
or you will be doomed.
You imbecile!
You are destined to have
a lot of wealth.
Gold coins
chariots..
So tell me, Lord.
Tell me where I can find it.
You want wealth without
giving anything in return. Miser!
You must offer ten coins.
Ten coins?
Lord, what will You do
with coins?
If you want a better future,
give me ten coins.
Lord..
I request you
to manage with eight coins.
How dare you bargain
with me!
Here, I change your future.
Forgive me, Lord.
Please forgive me.
I seemed to have upset you.
Here.
This is Yours.
Now tell me where
the wealth is.
Close your eyes.
Hey, thief!
My coins..
Shubhada!
I am doomed!
I am done for.
What happened, Father?
- My coins!
My coins!
Hold on!
Catch!
You imbeciles!
Do not catch me catch them.
The thief
is the one who gets caught.
My coins!
You cannot even hold
a rope properly.
Who dropped me?
- It happened because of him.
He left the rope
when he saw a snake.
You fatso,
I will kick you so hard
that you will start flying.
Form a line.
Let us go!
You idiots, forget the pots!
Get the coins.
Show them what you
can do.
Come on, let us go.
You can only run
when you see a snake, is it?
Yes, now he is caught.
"Chandragupta!"
"Chandragupta!"
"He attacks his enemies."
"Chandragupta!"
"His sight
is as sharp as a blade."
"Chandragupta!"
"He is a warrior, but patient.
He is the pride of his clan."
"He is cultured and intelligent,
he is as bright as the sun."
"He is Chandragupta Maurya."
"He is Chandragupta Maurya."
"Chandragupta Maurya."
"Chandragupta Maurya."
"Chandragupta!"
Why are there so many Brahmins
in the palace, Acharya?
To welcome me.
Dhananand is aware
of my arrival.
Time is making you wiser,
Vishnugupta.
It is not necessary to give
you honour at every event.
It is the primary duty
of an Amatya
to fulfil the orders
of his king.
Amatya Rakshas
you should
be with your king.
What brings you here?
- I am here to warn you.
The path you have chosen
might perhaps lead you
to your doom.
Perhaps!
Had you explained the same
to your king in time
India would not have been
in trouble.
Perhaps then I would not
have to come here.
Vishnugupta.
Why do you want
to sacrifice yourself?
What will you gain from this?
What does the foundation
that goes far beneath the ground
and has no recognition,
gain?
In order to protect India
and make it united
I am ready to lay
the foundation.
You still have time.
Return.
It is inauspicious
if you come here.
Amatya Rakshas,
you came to warn me
and fulfilled your duty
as a Brahmin.
But now, I will fulfil
my duty as an Acharya
by entering the palace's court.
"Chanakya!"
"Chanakya!"
Chandragupta?
Guard, shut the gates!
Chandragupta!
Hey, get up.
Get up, fatso.
Come on, fatso!
What now?
- It is obvious.
As I said, I will kick you now.
Get up, fatso.
Come on.
Finally, I got you!
Everyone tries to control me
but nobody succeeds.
Oh! Acharya!
Splendid!
I never imagined
that you would visit us
at such an occasion.
I am here
to inform you
of some important things.
You must be aware..
You must have read
the Bhagavad Gita.
It is a great scripture
that says, 'Pure intentions
draw valid reasons'.
Look, I decided
to read the scriptures
and you showed up
as the reason.
This is such a surprising
coincidence.
What are you looking
at me for?
Do you not know
who he is?
Stand!
He is a well-renowned Acharya
from Takshashila.
His name is..
Pardon!
Pardon me, Acharya.
I forgot your name.
What is your name?
Vishnugupta Chanakya.
Oh, yes, Vishnugupta Chanakya!
He guides everyone.
He passes his knowledge of right
from wrong and auspicious from inauspicious.
Am I right, Chanakya?
He is no ordinary Brahmin
who begs to survive.
If you all are knowledgeable,
you might call him omniscient.
I made a grave mistake!
How can I be seated
before such a great Acharya?
Now tell me.
What brings you here?
Or did some thought
bring you here?
Yes, thoughts
and even news.
I am here to discuss
something important with you.
I am honoured.
Of course I will listen to you.
But since we are here
for the scripture reading
I want you to participate
and enlighten me.
I am highly grateful, Acharya.
And since you will be
the centre of attention now
and the inception of the idea
I would want you to be
seated right in the middle of the court
so that everyone
can watch you.
I assure you.
This is going to be very
interesting and entertaining.
I, Dhananand, promise you
that your thoughts
will not be intervened.
Laugh all you want.
You..
I wonder for how many days
I will be unable to sit.
Thieves! Thieves!
Thieves! Thieves!
My coins!
Catch them and save
my coins. Thieves!
That miser will not let us go.
Let us run.
Caught you.
Look there.
Look this one.
And say that we are the thieves.
We are the thieves.
Say once again.
We are the thieves.
We are the thieves.
- We are the thieves.
- Where is the thieves?
We are the thieves.
Beat him up!
Chandra, my magic worked.
Not yet.
We need to disappear
from here too.
Let us go.
Shubhada..
Wait! Catch them!
Begin the event!
The lock
you have insulted today..
I, Acharya Vishnugupta Chanakya
swear by that same lock
I shall uproot
you from this throne
and put a worthy ruler on it..

================================================================================

Episode: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXn5apdfGM8

Where did the rest go?
Why are you in a rush, kid?
Thieves..
Someone please catch them!
They have fled with my gold coins.
Finally, you got caught.
Mister, thank you so
much for saving my money
from getting stolen by these crooks.
Sir, please return my coins.
I will take your leave.
Hey, take your hands off me!
Who is she?
She is my daughter.
I am saving every
penny to get her married.
So, please return my money now.
- Come on!
- Leave me..
- Hey, this is wrong!
- Come on.
Were you not worried
about your daughter?
Now I have freed you from it.
Take him away!
Wrestler, let Suvidha go or else..
Or else, what?
Or else, you will remain
a wrestler just for the namesake.
You will require the aid
of two people to even use the loo.
Is it?
And who will bring
me to this condition?
Why don't you tell me?
Chandra.
Chandragupta!
Chandragupta!
- Chandragupta!
- Chandragupta!
- Chandragupta!
- Chandragupta!
"The attack on the enemies.
Chandragupta!"
"He is as sharp as a weapon.
Chandragupta!"
"He is brave and patient.
He is the base of a race."
"He is logical and intelligent.
He has the magnificence of the sun."
"He is Chandragupta Maurya!"
"He is Chandragupta Maurya."
"Chandragupta Maurya.."
"Chandragupta Maurya.."
"Chandragupta Maurya.. Chandragupta!"
I never imagined that the
size of the moon can be so puny.
You check the impact of a weapon
rather than its size, my friend.
The moon might be tiny
but it can put an eclipse on the sun
which is million times
larger than itself.
I have heard that where
there are vessels there is noise.
And when the scholars gather
at a place debates cannot be avoided
but I am amazed.
Everybody is silent here.
I think, the wise men of Magadh
are feeling helpless in front
of the scholar from Takshashila.
So, I request you, Chanakya
to enlighten the dimwits
of Magadh with your knowledge.
We all are in the royal court.
So, please throw light
on the definition of a king.
The word 'King' begins with 'Raj'
which means the granules of the soil.
That is why, the one who
rises from the soil is the king.
The one who is connected to this earth
is the king.
Just like the particles of
soil come together to become a mansion
in the same way the one who
is built by the people is a king.
That's why it is the
primary duty of a king
that he always stays
connected to his people.
- Because..
- The wise ones of Magadh.
In which direction of
Magadh is Takshashila located?
Towards the west..
That is why I am feeling like
the Sun has risen from the west today.
Chanakya has just showered
his counter thoughts in Magadh
located near the Ganga.
Chanakya..
Your thoughts and views,
both are inappropriate.
Magadh's assembly will
tell you the truth of a king.
Vallabh. What is a king?
A king is the God
figure in this world.
The king rules the state,
and the people belong to state.
There is no one more superior
than the king in this world.
The king is the foremost
and the most respectful person.
A king is like the water where
the state thrives like a plant.
Your Majesty,
you are the root of Magadh.
So, it is the duty of
the people to keep you happy.
Great.. Right..
Great.. Right..
Great.. Right..
Great.. Right..
Vallabh.
What shall we call the
one who thinks the opposite?
He must be some foolish
who lost his mind
or some clown who came to entertain.
If you all
could cross this
circle by defeating me
then these coins will be yours.
If you have strength
then come forward.
Come on!
Chandragupta.. Chandragupta!
Chandragupta.. Chandragupta!
Chandragupta.. Chandragupta!
Look at him, how he is
giving us the wrong knowledge.
You must have understood this.
This is the worth your
thoughts have in Magadh.
Humiliation..
Insult.
Your Majesty, I had the idea
before coming to this assembly
that why it has been held.
Foolish Brahmin!
You still came to play with the fire!
When the country
is about to catch fire
then no one cares about
burning his own hands.
You can make fun of me in
this assembly as much as you want.
You can mistreat
me as much as you want.
I am ready for that.
Because today,
my motive here is not about my respect
it is about the pride of the country.
Whatever I have come here to say today
is directly connected
to Bharat and to Magadh.
And it is connected to you,
Your Majesty Dhananand.
I see!
Is there anything about
Magadh and me which I do not know?
It is a very interesting proposal.
Tell me, Brahmin. Tell me.
Now, this game should be over.
Beat them up.. Beat them up more.
Indra, I suggest that Chandra
should break their teeth.
- If they will not be able to eat,
then will not survive. - Yes.
Had one punch landed on you
it would have been you losing teeth.
How so? Chandragupta is there.
Why do you insult the wrestlers
by getting tied by a kid?
Shall we end this game right here
or is there someone else still left?
The game has only began, kid.
This is no game, Your Majesty.
Rather it is an ambition
which is eager to make a toy out
of Magadh along with entire Bharat.
After Alexander's death
his general Seleucus
is the biggest threat hovering
over Bharat and not just Magadh.
He has
killed the king of Paurav, Puru.
And has established his
rule over Paurav kingdom.
But that snake's belly will not be
satiated only by this much,
Your Majesty.
Soon he shall lay his
eyes on Magadh as well.
And after that gradually
he will establish his
overlordship on entire Bharat.
When?
When will you understand,
naive Brahmin?
There is nothing named
Bharat that exists.
What is this dream
about united Bharat?
How can this ever be possible?
You came as a beggar
at Magadh's doorstep with
the dream of united Bharat.
Do you even remember
how many communities
and languages exist
dialects and kings
exist on this peninsula?
Where there are innumerable
divisions based on birth
profession,
religion, tongues, and traditions
there unity is only a tale, Brahmin!
Only a tale.
Ask anyone about his motherland.
You will find so many answers
you will not be able to count.
Someone would answer Anga,
some would say Branga
Chola, Kashi, Mathura, or Ayodhya.
Have you ever heard someone say that
that Bharat is his land of birth?
No.
Where after every two miles water
and after every 14
miles language changes
that piece of land
can never be united.
Your Majesty,
even Sun's rays have seven colours
but only when they
unite does the Sun shine.
There are several
cords and notes in music
but only when they are
united is the music created.
Several bells together
form a 'ghungroo'.
Even after having several
parts and organs we have one body.
What is the point of that light
that disintegrates into
seven parts after a little rain.
If one voice roars,
the entire song becomes pointless.
One 'ghungroo'..
If only one bell in
a 'ghungroo' goes astray
the sound it produces becomes harsh..
Here even a man's life
is divided into four parts.
Duty, profession,
desire, and salvation.
Where one has to put
effort in order to unite
that unity is of no use.
Do you know what is unity?
Unity comes from wealth.
It takes wealth to create more wealth
and righteousness can be established.
All the desires can
be fulfilled with wealth.
Who needs salvation
if you have wealth.
This is why Magadh is one.
Magadh is a nation because
everything here is based on wealth.
Wealth is at the core of duty,
caste, language and joy as well.
Hence, Magadh has no
threat from anyone Brahmin.
Your worries are for nothing.
Magadh was, is, and always will be.
But that Seleucus
who killed King Puru..
Did you still not understand,
stupid Brahmin?
Puru was also killed due to wealth.
Here, there,
and everywhere there is wealth.
There is me and Magadh!
Do you understand now?
Seleucus will never
form his hood over Magadh.
Because Magadh has filled
his belly by sacrificing Puru.
Not just Puru if anyone
comes between me and Magadh
he shall be removed.
I enjoyed watching you play.
Hence, I thought of
enjoying a little with you.
It is a simple challenge, kid.
Try passing me. I shall accept defeat.
I shall definitely pass through
you but only after defeating you.
Yes! It was I who ended Puru's life.
And I did all this for my society.
That Kshatriya Puru
wanted to suppress us barber Nandas.
And I wanted to prove
that Nanda dynasty is supreme.
It hurts to see an emperor
have such a mentality.
You are proud of being
a barber emperor, Dhananand.
You should be.
Because you struggled
against difficult circumstances
and became an emperor.
I agree your community did
not receive the expected respect.
That was wrong.
But doing wrong cannot set that right,
Dhananand.
Your deeds turned you
into an emperor not your caste.
But you held to the feelings
of your caste and community so tightly
that you forgot all the duties and
responsibilities of being an emperor.
You should have set up an example
before your people and society.
They should have drawn
inspiration from you.
That if they wish to
be safe they should work.
Rather you made everyone insecure,
Dhananand!
You forgot those deeds
due to whom you are an emperor
and seated on this throne.
When a man's personality gets better
his thoughts also expand.
But I must say with utter regret,
Dhananand
that your personality did grow
but your thought remained
extremely narrow.
Shame on such a mentality.
It is my mistake that
I came with such a big dream
to a king with such a small mind.
Such proud on your mentality
that you condemned mine!
Are you not too proud
of your knowledge, wise one?
On this lock that
symbolises your wisdom..
Is it not this lock which
gets your respect in the gatherings?
Today you shall realise
the real place of you and your lock.
Come!
Many egoistic ones
stay on wait for me at
Magadh's gates to get something.
They fall to my feet for a few coins.
They spread their toga to beg.
You claim to be so wise.
Do you even not know that
one must bow in order to get alms.
Get up! Up!
I orchestrated this court only
to finish your dream of united India.
So that everyone here
watches along with you
that I, Dhananand
am a huge, turbulent river while you..
You are just a particle of soil.
Who can do courtesy
to me being on the bank
but if comes on the path
then it shall be washed away!
What good will this ornament
do after your death?
Now whenever this thought
of united Bharat comes to you
then remember this
with your humiliation
that I am the biggest obstruction
on the path of your united Bharat.
It is Magadh, not some foreigner.
Stop, Dhananand!
When a person's ego
reaches its extreme
from that moment and
day his downfall begins.
Remember, Dhananand.
The soil particle that
protects the river as a bank
if it determines then it
can also stop its flow as a rock.
Mark this day in your memories,
Dhananand.
You shall remember this day
when I shall turn your
into a pauper from king.
The mentality which
is foundation to progress
shall now act as a weapon
to destroy you, Dhananand.
The lock you have insulted today..
I, Acharya Vishnugupta Chanakya
swear by that same lock
that I shall annihilate
your Nanda dynasty, Dhananand.
I shall uproot you from this throne
and put a worthy ruler on it.
Until
I fulfill this oath of mine
I shall
not tie my lock.
"He is Chanakya.."
"He is Chanakya.."
Bharat will be one great nation.
And there will be one
emperor to rule over it.
One that will cast a
dark shadow on you, Dhananand.
One that will mark the beginning of a
new era which will begin by your end.

================================================================================

Episode: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-XgDNukZlQ

You have compared
me to a speck of dust
and I from this very dust
I will bring forth a great emperor!
"Chandragupta! Chandragupta!"
One whose every breath carries
the will of a united Land of Bharat!
One is not dead till he draws breath.
You have made a grave
mistake by touching this jewel.
And you will pay dearly for it.
One that will end your line!
"Chandragupta Maurya!"
One that will rise
as the unblemished moon
and he will cast a dark shadow on you,
Dhananand.
"Chandragupta Maurya!"
Dhananand, one just needs
a fine head to run a body.
One becomes a demon
if governed by ten heads.
And now Bharat will
be one great nation.
And there will be one
emperor to rule over it.
One who will kill a demon like you.
One that will guide
the Land of Bharat.
One that will mark the beginning of a
new era which will begin by your end.
"Chandragupta Maurya!"
"Chandragupta Maurya!"
"I am Vishnugupta Chanakya
and I will not tie my locks"
"till I end the line of Nand dynasty!"
"I will bring forth a great
emperor from this soil of Magadh!"
A priest turned into a wizard!
Bringing forth a ruler from the soil!
My Lord.
Do not waste your time,
thinking over Chanakya.
It is impossible to supplant
you from the throne.
It is a fool's dream and
that is all it will ever be.
It will never be fulfilled.
What did you say, Councillor?
Chanakya's dream?
Wise ones.
If I am not mistaken then this entire
creation is a dream of Lord Vishnu.
- Right?
- Yes, Sire.
Now, I understand.
Vishnugupta Chanakya thinks
of himself as Lord Vishnu
and wishes to fulfill his dream.
Councillor.
The eyes that wish
to see Magadha in ruins..
Should such eyes be
allowed to remain open?
I understand, my Lord.
Chanakya is shrewd and very wise.
Thus he has earned his title,
'Kautilya'.
He is not going to submit by force.
I must leave in order
to force him in submission.
Allow me to leave.
Wise ones.
What ritual do you seek
to save someone's life?
Yes! A prayer to Lord of death,
Chant of Lord Mahamrityunjaya.
Now you shall see.
You all will stand witness
that even a great ritual of God
cannot save the man
that challenges Magadha.
Begin the chant at once!
[Sanskrit chants]
[Sanskrit chants]
[Sanskrit chants]
Chanting of Mahamrityunjaya
spell from the court suddenly?
Dhananand has sent assassins after me.
Leave at once.
Where will we go now, Acharya?
This is the north-eastern
part of the palace.
According to the foundations
and the architecture
there must be a hidden passage to
the south. We must proceed over there.
When will we get the new
emperor to end this vile Dhananand!
'Mother!'
'Mother!'
Splendid!
Splendid, Chandragupta.
It was a great duel.
Such a joy to see.
So where did you get such strength?
We are given a family at birth
and we make another
when we pick as friends.
And I could not lose
the ones that I had chosen.
Chandra,
you appear to be a simple being
and yet your moves are cunning.
When one faces a crooked path in life
one learns a few tricks on the way.
That is not all.
Your actions have turned ill.
You all robbed my father! Thieves!
There you go! You are blaming me?
You asked us to steal
from your father.
I asked for two coins so that
I can have my friend's father healed.
You took ten.
Give me back the rest.
Why do you ask?
Everything has a price!
We have worked hard and
we must be paid for that.
Two coins for your friend
and the rest eight is our
wage to steal those two coins.
to steal those two coins.
A price of eight coins to steal two?
Yes, indeed. Such is the state.
Eight coins for four people.
Two for Indra. Two for Sthool.
Two for Dhumketu.
And the rest for you.
You needed an anklet.
I taught you all the tricks
and now you started to trick me?
Bhairav, over there.
But you said the passage
was at the other side!
If you pay no heed to markers
while looking for a direction
you may end up in trouble.
What do you mean?
Look at the flame of this torch.
It has been fed oil recently.
So the guards are around.
It is troublesome to stay here.
But Acharya, this is the final
way out amongst those five pathways.
I must make a way out for myself
to reach the goal that I seek,
Bhairav.
Come with me.
A vase full of flowers in secret cave.
This must be a marker
of a secret way out right here.
Bhairav, come with me.
The vase has fallen.
Someone must have been here.
Could be a rodent, Councillor.
There are lots of rats
in this part of the castle.
And rats are masters
in finding their way.
I have found the way out, Bhairav.
Look at that rat.
It definitely came
in through the sewer.
And each sewers end
at a lake or a well.
We will have to find the sewer
if we are to get out of here.
Do you see this?
When this black and shiny liquid comes
in contact with your body and dries
it takes skin with it when peeled.
Did you hear the sound?
It is not a sound but
a call that you are my servant.
A servant that I bought
for 100 'Pan' years ago.
A servant's earning,
be it from hard work or negotiations
be it from begging alms or stealing
the master has the right to it.
That is the rule.
And you broke the rule.
That is why your punishment
is to stay inside
the black liquid for three hours.
I want independence.
Chandragupta has never
mentioned freedom before.
What is going on inside his mind?
Do you not think that you
have dreamed the impossible?
This is due to your family.
They sold you and washed their
hands off from their responsibility.
And now you dare desire
freedom from slavery!
I do not want freedom.
I want to know the price of freedom.
Listen to me properly, Master.
I will steal 500 'Pan' in return
of 100 'Pan' you bought me with.
In return, you will have to free me.
Do you accept it?
Why do you have to get angry about it?
If I throw you inside the black liquid
and close it for nine hours
you will die.
Do you accept it?
I promise to free you.
I accept it.
You do not know your own worth,
Chandragupta.
Someone has to tell
you what you are worth.
Acharya, it is so dark here.
Magadha is also under the
cover of such darkness, Bhairav.
But they say that when
darkness is at its most
light exists nearby.
Come here quickly.
[Sanskrit chants]
When there's a doubt in your mind
even the weapon in
your hand is of no use.
This is no time for such foolishness,
but to take a decision.
Whose Minister are you?
Magadha Kingdom or
that arrogant Dhananand?
Magadh and the King are
not separate for me, Vishnugupta.
I am equally dedicated towards them.
Then why did you stop?
I didn't stop because I've a doubt,
but because of dignity.
And only for that.
I respect you, so I will give
you one last chance, Vishnugupta.
Stay away from the borders of Magadha.
You must be forgetting
that I took an oath
to find the future emperor
from the Magadha who will unite India.
Amatya Rakshas,
I am carrying out my duty.
You think about your own duties.
You have invited your death,
Vishnugupta!
What was that, Acharya?
Balance, Bhairav.
Balance.
Amatya Rakshas has
carried out his duties
as a Brahman by not taking my life.
But Amatya Rakshas I know
will leave no stone unturned
from now onwards to find
me and kill me to fulfill his duties
towards his king.
But you still do not seem concerned.
It is because Amatya Rakshas
will never be able to find me again.
Dhana Nanda made a mistake.
He should not have arranged for
a 'Mahamrityunjaya
Mantra' veneration for me.
Magadha King Dhananand
will have to pay a hefty price
for his mistake.
The axe is sharp enough to
cut through the shackles of slavery.
Leave, Chandragupta.
He will never be able to find you.
So why are you still
accepting the shackles?
You cannot go without answering
my question, Chandragupta.
You will have to tell me
what it is that holds you back.
What is the secret behind the bangle
that it gives you so much strength
that you even defeated Mahamalla.
Why do you put your
life on line to protect it?
Answer me.
I have not answered
your question for years now.
Why do you think that
today will be any different?
It is because I have never
seen you so frantic to become free.
Chandragupta, you say that
we are born into one family
and we choose our other
family in form of friends.
Are you going to keep secrets
from your chosen family?
I am not burdening you.
I just want you to relieve yourself
of of the burden of your heart.
Who is it that gave you the wound
that you can neither
forget nor forgive?
There is someone
I do not want to love.
Someone who gave birth to me,
my mother.
Look at her, the Queen of Piplivan.
Ever since she lost her kingdom,
she drops everything.
What queen! She's a servant.
A slave who receives no wages.
Emperor
I got the clothes for
you especially from Egypt
as a birthday gift.
If you do not like it, then
then this
Persian jerkin will suit you as well.
How much did you spend on this?
Not much, Emperor.
Just 10,000 'Pan'.
Then it is good.
You foolish slave!
Can you not watch where you are going!
You are not the queen of Piplivan
that you can go around as you wish.
You are a slave of Magadha.
Apologise to the emperor!
Apologise to the emperor!
Pandu, my Brother!
Even if money is on the ground
you should not kick
as if it were some stone.
She is not an ordinary servant.
She a former queen of Piplivan!
Talk to her politely and with respect.
Apologise to me, Mura.
A coin on the ground loses its lustre.
You have to do something for that.
Hatred is stronger
than love.
This bangle is the
symbol of that hatred.
It keeps reminding me.
My mother..
The Minister is thirsty
for your blood, Acharya.
How will you give this
kingdom the successor it needs?
Magadha might be
tortured by Dhananand.
But one day, someone will arrive
as the moon to calm everything down.

================================================================================

Episode: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59BpBYEWZU4

Apologise to the King!
Your Highness. I washed her head.
Now, bow.
Bow before the king
of Magadha and apologise.
You are ready to stand here
in drenched clothes and get insulted.
Only if you apologise to
me will your honour be tarnished.
- Such pride?
- Not pride.
It's self-respect.
If I apologise, then it will
be proved that I committed a crime.
Whereas, the truth is that
you did not stick to your words.
Only he apologises
who makes a mistake.
A grain of sand became a golden gage!
Let me show you your true value. Come.
Hundred gages.
The one who gave birth to me
set hundred gages as
the price of her child.
If I run away today
then I will be under
the debt of that all my life.
That is why I will go!
But after repaying that price!
And then I will ask her
for the price of my life!
Of my childhood!
She left this bangle in inheritance.
Now, this bangle will lead me to her!
As soon as I repay the debt
I will find her!
And then I will ask her
why she let slavery be my fate!
That you never questioned your destiny
that why did it show this day to you.
How did you become
a maid from a queen? Come.
Get up.
Do you remember that this
sword and blood stained on it.
This is your husband's blood.
Apart from marriage,
there was one more thing
which kept you both connected,
and that was
the stubborn nature of you both.
This is my stubbornness.
I have decided.
My hatred will become the
path for me to reach my mother.
I showed you the path
to spend a happy life.
To keep your eyes on
the ground and bow before me.
But no.
Neither you looked down
nor did you stop hating me!
I will be at peace
only when I get the answer.
Why did she give birth to me
if she had to hate me!
To get the answer to
this is my stubbornness!
You are making your life more
difficult with your stubbornness.
Look at yourself. Look.
Look here. You were a queen
and now a tired,
helpless maid servant.
The blood of a warrior,
which is boiling in your veins
I will make it cold like
water in which all your hopes
will settle down.
And you will lose
the hope of your freedom.
As long as I am alive
there is hope, Dhananand.
And I will not die
until my son Chandragupta
comes to kill you.
That is why
I handed him over to my brother.
So that he could be safe
from you and then he could come
in front of you after
growing up to kill you.
I have endured the pain of my son.
'Mother..'
'Mother..'
I tolerated everything
for the day
when my Chandragupta comes
to free not just me
but entire Magadha from this torment.
Once I am free
I will find her no
matter where she is.
And I will ask her why
she sold me off as a slave.
The whole kingdom
is in search for you.
How will you give this
kingdom the successor it needs?
We must find him first, Bhairav.
But I have a feeling
that he is around.
The future king of Magadha
must be born on this very land.
How will you recognise him?
It is easy.
The one who is immensely patriotic
will finish the arrogant Dhananand.
Patience might trouble us
like the heat of the fierce sun
but the radiance of
the moon always soothes it.
Magadha might be
tortured by Dhananand.
But one day
someone will arrive as
the moon to calm everything down.
'The love for the motherland
comes from care for a mother.'
'Chanakya was not yet aware'
'that to instil patriotism and love'
'into the one fated
to fulfill his wish'
'would be very difficult.'
'Besides, what is a dream
if not difficult to achieve?'
Do not be scared.
I will not peel off your skin.
At least not on the
anniversary of my birth.
It is done!
Hail King Dhananand.
Best wishes on this day.
Please come here, Your Highness.
Brother!
The people of Magadha love you so much
that on this day
they wish to be part
of the grand celebration.
This is not love.
This is the fear within them, Brother.
And I love to have it that way!
This is an extremely
precious and rare gem.
A present?
I like it.
Besides, a special guest will
be joining us for the celebration.
The great commander-in-chief Seleucus.
And we must welcome special guests
with special robes.
This is nothing, Brother.
Your brothers have not
given you any present yet
which you will receive
after the celebration.
A present which will match your glory.
Something that will only add
to the honour of you and your kingdom.
Splendid! I love such presents.
But beware!
This is my celebration
and that of Magadha.
And often, such grand celebrations
invite great troubles.
Make sure
I do not get upset.
This is the perfect chance.
King of Magadha is
having a celebration
and the entire kingdom
will be busy celebrating
while the soldiers
will be on guard there.
We can use
this chance
I am not interested
in the King of Magadha
and not in his celebration either.
Just tell me what I need to do
to have my independence.
Do not act smart.
I am coming to that.
Many precious gifts will
be sent to the King in chariots.
You must steal just one of them.
You need to bring it to me
to be free from me.
Lubdhak! Have you lost it?
Which chariot?
Chandra..
This is not courage, but stupidity.
Wrong. This is absolutely wrong.
Chandragupta, this is not a game.
If we get caught, we would die.
Do you see this symbol?
The chariot with
this will be our target.
After the chariot passes the people
during the celebration,
it will be taken to the dungeon.
That is where you must steal it from.
This will be the
price for your freedom.
And in exchange,
you will be free from me.
I do not accept this plan.
Wow! Such a wise decision!
You were being all high and mighty.
Why are you backing out now?
I never said I would not do it.
I said
that I will not do
it according to this plan.
I will steal that chariot
but not at night.
I will do it in broad daylight
during the celebration.
I will get the entire chariot
in the presence of everyone.
Unbelievable!
You will die and you
will have me killed too.
You have lost the ability to think.
There is no better distraction
than a crowd, Lubdhak.
All the soldiers will be
guarding the chariots at night.
But during the day,
they will be relaxed.
Nobody would even imagine
that among so many people
someone would steal them.
It is Dhananand's
birth anniversary today.
It is mandatory
for every person
in Magadha to wish him.
Brother once told me
that he had sold Chandra
off as a slave when he needed money.
He was still wearing
my bangle in his neck.
Perhaps..
Perhaps the buyer will come here too.
And even my Chandra!
I will recognise him
when I see the chain.
Did you hear that?
When I find him, I will tell him
that the person whose
celebration he is attending
is the one because of
whom our family was ruined.
My son will exact revenge.
He will make him pay
for every sin he committed.
He will avenge ever tear I cried.
He will avenge his lost childhood
and return my lost honour.
Once I find Chandra
Dhananand's end is inevitable.
On the birth anniversary
celebration of the King
most of the people of
Magadha will participate.
All the young men
and women will attend it.
This is the perfect opportunity
to find the future king.
You are right, Acharya.
And my informer Murli can
help you to pick the right youth.
Shatkar..
You are an old friend
and a learned man
so you must know
that informers cannot
be completely trusted
as all they care about is money.
But I can trust him.
Because Dhananand
killed his entire family
and he wishes to avenge their death.
But how will I recognise Murli?
You do not have to.
He will approach you
and to prove he is the one
he will hand over the
remaining part of this to you.
The plan will be
executed in three stages.
Taking positions, creating mayhem
and distracting the soldiers.
First, we will take positions.
I will be up here to
watch everything carefully.
You..
You must stay at the gate.
Indra, Dhum,
you must dress as charioteers.
The chariot we need
to steal has this symbol.
Now, the second stage of our plan.
Creating mayhem.
We will do that to
create panic among people.
And this will be done
by you, my friend.
After that, once there is panic
I will jump on the chariot
we need to steal and ride it outside.
Indra and Dhumketu,
you must follow my chariot with yours.
And you must also have
these symbols on your chariots.
Now comes the third
and most important stage.
Distracting the soldiers.
We will ride our chariots
into different directions.
That will split the soldiers.
Then, we will make them
each follow only one chariot
and complete our plan.
It is a simple plan.
And we simply die!
Chandra, instead of being
tortured in the dungeons of Magadha
- it is better we stay slaves.
- I hope you remember
that I will make
sure that you are safe.
Chandragupta, you will
save us but who will save you?
What is the point of such freedom
where you do not have
your life to enjoy it?
I want freedom for sure
no matter what the cost is.
I will definitely
find Chanakya, Murli.
From now on, you are Murli.
Yes, Minister.
Acharya Chanakya?
'It will be a special day.'
'I will attain freedom.'
'And then,
I will find answers to my questions.'

================================================================================

Episode: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCQR3qFPM0w

Amazing!
Today is a great day.
It will be a special day.
I will attain freedom.
And then,
I will find answers to my questions.
Today, your special
training will be put to use.
You will protect the chariot
filled with precious gifts.
You have to always keep
an eye on that chariot.
Shadow the chariot
with all your might.
Bhairav, concentrate on finding Murli.
He will be carrying
the rest of this coin as a sign.
Brother
where did the gem on your clothes go?
No..
Do not talk about that gem now.
Keep quiet until
Minister Rakshas arrives.
Minister, according to your order
we have deployed our
soldiers to look for Chanakya.
Even if he comes here
he will be under a guise.
How will we look for him?
Keep your eyes open and brain sharp.
You will definitely find a clue.
Come with me.
I had to benefit
from this celebration.
I met you after so many years, Murli.
Come, let us inquire
about each other's well-being.
Let us go.
I know that you are
here to meet Chanakya.
Just tell me
where you are going to meet him.
Speak!
Will you give me Chanakya
or your life?
I do not want to die, Minister.
I will take you to Chanakya.
Please untie my hands.
Do remember
that if you exhibit
foolishness then you will die.
Yes, Minister.
Untie his hands!
You want to meet Chanakya, do you not?
Ask my dead body the same.
You will not find Chanakya.
Nand will be destroyed.
I will definitely
find Chanakya, Murli.
And the Nands will never be destroyed.
From now on, you are Murli.
Yes, Minister.
Look for the man
who has the rest of this coin.
He will be
Vishnugupta Chanakya.
Minister, the king is calling for you.
Minister?
Chandra
there are many soldiers here.
Do not worry.
I will go and serve
this beverage to them.
They will run somewhere
else as soon as they drink it.
When that soldier leaves,
take his place.
Did you get it?
Yes.
I am trying.
Acharya Chanakya?
Cold beverage!
Cold beverage!
It is for all our
brave and loyal soldiers!
Please take it..
Have it.
Please take it.
It is a cold beverage. Have it.
Hey.. Please have it.
I assure you that it
will relieve you of tiredness.
Hail King Dhananand.
The security is tight, Your Majesty.
Soon, Chanakya will be caught.
I do not care about Chanakya,
Minister.
You find the ones
you set your eyes upon.
I have called you here
to watch a delightful game.
Servant
bring a cold beverage for me.
Hey.. Will you allow the king to be thirsty
for whose birthday you
are catering to everyone?
Why are you still here, you fool?
Follow the king's order. Hurry up!
He stole the gem that was mine!
It means he stole Magadha's happiness!
The one who steals the king's property
deserves to die.
A free service in Magadha! Amazing!
If you are so eager to serve the king
then come with me.
I will take you to him.
Hey.. No..
I was promoting my beverage.
So, when people want to drink it
I will be able to
earn double the money.
I do not have the courage
to stand in front of the king.
It is all right.
`If you do not want to
drink it I will drink it.
All right.
Now, there is no more beverage left
and I will leave as well.
So, tell me, Murli
from where did we start looking
for the next emperor of Magadha?
This place is not suitable to
talk about such confidential matters.
We should go to a secret place.
A secret place?
I hope that you already
have a secret place to talk.
All right,
go ahead and I will follow you.
Please forgive me.
Murli!
This pouch of coins was fallen here.
Is it yours?
Yes.. It is mine.
'It means that Murli was caught.'
'He is definitely a royal spy.'
Excuse me!
Here is your pouch of coins.
Keep your money safe in Magadha.
May that beverage seller suffer!
I wonder what he served me.
- My stomach is upset.
- Excuse me.
- What is it?
- Your Dhoti.
What happened to it?
This attire is a bit tight for me.
Hey.. This attire is fine.
You are a bit too large for it.
Remember this.
Our plan's success
depends on this pot.
Yes.. I know that.
I have taken the first
step towards you, Mother.
Mother, I do not want to go!
'Mother!'
'Mother!'
Chandra?
Mother, I do not want to go.
Mother, I do not want to go.
Mother, I do not want to go.
I want to stay with you.
Forgive me, Son.
Forgive your mother.
- No..
- Stop!
How much did you pay for this boy?
How much did you pay
for buying that mother's love?
Fifteen hundred coins.
Do you have them?
This gem is more
valuable than 1500 coins.
Keep it.
She is paying so much!
That too, for a servant.
That gem is indeed valuable
but for a mother,
her child is most valuable of all.
You will not understand
the value of a mother's tears.
Today, you have brought
a mother and her child together.
I will pray to the Lord wholeheartedly
that you get whatever you wish for.
Thrash him 10 times for one chapatti.
Not to him but to me.
If the king is not able to
satisfy the hunger of his people
then the king is at
fault and not the people.
'In National Games, we will
get the solution of a country.'

================================================================================

Episode: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJfpVjbSrE0

You have helped unite
me with my child.
I will pray to Him
that may He blesses you
with whatever you seek.
Apologies, lady. I failed
to see you as I was in a rush.
Who was he?
Why did it feel as if I know him?
'Why is the guard not in his place?'
Stop it.
Where is the guard?
Go and find him.
I shall check this chariot.
Where have you been?
I went to answer nature's call.
At this time?
Nature's call may come at any time.
Your physique says it all.
Good to go!
That was close.
Everything is now in your hands,
Chandragupta.
"Chandragupta!"
"Chandragupta!"
Begin the entertainment.
What is he doing here?
I am in trouble.
Hey, you!
Who are you?
How and why did you come here?
Oh! I just came here casually.
There is a lot of crowd down there.
So, I came here to
enjoy some fresh air.
Are you not the same boy
who was distributing free drinks?
Oh, wow! I will tell this to everyone
that a soldier of the
royal palace knows me.
Thank you. I do not think
your intentions are right.
One has to struggle so hard
even to enjoy some fresh hard.
'I should make sure
he does not see this rope.'
I cannot inhale this polluted air
anymore exhaled by these poor people.
I have to go to the palace, Pandu.
Anyway, I am feeling like
some work is pending.
The environment is so nice.
Why are you provoking the anger
of His Majesty on this occasion?
Let us go to the palace.
It will be a huge trouble
if anyone spots you here.
Ramya, it will be a trouble
if I do not get to see him.
I know that he is here.
I got an opportunity
after so much of difficulty.
I cannot lose it again.
Listen. Come with me.
Otherwise,
I will have to inform the guards.
Do not miss this time.
This is the last chance.
Sthulabhadra!
Start your game.
Hey! What are you doing?
What is there in this pot?
Gift.
Hey, mister! Wasp on your neck!
Jump!
Move.
Move aside.
Sthulabhadra! Hurry up! Run..
Sthulabhadra..
I know, you were here, Chandragupta.
A mother's faith says
that her son was here.
Where are you?
Have you decided
to get yourself killed?
Do you want to put me in danger too?
Let's go from here.
Arrest him!
Go away from here.
It is a matter of great shame, Amatya.
Someone breaches such
a high security area
and steals precious
gifts meant for the emperor
in front of the subjects
at such a big event.
And we stand here bowing our heads.
This is an insult.
- This is an insult of Magadh.
- Impossible!
No one can dare to insult Magadh
in the presence of this Rakshas.
I still feel that the
thief and the stolen stuff
are still accessible to us.
Do not worry, elder brother.
Dhananand's wealth
cannot go away from him.
But, Your Majesty,
I am not able to figure out
who can dare to loot the
gift meant for Magadh's emperor
from his birthday celebration?
He did not loot it.
It is just a token.
It is an opportunity
for me to teach a lesson.
And are you not aware that I take
pleasure in teaching such lessons?
Especially to those who
set their eyes on Magadh's wealth.
The task is over.
But this hairstyle
suits him better, right?
Now I wish to do hairstyle
to that person who stole my gift.
How will he escape
from this barber Nand?
He will reveal his
identity by himself.
One who robbed Dhananand
right from under his nose..
I want him!
As powerful as a desert storm.
As accomplished as
a lion at leading his pack.
He has got all the characteristics
which I see in the future of Bharat.
He will be the emperor
of the united Bharat.

================================================================================

Episode: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhagPWNUvEc

Sthulabhadra!
Sthulabhadra, faster! Run! Run!
Sthulabhadra!
Last stage! Faster!
Oh, God! A bear!
That foolish bandit ran away scared.
Did anybody see you?
Where is Sthulabhadra?
'Sthulabhadra..'
Listen..
You are a young boy.
You seem to be strong and healthy.
You seem clever, too.
What was the need to steal then?
It was not for my need,
but for my friendship.
That is how my friend is.
Once he makes
up his mind, his decision is final.
And we follow his orders
once he decides something.
I am going
to bring Sthulabhadra back.
But how?
Chandra,
he must have been caught there.
There is no way out from there.
It is not difficult for Chandra
who guides others in the dark.
It's fine if I find a way.
Otherwise,
I will find a way out on my own.
You seem unworried.
Have you ever thought
that you may spend the
rest of your life in Magadh's jail?
Stop worrying about me.
Think about yourself.
A jail term in this old
age will be difficult for you.
My friend will save me either way.
Hadn't I told you
that my friend will come?
- "Chandragupta!"
- Who is it?
"Chandragupta!"
Catch him!
Be ready, sire.
We will be freed soon.
- We?
- Yes, we!
- Come!
- What about that man?
He has
also been held captive!
- Do you have any friend?
- No.
Help yourself, then.
Come!
Your king's birthday has brought
only bad luck for you, Amatya Rakshas.
Neither did you
get hold of me, nor this thief.
No!
There were 200 of you.
And they were just two.
And they deceived you.
They were a scholar and a kid.
Are you not
ashamed of yourselves.
The lad who came to rescue
them was as fast as lightning.
He arrived like a storm and took them
away before we could even realise!
Get lost!
The wrath of the emperor
would have cost you your lives
had he not
found the gift on time!
You all would have been
cemented in the walls of Magadh!
Seal all exits in Magadh.
No one should enter
or leave the kingdom!
I want them both at any cost!
Go!
This must be the result
of Chanakya's cunning ploy.
But who was that lad
who decided to risk his own life?
Residents of Magadh
this special arrangement has
been made on the occasion of my
which means Magadh's
birth anniversary!
And a very special
guest is going to be
a part of this grand celebration!
The one who is worthy
of Magadh's alliance.
He is the general
of Alexander who conquered the world
but did not dare to face Magadh.
I am happy
that the one before
whom the entire world bows
has extended his
friendship towards Magadh!
He is aware of his strength
but also acknowledges
the strength of Magadh!
Please welcome with joy,
the friend of Magadh
and the great General, Seleucus!
You have come as a special
guest on the occasion of my birthday.
I am very happy.
Now, I will give you the honour
of witnessing the
unveiling of the statue
which has been gifted
to me by my elder brothers.
100 feet long and 20 feet wide.
This statue of the emperor
has been made of gold.
It has been
constructed in seven parts
epresenting the love
of His Majesty's seven brothers.
Wonderful!
A golden
statue as big as this
will surely represent the reputation
and valour of the emperor of Magadh.
Undoubtedly.. Undoubtedly..
It will keep our enemies
away from our border
and will teach my friends
to be in their limits.
Sure, Emperor.
When the objectives
are same while ruling
alliance is possible.
If objectives are different,
friends get separated.
I pray to God that we both
our objectives remain the same.
So that, the sword which
rises to honour each other
should not slash each other.
This! This is
what I like about you, Seleucus.
Your words are sharp
as a blade and your thoughts..
As witty as a horse rider! Wonderful!
Come. Let us revel
in the celebration. Come.
Who was that lad?
The one who has risen
from the soil of Magadh.
Faster than the wind, with
a temper like the wrath of the ocean.
As powerful as a desert storm.
Skilled at dealing with danger.
As accomplished as
a lion at leading his pack.
Willing to sacrifice
his life for his friends.
And selfless enough to save the life
of a stranger like me.
He has got all the characteristics
which I see in the future of Bharat.
He will be the emperor
of the united Bharat.
What was the name of that lad?
A goldsmith only examines
the ore within a rock
and it is after
the forging that the gem finds a name.
And I have to find him
to forge him into a warrior.
Forgive me, Acharya.
But how can a young lad who wears
a woman's ornament round his neck
be a great Emperor?
This ornament must surely
belong to his mother.
And only a true warrior
carries the courage
to wear his feelings on
his chest as pride, Bhairav.
Give it a thought, Bhairav.
One who has such love for his mother..
How deeply would
he love his motherland!
And the fools
that dare raise their
voices against Magadh
will lose their honour
when they will see the grandeur
of the mighty statue
of the Lord of Magadha!
As radiant, as it is prosperous!
From the head to the toe!
This will be the great
form of Emperor Dhananand
that neither the world
will forget nor History, itself!
- Hail Emperor Dhananand!
- Hail!
- Hail Emperor Dhananand!
- Hail!
- Hail Emperor Dhananand!
- Hail!
- Hail Emperor Dhananand!
- Hail!
- Hail Emperor Dhananand!
- Hail!
- Hail Emperor Dhananand!
- Hail!
- Hail Emperor Dhananand!
- Hail!
- Hail Emperor Dhananand!
- Hail!
- Hail Emperor Dhananand!
- Hail!
- Hail Emperor Dhananand!
- Hail!
It is indeed a marvelous
creation. Indeed!
Such is the true form
of the Lord of Magadh.
From his torso to his toes,
clad in gold
but his head ever
remains one of a donkey.
One of that fool who when sees
a dried path of grass
in summer ends up thinking
that he ate it all and considers
himself as the strongest.
It is truly said.
No one will ever forget
this form of the Emperor
nor will history.
Brother!
What a splendid creation this is!
Splendid, indeed!
Amazing! Amusing!
Everyone here knows
well how I love good humour!
And who apart from my brothers
who knows best how to
bring a smile to my face!
Brother,
this is indeed a great statue!
One who robbed Dhananand
right from under his nose..
I want him!
There are some teens
behind this event.
But no one saw their faces.
But I will have them captured soon.
Minister..
You are known far and
wide for your mathematics.
So I need your help in estimating
how many young people
exist in Magadha.
About 2,00,000 strong.
So be it,
the youth amount in such numbers.
How many of them would be boys?
Around 1,10,000, my Lord.
Now if one were to estimate
how many of them would
be aged around 15 or 16?
Around 25,000, my Lord.
So these are the 25,000 young boys
of Magadha in the age of 15 to 16!
So, bring only these
boys inside the palace walls
and kill them all!
But, my Lord..
Thousands to pay for the crime of one?
Minister,
it must be one of these who stole
the golden head of
the Emperor of Magadh!
Before his audacity
incites other young men
we must destroy them all
that could pose a threat
to Magadh in future.
And I have been humiliated
in front of Seleucus.
If I do not avenge it anyone
may rise against me in future.
I want them all
summoned in the palace.
I will have them all
punished with death or their audacity!
Thrash him 10 times for one chapatti.
Not to him but to me.
If the king is not able to
satisfy the hunger of his people
then the king is at
fault and not the people.
'In National Games, we will
get the solution of a country.'

Indra, Chandragupta#- It was fun today.
- Yes.
Chandragupta#And in two days for the second time
Chandragupta#I was saved from getting imprisoned.
Chandragupta#We will not include Sthulbhadra
in our plan in future.
Sthulbhadra#What wrong have I done?
Sthulbhadra#I was just..
Sthulbhadra#Chandra, your bangle.
Indra#Did you drop it?
Chandragupta#I might've dropped
it during the looting.
Lubdhak#Where are you going, slave?
Lubdhak#Why do you look so amazed?
Lubdhak#Until I'm satisfied
Lubdhak#that my task is complete
I will treat you as my slave.
Lubdhak#Come on. Open up this chest.
Chandragupta#My task was limited
to stealing this chest.
Lubdhak#Hey!
Lubdhak#Do not try to act smart.
Lubdhak#You were supposed to hand it to me.
Lubdhak#Go and open it up.
Lubdhak#Get going.
Chandragupta(V/O)#'This ornament serves
as a token to remind me'
Chandragupta(V/O)#'of my mother.'
Lubdhak#What is this?
Lubdhak#This is the head of
the king's golden idol.
Male1#Bring everyone here!
Male1#According to His Majesty
Dhananand's order
Male1#the thief is one among them.
Male1#Arrest all the boys.
Male2#Have pity on my son, sir.
Male2#Sir.
Male2#Sir, my son is innocent.
Male2#My son is innocent.
Please spare him. Have pity on us.
Male2, Male child1#- Have pity on him, sir.
My son is innocent. - Father..
Male child1, Male2#- Father, save me. Father..
- Leave him.
Female1#What harm does our innocent
children have done to anyone?
Female1#Let them go.
Female1#Let go our childrens. Let them go.
Vishnugupta#All the boys of that age in Magadh
are being thrown into the dungeon.
Vishnugupta#Once that boy gets to know of this
Vishnugupta#he will surely try
to escape from Magadh.
Vishnugupta#Before Dhananand gets his hands on him
Vishnugupta#I must find him.
Lubdhak#Chandra, the chest with
which you have replaced this
Lubdhak#what did you put in it?
Lubdhak#Answer me, Chandra!
Lubdhak#What did you put in it?
Mura(V/O)#'It is such an irony..'
Mura(V/O)#'This is what your true form is,
Your Majesty.'
Mura(V/O)#'Indeed your whole
body is adorned with gold'
Mura(V/O)#'but your head is that of a donkey.'
Mura(V/O)#'He is that idiot who thinks
he has eaten all the grass'
Mura(V/O)#'after seeing patches
of dried grass around.'
Mura(V/O)#'Assuming he is the strongest now.'
Mura(V/O)#'He is right.'
Mura(V/O)#'No one in this world will forget
this image of Emperor Dhananand.'
Mura(V/O)#'Nor will the history.'
Mura(V/O)#'Husband, today,
I felt the presence of our son'
Mura(V/O)#'Chandragupta, during the festival.'
Mura(V/O)#'A mother's belief
says that he was my son.'
Mura(V/O)#'Where are you, Chandra?'
Lubdhak#What have you done?
Lubdhak#With whose permission did you do this?
Chandragupta#Whom should have I asked?
Chandragupta, Lubdhak#-You asked me to loot it.
- Me?
Lubdhak#I asked you? Am I out of my mind
Lubdhak#that I will invite
the emperor's wrath?
Lubdhak#This means
Lubdhak#the person with whom I made a deal
Lubdhak#has betrayed me.
Chandragupta#Whom did you make a deal with?
Lubdhak#No idea.
Lubdhak#His face was covered.
Lubdhak#I just saw a ring with
royal emblem on his right hand.
Lubdhak#How would I know that someone
wearing a ring with national emblem
Lubdhak#made me do something
against the emperor?
Lubdhak#I will be in trouble.
Lubdhak#No.
Lubdhak#Pick this up.
Lubdhak#Go far from here and melt it.
Lubdhak#What are you waiting for?
Come on. Hurry Up.
Lubdhak#Come on.
Lubdhak, Chandragupta#- Lift this.
- Wait.
Chandragupta#No one will go anywhere.
Chandragupta#You did not see the person
with whom you made the deal.
Chandragupta#Nor do you know why he made this deal.
Chandragupta#But I remember the
deal that I made with you.
Chandragupta#And as per the deal, you will free me
Chandragupta, Lubdhak#- after this loot.
- To heck with the deal.
Lubdhak#And darn that promise I made.
Lubdhak#If the emperor learns
about our thievery
Lubdhak#neither you nor any deal will exist.
Lubdhak#Everyone will get freedom.
Lubdhak#Not only from slavery
but also from their lives.
Lubdhak#Everyone's head will be
chopped in exchange of this head.
Chandragupta#I am least concerned about you.
Chandragupta#But I am going to
be unshackled for sure.
Chandragupta#If you do not unshackle me,
I will unshackle myself.
Chandragupta#Don't move forward.
Chandragupta#Otherwise before breaking the chains
Chandragupta#I will chop you off into pieces.
Chandragupta#Well, Lubdhak, farewell.
Lubdhak#You are breaking the rule, Chandra.
Lubdhak#A slave cannot leave without
his master's permission.
Lubdhak#I will ask the emperor to punish you.
Chandragupta#Go ahead.
And take this chest with you.
Chandragupta#The king should know
the one who asked for justice
Chandragupta#is also the one who dishonoured him.
Lubdhak#Chandra,
if you go you will never find out
Lubdhak#where your mother is!
Chandragupta#What did you just say?
Lubdhak#Yes, I know where your mother is.
Lubdhak#You are anxious to become
free to look for her, right?
Chandragupta#You knew for such a long time!
Chandragupta#Why did you not tell me then?
Lubdhak#It is because a trump card
is hidden until the very end.
Lubdhak#I kept it a secret
for a situation like this.
Lubdhak#If you want to know
where your mother is
Lubdhak#you will have to do as I say.
Lubdhak#Take the golden head
from here and become free.
Lubdhak#If you do this job
Lubdhak#I will tell you where you mother is.
Lubdhak#If King Dhananand finds
out about my involvement
Lubdhak#you will never find
out where your mother is.
Mura#Chandragupta?
Mura#Such anger!
Mura#Looks like Lord of Magadh
Mura#is still thinking
about his grand idol.
Dhananand#I should give you
the same type of death
Dhananand#as I gave it to your husband.
Dhananand#Along with you the memories
of husband are also over.
Dhananand#Your sufferings will be over.
Mura#Along with that your dream of
winning Kshatripur will also be over.
Mura#You will not be able to kill me.
Mura#Because if you had to kill me
then you wouldn't get me here as maid
Mura#nor would you keep intact
the shield of my deceased husband?
Mura#I am the epitome of the
biggest war of your life.
Mura#The battle that you fought
to destroy the Kshatriya dignity.
Mura#I am that face of Kshatriya dignity
Mura#which you want always to see dejected.
Mura#I am that sight which when
bowed down gives you happiness.
Mura#You feel proud on seeing my condition.
Mura#Dhananand will never bring
an end to his happiness and pride.
Mura#Not even then
Mura#when that happiness will bring
insult for him in front of everyone.
Mura#Great! Very true. Very true.
Dhananand#You are right when you
say that I cannot kill you.
Dhananand#But I will kill the Kshatriya
dignity that is running inside you.
Dhananand#I will kill that pain
Dhananand#which reflects on your face
even after everything is finished.
Dhananand#Tomorrow morning you
will see such a scene
Dhananand#that will kill the Kshatrani in you.
Dhananand#Tomorrow morning the
entire Magadh will see
Dhananand#that how a person who
disrespects Magadh king
Dhananand#crosses the border of
life and gets closer to death.
Mura(V/O)#'My blessings are always with you,
Chandragupta.'
Male5#Bring everyone!
Female2#Have mercy on us! Let him go!
Female2#Believe me! My son did not steal it.
Female2#Let him go. Have mercy on us.
Female2#Let them go.
Our children are innocent!
Male3#My son is innocent, sire!
Male3#Let him go! Have mercy on us!
Male child2#Leave me. Let me go.
Male child2#I didn't do anything. Let me go.
Male child2#Leave me. Let me go.
Female3#Oh, God! Who knows who stole
the head of the king's statue.
Female3#Our children are paying the
price of someone else's crimes.
Chandragupta#Oh, God!
Chandragupta#So much cruelty to find the thief
Chandragupta#who stole the golden head!
Dhumketu#Chandra, tales of the king's
cruelty are known throughout Magadh.
Male4#Stop!
Male4#Where are you going?
Sthulabhadra#I am taking rations to our
soldiers posted on the borders.
Sthulabhadra#Do you want some?
Chorus#Let us go. Let us go.
Chorus#Let us go. Let us go.
Chorus#Let us go. Have mercy! Spare them.
Chorus#Let us go. Let us go.
Chorus#Let them go..
Chorus#Let them go. Spare them.
Chorus#Let them go. Let them go.

Rakshas#We have to take him alive and
present him in front of the Emperor!
Rakshas#Alive!

================================================================================

Episode: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NG0p56Q0KI

Stop!
Where are you headed?
I am taking rations and supplies
for our soldiers across the borders.
Do you want some?
Let them pass.
Oh God! We do not know who
took the head of the emperor's statue
and now our kids will
suffer for his crime!
Let me go! Let me go!
It is King Dhananand order
Till the theft is not being captured
till then everyone
will stay in the prison.
Have mercy! Have mercy!
No! I did no such thing!
Leave me! Let me go.
Run.. Run..
No.
You refuses to obey the king orders,
you fool!
Leave me! Let me go.
Take this chest and
go to our secret place.
I'll meet you there.
"Chandragupta! Chandragupta!"
Come on.
Who are you?
I am the one who teach
you a crucial lesson today!
The consequences you will face
for troubling a helpless innocent.
Take him along.
Two lashes and he
will learn his lesson.
Is that so? Two lashes, you say?
Friend!
Capture him!
We have to take him alive and present
him in front of the Emperor! Go!
I had told you all to leave!
- Why did you come back?
- We have learnt from you.
- Always be together!
- Always trust each other!
Formation!
Impossible!
How can a mere boy subdue them all?
You all must leave from here at
once before the reinforcements arrive!
Meet me at the designated spot!
- Now leave!
- Yes!
I do not know why I feel
that you were the one who took
the head of statue
on his name day.
Your wisdom. Your rule.
Your way of thinking.
Think of it whatever you want.
I have thought of it.
I am giving you an option.
Confess to your crime
or else prepare for your death.
I have always done what my heart said.
So why must I change
moments before my death?
So prepare to die!
Follow him!
I want him alive at any cost! Go!
Splendid!
Whoever you are..
You have come at the right time.
Councillor, we caught them
while they were on the run.
Put them in the dungeons.
Go.
This bracelet belongs to you, right?
Where did he go?
Indra!
Stulbhadra!
Dhumketu!
The chest is in place.
Where are those three?
Chandra! Chandra!
They have been taken by the army.
Indra, Stulbhadrav and Dhumketu..
All three of them have been captured
along with all the youth of Magadha.
The Emperor will spare no one! No one!
Tell me, who that young boy was.
I very well know that he has stolen
the king's crown that is his pride.
Answer me.
You will get tired of thrashing me
but we will never tell his name.
Will you never tell me?
- Tell me.
- Councillor Rakshas, stop!
Greetings, Lady.
I may have raised Dhananand
but I love him a lot.
And I admit that he is
a tyrant crowned as the Emperor!
What heartless man will
ever punish kids in such a manner?
Yes..
They have been put
in dungeons like animals!
This is wrong.
You are no less of a criminal,
Rakshas.
Rather than easing Dhananand's rage
you simply fuel it being his yes man.
But I am here now
and you are not needed here.
Then I must relay this
to the Emperor.
Rakshas, you know this well
that I will not stop you.
And you cannot stop me.
Allow me to leave.
Move.
Come with me.
We do not have much time
before Councillor
Rakshas meets Dhananand.
Come with me! Come on!
What are you thinking, Chandra?
If I listen to Lubdhak
and have this head melted
and defy Dhananand then tyrant
Dhananand will have my friends killed
and thousands other along with them.
And if I go against Lubdhak
and send this head to Dhananand
then I will never be able
to meet mother again.
Move faster, kids.
We do not have much time.
You were the Emperor's nursemaid
so why do you help us?
I had a hand to play
in the existence of Dhananand.
I cannot stop his madness
but I can try to
stop the harm it causes.
So that the burden
of my guilt is lessened.
Come with me now. Make haste!
Move! Faster!
Take these steeds and
go far away from Magadha.
But who will use this fourth steed..
This one is for your friend.
It is for him.
If he stays here in Pataliputra
then the Emperor will
find him and have him killed.
And I do not want that to happen.
Tell me, where does he live?
hat is his name?
I will inform him
so that you four can leave
far from here and be safe!
Splendid! Splendid!
My dear. It will be great
if I am able to save him as well.
Tell me, what is his name?
Where does he live? Tell me.
His name..
- His name is.. - Do not tell her
the name of your friend.
Guards!
Get this handmaiden!
Do you now see her true form?
She is not just a mere nursemaid
that raised the Emperor but she
is his accomplice in all heinous acts.
She was only pretending to free you
so that you tell her about your friend
and she gets to present him along
with you right in front of Dhananand.
Do not tell her of his name!
Capture these three
and put them back in the dungeons!
No!
The darkness of the night
will be eternal for you.
Tomorrow at the first light
your corpses will fall on the ground.
Mura, you have done a terrible deed.
Your insolence has crossed the line.
And you walked all the way
here using these feet of yours.
Scream!
Scream as much as you can.
Scream in such a way that
it becomes your reminiscence.
And every moment
you remember the moment
when you dared to stand
against the nanny of Dhananand.
On guard!
Lord Dhananand,
ruler of Magadha enters the court!
Have mercy, sire. Have mercy!
Have mercy, sire. Have mercy!
Have mercy, sire.
I feel exquisite joy when I hear
someone begging for their life,
trembling in fear.
And this joy will be elated times fold
when that proud lady of
the warrior clan comes to me.
Where is Mura?
Now things seem to brighten up.
Forgive me, people of Magadha.
That you all had to come
here at the break of dawn.
But I had no choice.
I had to send a message
to all of Magadha.
And this is my message.
That I, Dhananand, the sun of Magadha
hold the Sun as a
witness and swear an oath
that if the one who has stolen
the golden head of my statue
does not come forth
and confess his crimes
then I will kill all
the lads present here.
They will not live to see the sunset.
You did laugh out loud
seeing my statue yesterday.
And now you shall see how
this court of Magadha will be adorned
with the severed heads of young boys!
Wait for the sun to rise!
Let us begin from the ones
who knew who the thief was!
No! No!
No! Sthulbhadra! Sthul.. Sthul..
'Dear God!'
'When will the wait of people
who suffer, come to an end?'
'When will the saviour arrive who will
stand against the tyrant Dhananand!'
"Chandragupta!"
"He attacks his enemies.
Chandragupta!"
"His sight is as sharp as a blade.
Chandragupta!"
"Chandragupta Maurya!
Chandragupta Maurya!"
"Chandragupta Maurya!
Chandragupta Maurya!"
"Chandragupta Maurya! Chandragupta!"
You might be more pleased
to see this head right here
rather than these heads.
Who are you?
He is the one, my Lord.
One that stole the
head of your statue.
He is a thief!

================================================================================

Episode: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QZSS20S4To

Let us begin with the ones
who know the thief!
No! No!
No! Sthulbhadra! Sthul.. Sthul..
'Dear God!'
'When will the wait of people
who suffer, come to an end?'
'When will the saviour arrive who will
stand against the tyrant Dhananand!'
"Chandragupta! Chandragupta!"
"He attacks his enemies!
Chandragupta!"
"His sight is as sharp as a blade.
Chandragupta!"
"He is a warrior, but patient.
He is the pride of his clan."
"He is cultured, intelligent.
He is as bright as the sun."
"He is Chandragupta Maurya!"
"He is Chandragupta Maurya!"
"Chandragupta Maurya!
Chandragupta Maurya!"
"Chandragupta Maurya!"
"Chandragupta Maurya! Chandragupta!"
You might be more pleased
to see this head right here
rather than these heads.
Who are you?
He is the one, my Lord.
One that stole the
head of your statue.
He is the one that
defied your command.
Of all the young boys
that we had captured
he had freed many of them.
He is a rebel! Thief!
Then you are very fortunate,
Councillor.
For you have met a strange thief
that first steals the gold
and then comes back to
the court to give it back.
My Lord, Councillor's statement
is not completely without merit.
I am a thief.
I have stolen this golden head.
But I stole from the ones
that were escaping with it.
And as far as goes for
defying your command so I did it
to save Magadha's honour.
Since I saw those thieves running away
and I knew that the young
boys who were being captured
were at no fault in this.
And if this news were to break out
that the Lord of Magadha
killed the youth of
his Kingdom merely on a whim
then it would bring great dishonour to Land of Magadha.
And I could not stand by that!
Your lies are futile.
You are not here to
save the honour of Magadha.
You are here to save your friends.
Look over here!
I remember them well.
You are quite amusing, Councillor.
You just called me cunning
and now you paint me as a fool.
Pray tell me.
What wise man would
put his own life at peril
just to save his friends?
Every creature in Magadha knows
that after committing a crime
if one comes to Lord Dhananand
then only death awaits him.
Now tell me.
Why will a wise man
act in such a manner?
I came here as a
good civilian of Magadha
as I knew
that many innocent boys will be killed
in a shadow of doubt
for this golden head.
Quite a fancy tale but
it does have another side, lad.
You have come here since your
foolish master did undertake the heist
but once..
But once he knew
of the punishment that
follows this act of greed
he sent you ahead to avert his fate.
He may not even know
what he has stolen
but once he knew what he has done
he was forced to turn it back.
Am I right?
'Dear God! This man is
not just evil but very cunning.'
No, do not be startled.
Slave.
Shackles in one's
feet make things evident.
'Now that you have
decided to stay back'
'then you will put
on these shackles, slave.'
So tell me.
Who is your master?
My Master..
'If you speak of my
name to Emperor Dhananand'
'then you will never
find out about your mother.'
Answer the Lord.
Why are you quiet?
Speak forth.
Who is your master?
My Master is innocent and so am I.
We did not steal this golden head.
You came here for your friends
and you are trying
to keep your master safe.
It is indeed a brave act but now
your statements are annoying me.
Kill him at once.
'Who made you do all this?'
'His face was veiled.'
'I only saw the ring
with royal seal on his hand.'
It seems that fear of
death has made you insane.
You laugh when you must be crying!
Councillor.
Now you are simply
hearing me laugh but soon
the world will be laughing
at Magadha and the Emperor.
In the marketplace, on the river banks
and in the schools,
people will speak of this tale
that even when being
so close to the thief
the emperor could not identify him.
If you kill me today
the thief will be elated with joy
and he will boast high
of how he fooled a mighty Emperor.
He will laugh out loud
when he remembers this act
and he will make the
world laugh along with him.
You are saying that
you are not the thief.
Then who is it?
A thief is not the one
who steals by his own hands.
A true culprit is the
one that plans the heist.
And the master of such prowess
is here in the court
who is given a royal honour.
When I was laying a trap in the
forest as my master had commanded me
I saw some people digging
a ditch in the forest.
They were hiding this
chest in that ditch.
When I challenged them
they ran away from there.
I could not see their faces.
But I saw a ring
on the hand of one thief
that had the royal seal on it.
Fool!
These rings were given as gifts
by the Emperor Dhananand
to us all seven brothers.
There are no other such
rings apart from these.
So it means
that you are accusing us.
'Seven brothers who
wear identical rings!'
'I am doomed.'
My Lord,
this lad is sent by our enemies.
One that wishes
to sow doubt and hatred
amongst us brothers
and to break apart our family!
He wishes to break apart Magadha!
Often we fail to the
see the enemy who lurks closer
and remain fixated on
the one that is far away.
While in truth
the peril lies closer.
If any word of what you
said turns out to be a lie
then I will not simply kill you.
I will coat your body with honey
and I will bury you
half in the orchard.
And then I will sip wine
and watch as your death
crawls closer to you.
The honey will attract the ants
and then they will eat you.
Your skin gets devoured first
and then they reach your flesh.
Followed by your bones.
You will die every moment
while being alive to suffer.
Your body will satiate
the ants and that scene
will please my eyes.
So if you wish to live, kid then tell
who is the culprit
and you have to prove it.
I can accuse anyone but to prove it..
How will I prove it?
Indeed. I will prove it.
But first you must free my hands,
my Lord.
'He stares at me as if he will devour
me whole if I fail to prove it.'
'Is he a ruler or a beast?'
Lubdhak.
Lubdhak!
It seems he is not at home.
We have searched all the city
and he is only slave trader
one that we did not
ask about that boy.
Let us speak to the others.
Listen to me, kind one.
I wish to meet Lubdhak
but it seems he is not at home.
I am a trader of bear hide.
I heard he pays well.
What?
In some time he will be
seen begging on the streets.
As all his slaves
will be killed today.
Where is he?
He must be at the palace.
To see his own doom.
Bhairav, that boy is
the saviour of this land.
His life is very precious.
We have to save him at any cost.
Do not waste the Lord's time!
Tell us who is the traitor
or else prepare for your death!
Councillor.
It is not the theft
of a hen that we speak of.
The great head of a statue
of the great emperor was stolen.
Give me some time.
Forgive me, my Emperor.
I could not hear you.
This councillor of
yours interrupted us.
Forgive me.
Brother, I fail to see
why we are simply watching
this fool as he keeps
talking to this golden head?
- Why?
- What are you saying?
This is no simple head.
It's the head of Lord Dhananand,
Lord Of Magadha
and the idol of a God
is treated with respect.
Do you want me to mock it?
Brother, I did not mean that.
It is the faith in one's heart
that give the devotee
the power to see his Lord.
Seven people with seven rings
and I do not know who the thief is.
I am no sorcerer to present
an evidence in an empty fist.
I have been told.
The statue's head has told me of it.
Who that culprit is!
I found it.
The one who stole this head left
a belonging of his own in this chest.
Now this will tell the Emperor
of the criminal who did it.
The one brother who is the traitor.
Bring it here.
He is lying!
I was nowhere near the chest.
And I did not even go
there after the theft so how..
How can I drop anything in that chest?
This was the evidence.
A breadcrumb.
One that was left in
the beard of the thief.
Now the criminal stands before you.
And he has confessed his crime.
Thrash him 10 times for one chapatti.
Not to him but to me.
If the king is not able to
satisfy the hunger of his people
then the king is at
fault and not the people.
- Hail Lord Chandragupta!
- Hail!

================================================================================

Episode: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svhmXhyBjOQ

'Here is the proof, Your Highness.'
He is lying!
I did not even go close to the safe.
I did not even go there
when this theft took place.
Then how can my belonging be there?
This was that thing.
A small particle.
This is enough to prove his crime.
Your Highness, he is the thief..
I will behead him right now.
I knew that you were greedy.
But you stole the gift
that you'd given to me?
Why, Brother?
Forgive me, Brother.
It took me one year
to make that sword.
But it was also important
for me to gift it to you.
So that you regard me highly.
I thought of gifting
it to you before everyone
and then stealing it to get
back the money I deserve for it.
I know that my crime is unforgivable.
But I am your elder brother.
Will you not forgive me?
Move!
Brother
you do not need to tell me
what you mean for me.
Midwife, do you remember this?
I held his finger and learned to walk.
These are the hands
which fed me numerous times.
I learned to use weapons from him.
Whenever I was about to fall
he held my hand saved me.
You are
a father figure for me.
Brother, thank you for forgiving me.
You are my younger brother.
But today,
your compassion has proven that
you are better than me even in values.
No, Brother.
It is better if you hold
the status of my elder brother.
I will always be younger
to you in everything.
No.
I will never change for you.
Not even today.
What are you waiting for, guards?
Take him to the royal
vaid immediately.
People of Magadha
look at the justice of your emperor.
No matter how big or small a crime is
no criminal in Magadha
deserves forgiveness.
Not even my elder brother.
There are still some
people in this court
who are unaware of
my power and status.
They are making a mistake.
I hope they mend their ways.
Because nobody can get away
from the my eyes.
What do you want as a reward
for this amazing job, child?
Your one act of justice
has spread fear in everyone.
Now please do one more thing
which will make the people hail you.
Release these innocent prisoners,
Your Highness.
'Why am I feeling that he is my son?'
Servant?
When a person talks too much before me
I chop his tongue with the same axe.
But you have safeguarded my respect.
I will surely fulfill your desire.
Go, free them yourself.
Go for it.
Thank you, Your Highness!
'Chandragupta, is that you?'
'Yes, it is him. He is my son.'
No, Father. Do not do this.
Why should I be silent?
Just because he is a king
he cannot oppress the innocent.
Mister, this is not
the time to protest.
Take your son along and go home
before the emperor changes his mind.
No.
I will make sure I say
what is in my heart.
King Dhananand!
All hail!
- All hail King Dhananand!
- Hail!
- All hail King Dhananand!
- Hail!
- All hail King Dhananand!
- Hail!
- All hail King Dhananand!
- Hail!
- All hail King Dhananand!
- Hail!
- All hail King Dhananand!
- Hail!
- All hail King Dhananand!
- Hail!
- All hail King Dhananand!
- Hail!
- All hail King Dhananand!
- Hail!
This kid seems to be special,
Bhadrasaal.
He knows to put forward his opinion
as well as he knows
to please the emperor too.
Bring him to my cabin.
- All hail King Dhananand!
- Hail!
- All hail King Dhananand!
- Hail!
'The person who can praise the evil
Dhananand can't be related to me.'
Chandragupta, today you've
proven that you are not a human.
- You're God's incarnation.
- Yes.
Whom are you searching for,
Chandragupta?
Lubdhak!
Today, he will have to
reveal the identity of my mother.
Lubdhak, wait!
What happened now?
Both the thief and his
theft have been exposed.
And even the emperor has set me free.
Let me leave now.
I am here to show you the way.
The emperor wants to meet you.
That is great!
Even I will invite him one day.
And then we will sit in
the garden and praise its beauty.
But now I have got
an important task to do.
Let me leave.
No one can disregard
the emperor's orders.
'Dhananand, this is the last time'
'that you will be a hurdle
in my search for mother.'
That kid freed all the adults
who were taken captive by Dhananand.
Acharya, that kid freed all the adults
who were taken as
captive by Dhananand.
Perhaps
a moon has appeared
by itself to protect Magadha
from the heat of the
sun called Dhananand.
Why do say perhaps, Acharya?
Because I am still not
sure about my thoughts, Bhairav.
I agree that,
that kid possess amazing skills.
He is witty. He is brave.
But in order to make
me believe that he is suitable
to become the emperor
of Magadha, he will
have to go through a few more tests.
Then, are we risking
our lives for somebody
about whom, you are still not sure?
Bhairav, it is not only
a quest to find an eligible kid.
The quest is to find that emperor
who will bear the burden
of the future of Bharat.
That is such an amazing fragrance.
Tell me something.
Your emperor seems
to be very thin and lean.
Then how does he
manage to eat so much?
There must be some left overs.
What do you do with that?
This food is not for the emperor.
It is for his dogs.
Dogs?
This..
This sword and armour
belongs to Piplivaan's king.
He dared to raise his
voice against the emperor.
And if you do not move from here
then I will kill
you with the same sword.
Piplivaan..
That sounds familiar.
You!
Hey, you! Do not dare to move from
your place till the emperor arrives.
Sir, why do you turn
so furious over everything?
The ruler of Magadha,
Emperor Dhananand is on his way!
Your hair is very beautiful.
If you are fortunate enough
I might style your
hair with my own hands.
No, my King..
I love my long and dense hair.
If you really want
to do someone's hair
then you should cut
the hair of my friend here.
He is very hot-headed.
Indeed.. You are very different.
I am impressed with you.
So, tell me. What is your name?
I am a slave,
my King, and slaves don't have names.
What if I free you
from this life of slavery?
What if I give you a chance
to serve me inside the palace?
'Chandra, if you go away you'll
never find out where your mother is.'
I don't think that this
will be appropriate, my King.
- You..
- What I meant so say
you will be awarding a life of slavery
to a person who's already a slave.
Then what will people think
of your greatness, my King?
What will people say?
They might say that the
king of Magadha has a small heart.
I can't accept that.
You are right.
So, what do you want?
My King, you are pleased with
me and I don't want anything else.
Your king is pleased and that
is why he wishes to reward you, kid!
Now that I have decided it
you can be certain that
I'll definitely reward you.
Now it is up to you to
decide if you want a reward
or a death sentence.
The kid's courage
vanished in thin air.
Now tell me
what do you want?
My King,
I will tell you about my decision
but can you kindly tell me
why they replaced your throne?
Alcohol got spilled on that throne
that's why it was replaced
with another throne.
T-Then what will happen to the throne
that they just took away from here?
No one else apart from the
king can sit on a king's throne, kid.
So tell me now,
what do you want to be rewarded with?
My King, I want to stay
in this palace.
But I don't want
to stay here as a slave.
I want to live like a prince
only for one day.
I want to experience the joys
and luxuries of your royal lifestyle.
Lock this slave in the dungeon.
Wait!
I give it to you.
I give you the chance to
live like a prince for one day.
You have pleased
me immensely as a slave
and so I am sure that you will
please me even more as a prince.
- King Dhananand..
- Long live..
- King Dhananand..
- Long live..
- King Dhananand..
- Long live..
- King Chandragupta..
- Long live..
- King Chandragupta..
- Long live..
- King Chandragupta..
- Long live..
What is all this?
You are about to become a prince
and now you've to show
us how you'll deliver justice.
I am not interested
in all these things.
I want to find out about
my mother from Lubdhak.
But Kumbh has gone
to look for Lupdutt.
And in the meantime
you must show us how you'll
exercise your duties as a king.
Attention! The head of Magadha
the brave warrior king
of Magadha is coming!
- Chandragupta, King of Magadha..
- Long live..
- Chandragupta, King of Magadha..
- Long live..
- Chandragupta, King of Magadha..
- Long live..
- Chandragupta, King of Magadha..
- Long live..
- Chandragupta, King of Magadha..

- Chandragupta, King of Magadha..
- Long live..
- Chandragupta, King of Magadha..
- Long live..
- Chandragupta, King of Magadha..
- Long live..
- Chandragupta, King of Magadha..
- Long live..
"Chandragupta Maurya.."
"Chandragupta Maurya.."
"Chandragupta Maurya.."
"Chandragupta Maurya.."
- Chandragupta, King of Magadha..
- Long live..
- Chandragupta, King of Magadha..
- Long live..
- Chandragupta, King of Magadha..
- Long live..
- Chandragupta, King of Magadha..
- Long live..
- Chandragupta, King of Magadha..
- Long live..
- Chandragupta, King of Magadha..
- Long live..
- Chandragupta, King of Magadha..
- Long live..
- Chandragupta, King of Magadha..
- Long live..
- Chandragupta, King of Magadha..
- Long live..
- Chandragupta, King of Magadha..
- Long live..
"Chandragupta Maurya.."
Thrash him 10 times for one chapatti.
Not to him but to me.
If the king is not able to
satisfy the hunger of his people
then the king is at
fault and not the people.
- King Chandragupta..
- Long live..

================================================================================

Episode: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEv_lS1oo3s

- Hail King Chandragupta!
- Hail!
- Hail King Chandragupta!
- Hail!
- Hail King Chandragupta!
- Hail!
- Hail King Chandragupta!
- Hail!
- Hail King Chandragupta!
- Hail!
- Hail King Chandragupta!
- Hail!
- Hail King Chandragupta!
- Hail!
- Hail King Chandragupta!
- Hail!
The assembly of the great
king Chandragupta is commencing now.
All your troubles will
be taken into account and solved.
Long live the king.
Two subjects will be presented.
They are neighbours
who ended up having a fight.
Come forward for justice.
Great king, please do justice.
My neighbour had a well
which he sold it to me.
But he still takes water from it.
He does not let me take
out water from the well.
Is this true?
King, I only sold him the well
but not the water in it.
In a way,
I have the right to that well, King.
What he is saying is right in a way.
You sold him the well
and not the water in it.
So you have the right to
take the water from the well.
But you don't have
the right to use the well.
Either
empty the well by taking
out every drop of water from it
or pay a rent every month
to keep your water in it.
- But, King..
- Till now..
Till now this kingdom
was witnessing injustice
but from now on
in the land of King Chandragupta
the rules and regulations
will be amended
and justice will also prevail.
Wonderful! Wonderful, King!
- Hail King Chandragupta!
- Hail!
- Hail King Chandragupta!
- Hail!
- Hail King Chandragupta!
- Hail!
- Hail King Chandragupta!
- Hail!
Acharya, we should not waste time.
- The soldiers are after us.
- And the future is in front of us.
- Hail King Chandragupta!
- Hail!
- Hail King Chandragupta!
- Hail!
Bhairav, as planned,
do not let the soldiers come here.
I have to go.
- Hail King Chandragupta!
- Hail!
- Hail King Chandragupta!
- Hail!
- Hail King Chandragupta!
- Hail!
Bring forward the next case.
Give alms to a monk like me, King.
"Chanakya! Chanakya! Chanakya!"
"Chanakya! Chanakya! Chanakya!"
Respected monk,
there is a misunderstanding.
He is not a real king.
Neither is this assembly real.
- We are playing our part here.
- Yes.
Politics is not to be
mocked nor is it a game, King.
Moreover,
everybody is given the opportunity
to voice his concern to the King.
Rightly said.
Go ahead and ask me. What do you want?
To meet the daily
necessities of my people
and to carry on with my veneration
I need the five necessary ingredients.
The milk of a cow, Ghee, yoghurt
cow urine and cow dung.
If a poor monk like me has a cow
then all my needs will be met, King.
Minister.
Out of those cows
whichever the monk wants,
give one to him.
Wait.
King..
Neither will I be able
to pay the price for this cow
nor will I be able to pay any tax.
Still you are going
ahead and giving me a cow.
If you go on giving
everything for charity
then the state coffers
will go bankrupt.
Monk, neither am
I sympathising with you
nor am I giving it
away to you as charity.
By your veneration
if you are not able to please
the Gods, then this kingdom of mine
will be deprived of
prosperity and peace..
The kingdom will be deprived of rain.
And if there is no rain
then there will be no harvest..
If there is no harvest
then the farmers will
not have any money..
That money, which is the source
of prosperity of this kingdom.
Trade will not flourish.
And if that happens
then I will not get any tax.
If my kingdom does not get any tax
then the state coffers will be empty.
Without wealth
I will not be able to
meet the expense of my army.
And a kingdom without an army
will be a sitting
duck for the enemies.
And when there will be no
kingdom then who am I to be a king?
Get it?
By giving this cow to you for free
I am doing a favour
to myself and not you, monk.
Because I believe
if the kingdom needs a change
then first,
we have to change our perception.
Widen it.
'When a person's value improves
his thoughts get better too.'
'But I must say this
with great regret Dhananand.'
'Your personality did grow'
'but your mind remained
to be utterly narrow.'
'Darn such a thought!'
You are right.
For the benefit of the nation
the thoughts of the
king are the most important.
- Hail Emperor Chandragupta!
- Hail be to him!
- Hail Emperor Chandragupta!
- Hail be to him!
- Hail Emperor Chandragupta!
- Hail be to him!
My search ends here.
What kind of search, Brahmin.
'The soil particle
you have compared me with'
'with that same soil
I shall create a new emperor.'
Search of that mentality
which shall redeem not just
Magadh but the entire Bharat.
The gem I came here searching
for I found it today.
Then take care of your gem, Brahmin.
This is Magadh.
Even Emperor Dhananand's
wealth is not safe here
forget about yours.
'Until I fulfill this oath of mine'
'till then I shall
not tie this lock of mine.'
I do not know about Dhananand
but
one of your precious
thing is safe with me.
Chandra!
Lubdhak has been found.
He did not even thank you.
Unruly boy!
Call him the future emperor, Bhairav.
I do not have a doubt anymore.
He has the knowledge
of politics and justice
and is alert as well.
He understood immediately
that I came here with a goal.
He is the future of Bharat.
"Chandragupta!"
"Chandragupta!"
Capable of leading.
Clever politician.
A fearless one.
Wise and deliverer of justice.
"He is an attack on the enemy..
Chandragupta!"
Chandragupta is..
that rising Moon of future
over the dark present of Bharat.
"He is brave, stands his ground,
founder of dynasty.."
- Chandragupta shall be..
- "As bright as the Sun."
The future Emperor of Bharat.
"That is Chandragupta Maurya!
"Chandragupta!"
'The emperor wants to meet you.'
I shall not let you interfere
once again in my mission
to get information on my mother.
That slave is a fool.
But you are a captain
of Magadh's army.
It is not right if you
work being drunk like this.
Watch your tongue, Hunter.
I am not drunk.
His Majesty has himself invited that
slave to become a prince for a day.
But he.. He has fled.
Please ask for forgiveness
to His Majesty on his behalf.
You see, he does not go
anywhere if he does not want to.
I had told you.
He is brainless.
It will be better if he does not return
to Pataliputra in the first place.
He has invited death by
disobeying His Majesty's order.
- Tell me where he is!
- I don't know.
- Speak!
- I don't know.
Nowhere. And not at all
till you tell me where my mother is.
Tell me where my mother is.
- I heard that boy was gallant.
- Yes, he was brave.
Oh, Lord!
Everybody is praising that boy
who found and returned
the king's golden head.
Mura..
Even you were there.
What is your opinion?
- 'Hail King Dhananand!
- Hail!'
- 'Hail King Dhananand!
- Hail!'
- 'Hail King Dhananand!
- Hail!'
- 'Hail King Dhananand!
- Hail!'
- 'Hail King Dhananand!
- Hail!'
- 'Hail King Dhananand!
- Hail!'
I do not think he
has done any great task.
What he did was to save his own life.
I am not moved by what he did.
Of course.
After all you are the
former queen of Piplivan.
Small incidents will not affect you.
For a common woman like me,
this is a big news.
Whose dress is this in your sack?
This seems to be the dress of a boy.
But there is no boy of
this age in the royal palace.
The stitching..
Even the stitching
is not of a tailor who stitches
the dresses of the royal family.
No..
It is definitely tailored.
I will be right back.
Tell me where is my mother?
You feel you are very powerful.
Why are you wasting
it for her who has left you?
Listen to me and stay with me.
I shall make you head of slaves.
Tell me, is this the
answer to my question?
Stop!
What do you think you are doing?
I am burning down this place!
Do not burn my house!
Tomorrow there will
be news in Magadh that you..
You were burnt to death.
No!
The king would have
punished you to death
if I had told him the truth
that it was you who had
stolen the golden head.
But I refrained from telling him that
because I wanted you to be alive..
So that you could give
me details of my mother.
But now, I do not think
that you should stay alive.
Chandra.. Chandra, stop.
Maybe he does not know anything.
He knows everything and
he will tell me everything.
No!
Lubdhak,
if you do not tell me the truth
then your house will be on fire.
Stop!
I will tell you everything.
The news was doing
the rounds that she..
She is in the royal palace.
What!
- In the royal palace?
- Yes.
The king thought that
her beauty will go in vain.
The king gave her the benefits
of money and jewellery.
So that she stays with him.
Lady, I saw a dress of
a 16 year old boy with Mura.
From now on,
you will be my supreme handmaid.
This is your reward
for giving the information.
I will not give you a chance
to complain, Your Highness.
Okay.
This is the right
step towards my goal.
She is staying like
a queen at the royal palace
with all the wealth and grandeur.
And I have heard this.
You are lying!
Why would I lie?
She had even abandoned you for wealth.
For wealth, she accepted Dhananand.
There is no reason
to be surprised, Chandra.
You!
Why are you punishing me
for the misdeeds of your mother?
Instead of accepting you she
chose a life of luxury and peace.
Why should I be blamed for it?
If you are lying
and if I do not find
her in the royal palace
then start counting your days!
Where do you think you are going?
To accept the reward
from King Dhananand..
To accept the invitation
to become a prince for a day..
And also to find my mother.
'With this half-baked truth'
'you will not be able
to reach out to your mother'
'in that massive palace, Chandra.'
'When the zest in you will
end in search of your mother'
'then you will come back to me'
'and become my slave again, forever.'
Her son is alive!
Where is the prince of Piplivan?
Chandragupta has invited trouble
by deciding to go to the palace.
My son does not fear you.
He will surely come.
He shall burn you all down to ashes.

================================================================================

Episode: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFDNGvd0_t4

Splendid!
I had no idea she
is so good at stitching.
Dhananand, you are unbelievable!
Come on, Lady.
You consider me so mean to expect
me not to appreciate pure talent.
Of course you should.
Leave me! Let me go.
What did I do? Just let me go.
Do you recognise this robe?
Years ago, you mourned for 13 days
upon the death of your son.
Do you remember?
You had donated all
his clothes and toys.
But look what I found today.
A robe stitched by you
for your dead son!
Had he been alive,
he would have been..
16 years old!
Yes!
Only a crazy woman would
do that for her dead son.
And you are not crazy.
That means your son is not dead.
This implies
all these years,
you kept us in the dark
and lied to us.
Everyone knows
that my son is dead.
So adamant, you are!
Whose robe is this then?
You are creating a scene.
I have no information on this.
Finding an unidentified
robe in the palace
is either bad omen or a conspiracy.
Maitri!
Ask the soldiers to
drag her to the kitchen.
Yesterday, her legs were burnt.
But today I will burn the
very hands that stitched this robe.
No..
No.. No!
Such violence!
Torturing a helpless, troubled woman..
No, this is not right.
For something that she claims
does not belong to her son.
He is dead!
Am I right?
This robe is the root
of all our problems.
Soldier!
If there would be no robe
- there will be no suspicion.
- No.. No..
Let it go.. Do not burn it, please.
Please stop, do not burn it.
Let me go.
Lady, when I was little
you would tell me that story..
Yes.. About Holika!
That Holika was burnt
and Pralad survived
and Pralad represented the truth.
The robe was burnt
and the truth is right before us.
Her son is alive!
But..
Where is the prince of Piplivan?
I do not know.
I have not seen him in 12 years.
I am unaware of where
he is or what he is up to.
So many questions.. Such worries!
While I am here?
No.. No!
It is the job of
the king to find answers
to the questions of his subjects.
I cannot see you in this state.
I will find your son
and I will make sure I finish
your troubles I mean, your son!
This will be the punishment
for the sins of lies and deceit
that you committed all these years.
Your son will pay for your crimes.
When you find the
ashes of your dead son
put the ashes of this robe on him.
Do not worry, Dhananand.
A king like you can
quickly find a child.
Soon, he will be before you.
Your Highness, that boy
rejected your offer of
being the prince for a day.
He ran away because he is fearless.
Just as the child was not intimidated
by your power and position
similarly, my son will not fear you.
But he will not run away.
He will come.
He will certainly come, Dhananand.
He shall burn you all down to ashes.
Hey, did you not hear
a handmaiden challenge me?
I want that boy here.
He will surely be the prince for a day
as I commanded.
And put her in the darkest dungeon.
No food or water for her!
You all have seen that boy.
Everyone in Patliputra has seen him
and hence, spread across the region
and find that boy. Bring him here!
That will not be necessary.
Pardon me, Sire.
I got a little scared seeing
the glory of this royal palace.
But later I thought
that this would be
disrespectful to the King.
And thus
I accept the King's offer.
I will be the prince
of Magadha for a day.
He destroyed all our things
by sprinkling oil on it.
Let that boy come here.
I will make sure I skin
him alive and punish him to death.
I, Lubdhak, give my word.
I will pay for all this, Lubdhak.
You seem like a trader
and you are trading here as well,
it seems.
Well.. What do you want in exchange
of paying for this loss?
Walk away.
Not much, I just need information
about that boy Chandragupta.
Chandragupta?
I do not want to talk about him.
He is a snake, a cheater.
He is a liar,
someone you can never trust.
It is impossible to control him.
I understand
but had it been impossible,
why would he still be with you?
Why does he not run away?
Why is he your slave?
He is not my slave.
He is with me because of
his hatred towards his mother.
And that is what is
keeping him close to me.
Hatred? But he always
has his mother's bangle on him.
You look wise but perhaps
you do not understand
that hatred houses more in the heart,
than love.
That bangle is with him
to remind him of his
revenge from his mother.
A mother who sold
him away for a few coins.
Hatred can overshadow
a person's wisdom.
And the proof of that is Chandragupta.
'Lubdhak,
if you do not tell me the truth'
'I will burn everything down.'
'Fine, I will tell you!'
'She is in the palace.'
He is headed to the palace,
looking for his mother.
What!
Why the palace?
How will he find her there?
He can bank on anything. He had learnt
that King Dhananand holds
his mother in high regard
and that imbecile
is headed to the palace.
I wonder what nuisance
he will create there.
'Chandragupta is in trouble now.'
Greetings, Brother.
I have instructed some Brahmins
to conduct a veneration
for your better health.
These flowers are for the same.
These flowers cannot bring me peace.
Neither can venerations..
I will find peace by vengeance.
Have you gone crazy, Brother?
First, you dared to steal
the golden head of the King.
You lost your finger.
And that is not enough
for you to control
your desire for vengeance.
Consider that I did not hear
that because I do not support it.
I want vengeance
but not from Dhananand.
I seek revenge from that boy.
The one because of
whom I lost my finger.
'This is the proof of the theft,
Your Highness.'
Because of him, I lost my honour
and my finger.
I have heard that the
King has invited the boy
to live in the palace for a day.
You did hear that, did you not?
And thus I want the
two of us to join hands
and make that one day, his final day.
I want to finish the boy.
Will you not do that
for your elder brother?
I am aware that finding your
mother is the goal of your life.
But looking for her in
the palace can be dangerous.
Your mother might not even be there
and they might find the
true reason for you going there.
- Then what?
- What if she is there?
I do not want to
miss this opportunity.
I will certainly go to the palace.
You will surely come, Chandra.
You will cross
all hurdles and troubles in your way.
You will surely come.
You will certainly come, son.
What now, Acharya?
We will protect the future king.
Chandragupta has invited trouble
by deciding to go to the palace.
I must get him out of there
at any cost.
'What will you do
if you find your mother?'
'I will forbid her from
calling herself my mother.'
'I will reveal her
true self and ask her'
'that if she had to
sell me off to be a slave'
'then why did she give birth to me?'
'Will you humiliate your
mother in front of the court?'
- 'That is not how you are.
- That is what she deserves.'
'I will do everything'
'that hurts her'
'because I have seen
enough pain in my childhood.'
'She sold me off, her own son'
'for a few coins.'
'She must pay a price
for my lost childhood.'
'That is a huge palace, Chandra.'
'So large that it might take
weeks to tour the entire place.'
'Thousands of people live there.'
'How will you find
your mother in a day?'
'According to Lubdhak,
she is no ordinary woman'
'but one who is admired by the King.'
'And she is treated as a queen.'
'So it should not be
difficult to find her.'
'You do not know how she looks.'
'And even if she appears before you'
'how will you recognise her?'
'How will you execute your
plan in the King's presence?'
'I am assuming'
'that the King will
be watching me like a hawk'
'and will ensure that
I am always near him'
'but I will change
the circumstances in a way'
'that he will present her before me.'
'Think well before you go, Chandra.'
'This can be challenging.'
When the result is so important
one must face the challenges.
I am ready to face any hurdles
to finally end my
wait of all these years.
I am coming, Mother
to repay you.
Not destiny but his cleverness
made him Prince for one day.
Stop Chandragupta.
Death is certain in this palace.
Who can elude something
that is certain?
The life of stubborn
disciple is in danger.
How will Master Chanakya
save his life?

================================================================================

Episode: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naSu2nc4yTo

I am ready to take up any challenge
in order to end an age old problem.
Mother, I am coming
to seek my revenge.
Bhadrasaal, bring the gift that I have
brought for this snobbish warrior.
Sure, Mother.
Do you know this ash?
This is the ash of
the people of Peeplivan
who had rejected
the rule of Dhananand.
The heads which did
not bow down to Dhanand
and were burnt.
Our dear sister,
Durdhara is returning as new.
After returning,
when she asks about your finger
what will you tell my sister, Brother?
I will tell her that
my hand got injured
during the chase.
Very good!
It is an excuse as well as the truth.
After all, this incident took
place while protecting my treasure.
Entire Magadha bows down to me.
But I bow down to my sister's wishes.
I have taken care of her just
how the petals handle the dew drops.
Say anything that you want.
But remember one thing.
My sister
should not be upset
knowing that her brother tried
to steal the treasure of the king.
Do you agree with me, brother?
- Do you agree with me, brother? Right?
Yes. I agree.
Forget your misunderstandings and
give a hug to your younger brother.
Come.
You had thrown the same
ash on the king of Magadha, right?
Now, the same ash will
destroy your identity.
Very soon..
Very soon, your son's ash
will get mixed with it.
Dhananand just needs to find him.
Be alert!
Peeplivan's prince is arriving.
Be alert!
Peeplivan's prince is arriving.
Peeplivan's prince? This means
Mura's son.
If Peeplivan's prince is your son
you will see him turning
into ash today itself.
Free her.
Chandra.
Several years ago this
sword had killed the father.
Now, the same sword will kill the son.
Be alert.
Peeplivan's prince is arriving.
Hail King Dhananand!
Hail King Dhananand!
Peeplivan's prince.
Peeplivan's prince.
Peeplivan's..
Today will be the
last day of this servant.
Peeplivan's prince.
Why didn't I think about this earlier?
When entire Peeplivan is my slave
the prince will also be my slave.
Sometimes, I feel like
appointing you as a comedian.
How much entertain you do!
How did you get the idea
of becoming the prince of Peeplivan?
Commander Bhadrasaal
had told me
that you had killed
the people of Peeplivan.
When the gatekeeper
asked for my introduction
I thought that one day's prince
cannot get a better name than this
because the people
who have turned into ashes
will not come to tell
me that I am not their prince.
Secondly, this one day's prince
will remember his respect
that coming in the way
of the king is equivalent to
the last day of his life.
Very good.
You insulted Peeplivan and
praised the king in one sentence.
I have never heard
or seen such an insult
of Peeplivan before this.
Right, Mura?
Mura, Peeplivan's prince is here.
He must be tired.
Make arrangements to wash his feet.
Right, Nanny?
Come on, move forward.
Come on, Mura.
'No, this is wrong.'
'How can I let her wash my feet?'
My Lord. Forgive me.
This handmaiden was
wasting a lot of time
in washing my feet.
And I have only one day
to live as a Prince.
And hence I do not wish
to waste even a mere moment
of my priceless time, Sire.
You are unique!
I would have been so happy if I could
get to spend some more time with you.
But I am left with no choice.
I have to welcome someone
who is very dear to me.
Bhadrasaal.
Make certain
that today is his most joyous
and most fortunate day of his life.
A day that this slave..
No! No!
A day that this Prince never forgets.
'What if the special person
that he is so eager to welcome'
'turns out to be my mother?'
'I have to do something.'
These grapes are very expensive.
I will rather buy some apples.
Do you have enough
coins to buy apples?
You can get apples there.
Rest assured. I have a satchel full.
Princess Durdhara will arrive soon.
It is not enough.
Dhananand has kept a woman
in his palace and given
her the luxuries of a queen.
She is regarded as a queen.
Who is she?
Acharya, this is not true.
Dhananand is a being who
will turn a queen in a slave
so why will he honour a queen?
What did you say?
What Queen do you speak of?
Mura, the Queen of Piplivan.
To earn the trust of the nursemaid
I have betrayed poor Mura.
What did you do?
'Whose robe do you
carry in your satchel?'
'I will not fail you, Lady.'
'That robe is burned.'
'And the truth is out now.'
'Her son is alive.'
Dhananand wants to
kill that son of Mura
that was presumed
dead for past 12 years.
About 12 years ago?
So it means..
Dear God!
I want all the best singers
and dancers of the kingdom
to be present there
as I welcome Durdhara.
They have already been summoned,
Brother.
We have made all the
arrangements to welcome her.
Such a special person is being greeted
in such a simple manner?
Simply changing the flowers
and having people dance
does not quite become
a grand welcome, Sire.
Wait, Pandu.
Patience. Have some patience.
I know that this boy
reminds you of a great pain.
But you must jolt back to reality.
For now this kid is our
guest and we must treat our guests
with great love and respect.
So tell me, O' Prince.
What were you saying?
Sire, as I was saying..
You are the Lord of Magadha.
The mightiest of all.
The most prosperous ruler.
And if you are to welcome a dear one
then it must be a grand festival.
Something unique!
Your subjects have only
seen your rage and fury.
If now you
were to show them a
different side of yours..
Then it will be a matter of great joy.
You have become a Prince for one day
and now you think like a Prince.
My brothers.
You all must act as
our guest has suggested.
Sire, I have a request.
Speak forth.
I have been given a chance
to be a Prince for a day
and I wish to live every
moment in the royal luxury.
Now that I have made a suggestion
will I not be invited to the event?
Certainly, you will be.
You will be invited.
All hail the generous Lord Dhananand!
- All hail the generous Lord Dhananand!
- Hail!
- All hail the generous Lord Dhananand!
- Hail!
All hail the generous Lord Dhananand!
'Now I have got a chance
to enter the festival'
'and I hope that special
person is my mother.'
What are you saying, Acharya Chanakya?
The truth that Magadha
was unaware for past 12 years.
Chandragupta is the son of Mura.
But he is a mere slave.
He is a slave
but he was born as
a Prince of Piplivan.
And I am certain
that Mura sold him away
to save him from Dhananand.
So that be it as a slave
her son does get to live.
So what now?
Now Chandragupta's
life is in grave peril.
On one side we have Pandu,
elder brother of Dhananand.
One that must be seeking
revenge from Chandragupta.
And then we have Dhananand himself.
And if he even senses
that Chandragupta is Mura's son
then my vision and Chandragupta..
Both will perish.
Slave, I have not yet forgotten
the way you mocked
the people of Piplivan.
One day you might understand
that one must be kind to others.
Maitri, we need to
ascertain one more thing.
Even Chandragupta and Mura
must be kept from the truth.
Dhananand is a wicked person.
And if he even doubts
it he will kill both of them.
You must go to the palace at once.
I understand, Acharya.
My conjecture was right.
This is Chandragupta's fate.
It will be Chandragupta
that will be the next emperor
of this great land of Bharat!

================================================================================

Episode: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeERQV-41yU

Come on, Durdhara.
I can't wait any longer.
I get the feeling that the
king is very fond of my mother.
She must be very special.
Tell me something..
Do you know
the person who is supposed
to come here for whom
$these arrangements have been made?
I-I meant to say..
I have never seen the king
waiting so eagerly for anyone.
Slave, I have not yet forgotten
the way you mocked
the people of Peeplivan.
Perhaps you might realise someday
that you should behave
properly with others.
'What is she talking
to that slave about?'
'This kid must be
around 16 years old.'
She is here.. She is here..
You are welcome, Durdhara.
I hope your journey was pleasant.
Durdhara!
Durdhara!
What is the matter?
Who is the person whose absence
has left the king of Magadh in shock?
She is not my mother.
'No one else apart from the king
can sit on the king's throne, kid.'
She is a fool to have
joked with the king.
Now the wicked king will decapitate
this poor woman.
The apple of my eye
the only star in my sky..
I welcome you, my dear sister.
Sister..
Brother..
Do not ever play such jokes.
My heart had stopped
beating for a moment, Sister.
I surprise every one
but you shouldn't surprise me.
I am your sister,
I'd to do something unexpected.
I have made special
arrangements to welcome you.
- Hail Princess Durdhara!
- Hail!
- Hail Princess Durdhara!
- Hail!
- Hail Princess Durdhara!
- Hail!
- Hail Princess Durdhara!
- Hail!
'Who is this young prince
that is not smitten by my beauty?'
I thought my mother would be here
but she is the Emperor's sister.
Now it seems that
I have to seek my mother
in the great festival.
Brother Pandu,
we have made the arrangements
to have that slave
killed in the festival.
Would you like to see?
Splendid!
I had to lose my finger
because of that boy
and now he will lose his life.
'Where is my mother?'
'If she was so crucial
for the Emperor'
'then why is she not seen around him?'
'Dear God! I hope that kid is safe!'
Can I get a drink?
You are not of age to drink mead yet.
Did you see that, my Lord?
It seems Mura is desperate
to find her son.
I am waiting direly for that
day when her son is in front of me
and then I will Mura's son
along with her motherhood.
Why do you keep scolding
me as if I am your son?
I wish I was your mother
as I would have raised
you a better lad
than your mother did.
What?
What did you say?
Do you know what entails this insult?
Yes. Go ahead.
Go to the great Emperor of Magadha
and report him of my insolence,
O great Prince.
I do not have time to waste.
You may offer this drink
to the ones you want to.
I have my own phantoms to deal with.
Brother Pandu.
You had told me that you a great
presentation for me when I arrive.
Where is it?
Wait a little, my Sister.
It is the next act.
Brother Pandu is averting
his gaze from you, Brother.
Why do I feel that
he did not lose his finger
in a wild hunt as he claims he did?
It has to do something with you.
- Am I right?
- This is it.
This is what I love
the most about you.
No one in this whole world
can understand me better than you do.
It is the right of an
Emperor to rule his people
and his family as he sees fit.
He must be ready to do as he pleases.
Truly said.
No one carries a higher
rank than the Emperor!
But I do follow commands
ones gives by my sister.
The presentation is ready, my Sister.
This is man eater tiger, my Sister.
This man here will put
the beast through the ring.
Splendid. It will be such a thrill.
Am I right, Brother?
Begin the act!
Save me.. Help.. Save me..
Someone save me.. Help..
Help.. Save me.. Help.. Help..
Save me..
Someone should save this boy!
Help him!
Make haste!
I have heard that a boy
is fighting a man eater tiger.
'Now Chandragupta's
life is in grave peril.'
'We have a threat, Dhananand himself.'
'And if he even senses
that Chandragupta is Mura's son'
'then my vision and Chandragupta..'
'Both will perish.'
Splendid.
Brother, now I will
have what my heart seeks.
'Your life ends now.'
My bracelet!
'Mother!'
'It is him..'
'He is my son Chandragupta.'
No!
'Why is she so worried?
Why such agony?'
'Such shades of fear!'
'What is this boy to you, Mura?'
How come that boy agreed
to go to the palace
despite refusing to go there earlier?
And what is the story
behind the bangle?
Dhananand has a doubt on the relation
between Mura and Chandragupta.

================================================================================

Episode: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRycwYGnV7Y

"Chandragupta! Chandragupta!"
"Chandragupta Maurya! Chandragupta!"
Unbelievable!
He is a slave but he
has courage in his blood.
You are the slave in the garb
of a real prince who came forward
and challenged a ferocious tiger!
'Destiny always plays truant..'
'My son showed up
in front of the king'
'as the prince of Piplivan.'
I.. I want to embrace you.
Come forward!
Look at the generosity
of King Dhananand.
He embraced a slave.
- Hail King Dhananand!
- Hail!
- Hail King Dhananand!
- Hail!
- Hail King Dhananand!
- Hail!
- Hail King Dhananand!
- Hail!
- Hail King Dhananand!
- Hail!
- Hail King Dhananand!
- Hail!
Dirty clothes do not
look good on a prince.
Keeping the status of a prince
only a member of the royal family
will go ahead and
maintain his hygiene.
Brother Pandu.
I know that you are wounded, Brother.
But at the same time,
you are a valiant warrior
who has the expertise of
wielded swords with two hands.
So it will not be a difficult task
to clean the prince with one hand.
Am I right, Brother?
Brother, you are forgetting
that an emperor has his eyes
trained on his men, his family members
and everywhere.
I am in no doubt that at this moment
your heart is filled with
loathe and hatred for this boy.
Yes.
I had seen that expression
of hatred in you when this boy
had fallen in the tiger's cage.
At the same time,
I also saw the expression
of someone else when the boy
came out unharmed from the cage.
Expectations,
sadness, fear and a sigh of relief..
I saw all these at this very moment.
Brother.
Amazing!
In this attire I am looking like
a member of the royal family, right?
Today, the emperor was too generous
to summon you to his personal chamber.
Keep your expectations
within your limit.
Leave this place quickly.
'Destiny is not being on my side'
'or else I would
have found my mother.'
'I have to do something.'
'Even after becoming a prince
I am not able to find my mother'
'then being a slave,
this would be a difficult task.'
What are you thinking now?
- Follow me.
- Oh, God!
Because of my wound
m not able to match your speed.
will follow you.
Good Lord!
Hail the Emperor!
Did you summon me?
Yes, Amatya.
You have to play a game.
A game? What kind of a game, Emperor?
A game of guessing.
Can you tell me,
out of the women standing here
who could be the mother of this boy?
No.
Your Highness.
Possibilities and estimations
are not always true.
And you know it very well
that I cannot tell
a lie in front of you
in any condition.
But..
The relation between a mother
and her child is never a lie.
They have blood relation.
- My son!
- Did you see that?
Did you see that, Amatya?
Did you see the expression
of pain on this woman's face?
I saw the same
expression on Mura's face
when that prince for a
day was fighting with the lion.
Move!
'No!'
So, do you mean
that there is a possibility
that the boy is the lost son of Mura?
Amatya, you just said
that possibilities can be false
and I want to know the
truth of this possibility.
Because it is not
just about a servant.
It is about the heir of Piplivan.
I will collect all his information,
Your Highness.
If your suspicion turns out to be true
then I swear this on God,
today will be
the last day of that
prince of Piplivan.
Go ahead.
'I have to inform
this to Sage Chanakya.'
So many royal women? Probably..
One of them may be my mother.
Apart from my brother
Dhananand and some of the maids
no one else is allowed
to enter this chamber!
'Yes.'
'Princess Durdhara can
be helpful in achieving my goal.'
'I just have to convince her.'
What are you thinking about?
I-I am thinking that
jewellery looks good
in hands so soft and
a princess so beautiful.
Not a sword.
And you are raising
the sword against the one
who defeated a lion
with his bare hands.
There is a difference
between the lion in a cage
and an independent princess
of Magadha kingdom, boy.
No..
I will not believe
it without any proof.
First, defeat me in swordplay
and give me the proof
of your strength.
- What?
- Why?
You started asking questions,
instead of showing the sword
by listening to my challenge?
I knew
that there is no difference
between a princess
and a beautiful doll.
Please stop me, Princess.
I accept.
I accept your challenge.
I will prove that beauty
can be dangerous as well.
Okay.
But even I have a condition.
If you defeat me
then I will do whatever you will ask.
And if I defeat you
then you will show me
this chamber from the inside.
I accept.
Excellent.
I made the sister of His Highness
accept two things in
the first meeting itself.
It is not a bad start.
Maitri gave the order to
return this basket of apples.
Many apples got rotten within a day.
What is the news, Sage Chanakya?
The news is not good, Shatkar.
Dhananand has a doubt on the relation
between Mura and Chandragupta.
And to clear his doubt
he even gave the order to Amatya.
If Dhananand's doubt is cleared
and if he gets to know the
truth about Chandragupta and Mura
then he will kill them.
Shatkar, we have to
stop Lubdhak at any cost
so that he cannot tell the truth
about Chandragupta to Amatya.
Tell me!
What is the secret behind this!
Please trust me, Amatya.
I do not know much about the past
of that servant. Please let me go.
I need to go to the physician.
I am feeling tremendous
pain in my legs.
Your pain can increase further
if I am not satisfied
with your answer.
I need an answer of this question.
How come that boy agreed
to go to the palace
despite refusing to go there earlier?
Who does not care
for his life, Amatya?
I told him that he will be whipped
if he does not obey the King.
And what is the story
behind the bangle?
That boy challenged a lion
in order to obtain that bangle.
Answer me!
Oh! That bangle!
I have asked you something.
I need an answer to my question,
Lubdhak.
That bangle is his mother's keepsake
who is no more.
That idiot considers that bangle
his mother's blessing.
That is why he always
keeps that with him.
Please allow me to visit a physician
if you are satisfied with my answers.
If..
If any of your answers is proven false
I swear on Lord Shiva
I will behead you.
Keep this in mind.
Dhumketu
Stulbhadra, Indra..
You have done an incredible job.
Rest assured now.
Your friend Chandragupta
will return from the palace
hale and hearty soon.
What kind of a prince are you
who does not even carry a sword?
Tell me the truth.
Are you really a prince?
Tell me.
'If Dhanadhand's sister finds out'
'that I am not a prince
then I can get in trouble.'
I agree with you, Acharya.
But Lubdhak's false story
will not keep Dhananand
in dark for a long time.
Your proposed plan is too risky.
It is like putting your
hand in the lion's mouth.
Dhananand is not a lion.
He is a bloodthirsty wolf.
Someone has to put his
hand in the lion's mouth
if we want to save our
motherland from that wolf.
Nothing is impossible.
One can achieve any goal
if he is determined and
ready to put everything at stake.
I am an ordinary Brahmin
who does not have any army.
I have nothing but knowledge which
I have earned through my hard work.
Even then I have taken a vow
that I will destroy Dhananand
and give united India an
efficient emperor in his place.
And I am ready to put
my everything at stake
in order to achieve my goal.
But Chandragupta has to stay alive
if we want him to sit on the throne.
And I will execute my plan for sure
in order to save Chandragupta's life
without any fear and hesitation.
Okay, let us proceed.
The first and most important thing is
we need to send a
message to the palace.
Tell me the truth.
Are you really a prince?
Tell me.
'You must come up with some idea,
Chandra.'
'If she finds out
that I am not a prince'
'then she won't take me
to one of those special chambers.'
Strength doesn't come from weapons,
it dwells in a person.
Whether the sword belongs
to the father or the son
it all depends on who is wielding it.
'I do not know why I feel
a sense of attachment here.'
'This one..'
'These are the shields and
swords of the king of Piplivan.'
'He raised his voice
in front of the emperor.'
Let both of them
meet and let them unite.
And then I will introduce
the Prince of Piplivan
to death.
Chandra..

'Why do I sense such
familiarity here?'
'He is my son Chandragupta.'
'I will bring your son before you.'
'And I will end your trouble,
which is your son in front of you.'
'I must find Chandragupta
immediately.'
Listen!
Have you seen the Prince of Piplivan?
I do not care about the servant
who is pretending
to be a prince for a day
nor do I care about you a slave
who still considers
herself to be the queen.
'Why do you keep staring
at me as if you are my mother?'
What happened?
I-I am coming!
What is the matter?
Did this heavy sword
shatter your courage?
It seems,
you are not ready for a duel.
'I have no idea how
to fight with a sword.'
'How will I do it?'
I am ready!
Where is my husband's sword?
Who dared to touch the
sword of the King of Piplivan?
'What is wrong with me?'
'I might put the life
of my son in jeopardy'
'by showing care towards my son
in front of the sister of Dhananand.'
I won! You lost!
This is wrong. You cheated!
Everything is fair in love and war..
My dear princess!
You cannot wield a sword,
but can only make tall claims.
Forget about me.
You are the Princess!
And do you remember your promise?
You must show me that chamber now.
The royal family never
forgets its promises.
Come with me.
Please wait.
I need to keep this
sword where it belongs.
I am grateful!
It is said that a sword cuts through.
But today, because of this sword
I will be able to
unite with my mother.
The one with whom my ties are cut off.
Chandra..
'Why did I feel that someone
called me out by my name?'
'Nobody here knows my name.
So who could it be?'
What happened?
It seems you changed your mind.
Should I change mine too?
No, I am coming right away.
I know that he is your son, Mura.
Yes, and to save his life,
I stopped you from meeting him.
'Oh, whose robe is this in your bag?'
'I have no idea whose robe
this is and where it came from.'
'Maitri!'
'Her son is alive.'
What new game are
you playing now, Maitri
the head handmaiden of Lady?
You too are a handmaiden
but are you in support of Magadha?
Mura, we have the same goal.
Do not play such
games with me, Maitri.
Because of you,
they found out that my son is alive.
Yes.. I had to do it!
In order to win the
trust of the King, I did it.
This is what secret informers do.
And if you do not listen to me
your son might not survive here.
'Did you see that?'
'It seems Mura is desperate'
'to show her motherhood again.'
'I wish to know how
accurate this suspicion is.'
'Because this is
no more about a servant'
'but the successor of Piplivan.'
'I will gather all
the information I can.'
'The truth about Mura and
that slave will soon be revealed.'
My brother always picks the best.
Do you agree?
Of course!
How do I find out
who she is?
What did you say?
No.. I just said..
How do I tell you
that there is nobody here
whose beauty and radiance
can be compared to yours?
There is no one like you.
Oh, it is you!
You are strange!
When I asked for it,
you did not give me.
And now..
What?
Did this handmaiden refuse your order?
Mura, you..
Unbelievable!
I know who you are looking for.
After the sun sets, see me
by the south gate of Red Forest.
Mura kept us in the
dark and lied to us all.
You were right.
That prince who came
here for a day is Mura's son.
And he..
Dhananand?
Dhananand!
Dhananand!
I am right here!
Dhananand!
Dhananand, where are you?
Right here!
Where, Dhananand? Where are you?
I am here!
Do you think I am interested in games?
Yes, my Lady.
Mura was playing
hide-and-seek with us.
And now, I am practising my turn.
We will have to hide when both
mother and son meet at Red Forest.
Why do you have to do that?
Why do you just not kill him?
- You are so innocent.
- What?
Revenge is a dish
best served cold!
Let both of them
meet and let them unite.
Let them cry for one another.
And then I will introduce
the Prince of Piplivan to death.
After meeting his mother,
he will meet his deceased father.
I am the emperor.
I cannot break my promise.
'I will bring your son before you.'
'And I will end your trouble,
which is your son in front of you.'
I will fulfill my promise
by killing Mura's son in front of her.
And the death of her son
will shatter
the courage of that Kshatrani.
'My son will exact
revenge on Dhananand.'
'Dhananand's death is near, my Lord.'
'If I defeat you'
'you will show me that
chamber from within.'
Durdhara.. Durdhara, my dear..
Who am I?
Durdhara!
I am Durdhara,
the Princess of Magadha.
The darling sister of
Emperor Dhananand, Durdhara.
In the entire nation
there is nobody as skilled, beautiful
and wealthy as I am.
And I fought that boy
according to his rules.
After being defeated,
I even kept my word.
I showed him the entire chamber.
And what did he do?
Without meeting me
or informing me, he left.
Such insolence!
Nobody has ever offended
me this way before.
Are you really laughing?
Yes.
You should be upset.
I am happy to see you upset.
The Princess of Magadha
the sister of Emperor Dhananand
must have some self-respect.
And when your ego is hurt
you should be upset.
This pain suits you
but these tears do not.
These tears prove you weak.
But if he had to leave
he could have met me first.
Please come with me. Come on..
The members of the royal family have
many responsibilities to cater to.
The Prince of Piplivan
left without meeting you
because he is out there
to meet two important people.
The one who gave birth to him
and the one
who will finish him.

================================================================================

Episode: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8vUKGz-JMo

This smell..
Do you remember anything, Amatya?
This is the smell of
blood that I'd shed years ago
by killing Mura's husband,
the king of Piplivan.
And the same smell
will spread again all over
when I kill his son.
Where is Mura?
Yes, she is there.
The queen of Piplivan has arrived.
'Where are you, Chandragupta?'
The prince of Piplivan
is very mischievous.
He is making his mother wait.
And she is yearning to meet her son.
"The prince of Piplivan,
come here soon."
Wherever you may be, please come soon.
All of us are waiting for you.
'She.. She is the same slave.'
'Is she my mother?'
'Has she called me to an isolated
place to reveal her identity?'
'Mother..'
This spectacle is so tragic, Amatya.
This emotionally drained spectacle
can melt anyone's heart.
I cannot wait anymore.
Let us go and end
this chapter right away.
You are always in a hurry.
There is no fun in
separation before an union.
It will be fun when
their union will
transform into separation.
Let a mother meet her son.
Let the mother feel those
same emotions once again.
You are right, Your Highness.
Why have you called me here?
I have called you
here to tell a truth.
And it is important
for you to know this truth.
And no one else can tell
you this truth except me.
And the truth is
I am not Dhananand's slave.
I am a queen, the queen of Piplivan.
- The queen of Piplivan!
- Yes.
And I am the mother
of the prince of Piplivan.
And you.. Do you know who you are?
Tell him..
Tell him those golden words which
Magadh is yearning to hear from you.
And you are not the prince
of Piplivan.
Yes, you slave.
You will never become
the prince of Piplivan
just by pretending to be
one and wearing the royal attire.
Because I can recognise
my son very well.
If you just wanted to tell me
that you are the queen of Piplivan..
You could have told me
the same even in the palace.
And as far as my identity is concerned
I know I am not the prince of Piplivan.
I was aware of this.
Why did you call
me here to tell me this?
It was required.
It was necessary to tell you this.
That's because when you'd made
fun of the royal family
of Piplivan inside the palace
I felt shattered.
Names are meaningless
unless there are emotions
attached to it, you slave.
I called you here
so that you meet my son
the actual prince.
Veerbhadra?
He is my son Veerbhadra.
The actual prince of Piplivan.
He will make me proud
and reinstate my honour.
He will kill Dhananand.
I called you here
because I've seen
your courage and wisdom.
I remember the incident
when you'd saved those
youth from that evil Dhananand.
'You passed your judgement'
'and it has left everyone in fear.'
'Please pass another judgement'
'and release these innocents,
Emperor.'
'Go and set them free yourself.'
I remember the way
you had tackled that tiger.
I want you to be
his friend in this war.
I've been tolerating
Dhananand's atrocities
but my wait is over now.
Now my son will take revenge
with Nand's blood.
He will avenge every
drop of tear that I've shed.
This heir of the Maurya dynasty
will destroy Dhananand
and his entire family.
In this difficult battle
he will need your support.
Yes, friend, I'm ready to avenge
my father's murder
and my mother's insult.
But I need your support for that.
Enough.. I can't tolerate this.
She's conspiring against
the king of Magadh before my eyes
and I am unable to do anything.
Give me orders.
I'll kill them all in a second.
Be patient, Amatya.
I want to see what this kid does.
If he joins hands
with Mura and her son
two young boys will be
killed here instead of one.
Come, dear, join hands with my son.
Support us in this revolution
and help us take revenge.
Come, dear, join hands with my son.
We are talking about our
battle and you are laughing.
That's because you are joking with me.
Look, you're misunderstanding.
I can't fight against
such a powerful king.
But this is not about us
it is about our motherland.
- Yes, friend.
- Wait a second.
Neither am I your friend
nor do I want to befriend a person
who wants to stand in
water and fight a crocodile.
Piplivan is your country.
Its people are your subjects.
He is your son and
the revenge is also yours.
So why should I risk my life?
Besides the emperor
hasn't been unjust to me.
Although for a day, he made a prince.
Why should I go against him?
Amazing..
This kid has impressed me.
He knows very well
about how to be loyal.
You can't have my loyalty.
Goodbye.
You.. You are her son.
Stop her.
She doesn't have any idea
that her plan will bring her end.
But before that her son will die.
You are my lucky charm, slave!
First you found the
crown of my golden statue.
You then brought my brother's
conspiracy to my attention.
Now, my wait for 12 years has
finally come to an end because of you.
All this wouldn't have happened
just by making you a prince for a day.
I will give you a
reward worth remembering.
Veerbhadra!
No!
Take a look, Mura! Take a look.
I am now fulfilling the promise
that I had made to you.
I will kill your son
right in front of you.
You were conspiring to kill me,
weren't you?
Now watch me kill the
last of the Maurya Clan's heir.
No, Emperor. Stop!
Don't kill him.
Stop. Don't kill him.
Don't kill him. Stop. Don't kill him.
Don't kill him.
- Don't kill him. Don't kill him.
- No! No, mother.
No, mother. Stop.
- Don't kill him. Don't kill him.
- Or he'll kill you as well.
Remember this moment if you
ever dare to protest against me.
'No.'
'This is impossible, Acharya.'
'No, Acharya.
I do not agree with your plan.'
'Only a mother knows
the pain of losing her son.'
'You will not understand it.'
'You are unable to hear
the cries of your motherland..'
'The country is divided.'
'Foreigners want to invade it.'
'The countrymen want to be free
from cruel rulers like Dhananand.'
'Chandragupta is
an able lad to do it.'
'So, we have )o fulfill the plan.'
'Do you want me to risk a boy's life'
'to save my son's life?'
'My motherland is what I care about'
'the most.'
'When I unbraided my hair'
'in Dhananand's royal court'
'I had promised that I
will eliminate his lineage.'
'But people like him are
not just limited to Magadh.'
'There are many others
like him in this nation.'
'The nation needs a person like
Chandra to ensure its bright future.'
'He can use his might to get
alleviate the people's sufferings.'
'He is a promising lad,
Your Highness.'
'But for that to happen,
Chandra needs to stay alive.'
'Queen Mura'
'it is not a cruel thought'
'to lose a son for the sake
of the country's well-being.'
'Rather, it is a sacrifice.'
'When the person is
ready to sacrifice his life'
'for the sake of the nation,
what will you tell him?'
'Do you want to see
how eager Veerbhadra is'
'to sacrifice his
life for his nation?'
- 'Veerbhadra.
- Acharya!'
'Define religion.'
'It's the state of eagerness'
'to lay down our lives
for the sake of our nation.'
'Who fights a battle against whom?'
'The righteous wages
a war against the wrong.'
'What is dearer to
you than your life?'
'Independence.'
'Define it.'
'It is the right to lead
life in your own terms.'
'What is the basis of
victory in this battle?'
'Martyrdom.'
'If you were to die today
what will be your last wish?'
'I wish to be reborn to sacrifice
my life for my motherland.'
"Chanakya.."
'Mura, it is the time to sacrifice.'
'Be strong.'
'That will be the first step'
'to a golden future
of a united nation.'
'Though you are younger to me'
'I cannot help'
'but bow down to you.'
'I bow down to you'
'and your mother.'
'No, ma'am.'
'Even if I need to lay
down my life multiple times'
'I will not hesitate.'
'Let this sacrifice help
the nation get an able ruler.'
Mura, take a look!
I have killed your son.
The last male of your
family has been laid to rest.
Not only have I defeated your kingdom
but also your desire to seek revenge
on king Dhananand.
- Hail King Dhananand!
- Hail!
- Hail King Dhananand!
- Hail!
- Hail King Dhananand!
- Hail!
- Hail King Dhananand!
- Hail!
What are you doing?
He lost his identity because of me.
I am returning his identity to him.
So, you dare to disregard my orders.

================================================================================

Episode: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4jqXrj5ylk

Look. Look, Mura. Look.
Today, your entire
clan has been destroyed.
Your husband is dead.
Today, you have not
only lost Piplivan to me
but also failed to
exact revenge on me.
-Hail Emperor Dhananand!
-Hail!
-Hail Emperor Dhananand!
-Hail!
-Hail Emperor Dhananand!
-Hail!
-Hail Emperor Dhananand!
-Hail!
-Hail Emperor Dhananand!
-Hail!
-Hail Emperor Dhananand!
-Hail!
Yes, Mura!
Now, I am seeing
the thing on your face
which I was longing
to see from many years.
A queen's ego
got shattered.
Isn't it?
But don't think everything
has come to an end for you.
You still have to
go through a lot yet.
I will hang the dead body
of your prince at the
main square of Pataliputra.
Slowly, his body will start
emancipating a rotten smell.
And the residents of Pataliputra
will never forget that
smell for their entire life.
It will keep reminding them
that this would be the consequence
of rising against me.
Slave.
What are you doing?
He lost his identity because of me.
I am returning his identity to him.
Perhaps, you didn't
hear what the emperor said.
He won't get a funeral.
Your Highness
you are the Lord of Magadh.
You have completely
destroyed the Maurya clan
without sparing anyone, anywhere.
Your Highness,
you won't gain any more fame
or popularity by depriving
his dead body a funeral.
Slave.
But if you give this lady the right
to conduct the funeral of her son
not only will be
she be indebted to you
but even the subjects
will praise your generosity.
After the attack you made today
has left this woman devastated
for the rest of her life.
And that is what you wanted.
So, you dare to disregard my orders.
No, Your Highness.
I am only requesting you.
You did whatever you thought was right
to save your rule and kingdom.
Now, kindly allow me to do
the thing which I feel is right.
Allow me to conduct the funeral
of this young man with all honours.
Okay.
I am giving you the permission
only because I am pleased with you.
-Amatya.
-Yes, Your Highness?
Help this servitor to
arrange the funeral procession
of the prince of Piplivan.
Oh!
It is the funeral procession
of the late prince of Piplivan.
Is it not, Mura?
There was not any sign of despair
on Veerbhadra's face
even for a moment.
He was fearless even
when he was about to die.
He died with a smile on his face.
That's because he was aware
that he was not dying
but was about to become immortal.
Now, Veerbhadra has become immortal
by becoming the first foundation stone
towards building a free India.
Veerbhadra, I salute your sacrifice.
Veerbhadra, you'll be
remembered as the first martyr
who laid down his
life to make Chandragupta
the future emperor of free Bharat.
Your death will make the
burning desire to make India free
even more intense.
Here you go.
You will be writing the
end of the Maurya dynasty.
May his soul rest in peace!
Lady, I will not be able to return
your son to you.
But I know how it feels.
Because many years ago, I too had lost
my mother.
But, lady,
now, you have lost your son.
I will pray to God
to grant you the courage and strength
to lead your life without your son.
Your Highness, the term of me
playing the prince for a day is over.
Allow me to leave now.
Wait, slave.
I remember you telling me
that the names of the
servants are not important.
That they do not have any identity.
But even then
I want to know your name.
What is your name?
Chandragupta.
Chandragupta.
It is a nice name.
I will remember it.
"Chandragupta Maurya.."
All right,
if you do not want to tell me
about your fight with the lion,
do not tell me.
But at least tell me how soft
were the huge beds of that huge palace
and how well does
one sleep on those beds.
I did not get time to sleep
but what I saw
after that I shall not
be able to sleep for months.
The king slayed that
young and innocent prince
so mercilessly.
I shall never be able
to forget that incident
even if I want to.
And his mother, her tears..
There was his mother,
if one saw her it would seem
as if she lost everything
with her son dead.
And then there is my mother,
who for some amount of money
sold me off.
A warrior won today but a mother..
A mother
has lost.
A mother has lost today.
The Maurya clan has become
forever indebted to you, Veerbhadra.
But we shall avenge your sacrifice.
The dream that you
have given your blood for
my son, Chandra,
shall make it come true.
It will be Chandra,
who will end this tyranny
with the light of his sword
and create a new India.
After meeting the epitome
of motherly love and compassion
I felt that it was good
that Lubdhak did not give
me the complete address of my mother.
I wonder how she must have become
by living with the king,
the one who is my mother.
By the way, where is Lubdhak?
Oh, him!
He must be at some doctor's.
He must be taking special
treatment and suggestions
so that he does not feel much
pain while sitting and standing.
What?
Hey! He means,
when you were in the palace
Amatya Rakshas had come here with
some soldiers to enquire about you.
'I want the answer to this question'
'that despite refusing
to go to the palace'
'how did that boy get
ready to go to the palace?'
'Who does not love his life, Amatya?'
'I told him that if he
does not follow the royal orders'
'then he will be flogged with a whip.'
If Amatya had come to know
that I had gone to
the palace with a motive
then that cruel king
would have beheaded me.
Thank you for this help.
Thank you?
Do not thank us,
thank Acharya Chanakya
upon whose directions,
we did all this.
Acharya Chanakya? Who?
Chandra, he is the same person
who had returned your bangle.
'A valuable object
of yours is safe with me.'
'First, he returned me my bangle.'
'And now he is helping
me against Amatya.'
'What does he want?'
'Why is that man following me?'
I hope that the information
of your spy is correct.
Is Chanakya hiding around here?
All the information given by him
till today has proved to be correct.
Bhairav.
What happened, Acharya?
I have heard the
footsteps of some people.
Get out of here.
There is no place to
hide over here, Acharya.
Sire, look over there.
The game of hide and seek is over,
Chanakya.
Get up and see.
Your end is here.
"Chandragupta.."
"Chandragupta.."
You!
What are you doing here?
I have the same question.
Do you not have any
other important work
other than following me around?
Can I not sleep peacefully
after becoming a prince for a day?
I am tired, sire. Let me sleep.
You are not that important
that we would follow you every time.
We had the information
of someone else being here.
No matter what excuse you give
but the truth is that you did not like
my being a prince for a day.
Am I right? Is that not true?
Let's go.
I know where you are hiding.
You can come out now.
"Chanakya.."
"Chanakya.."
"Chanakya.."
"Chanakya.."
Thank you.
There is no need to thank me.
You saved me from Lubdhak
and today I saved
you from these soldiers.
So, we are even.
Now you tell me.
Why are you following me?
What is your purpose behind it?
You had my mother's bangle
and you also knew how
important it is for me.
How?
Now do not say that you did
not have any self-interest behind it.
Because nobody can be selfless.
Even my mother sold me
for her own selfish reasons.
And you are a stranger to me.
There is a difference between
selfishness and purpose, Chandragupta.
And you are my purpose.
My purpose is united Bharat.
My purpose is to awaken
you towards your own purpose.
So that you could become
the emperor of Bharat in future.
Emperor Chandragupta.
"Chanakya.."
"Chanakya.."
Now you are totally independent,
Chandragupta.
You are right. Totally independent.
From your dreams of one
nation and making me it's ruler.
The end of slavery marks the beginning
of training the future leader.

================================================================================

Episode: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Io3__RSJ9o

It is my intention to
make you aware of your destiny
so that you can become the
king of united India in future.
King Chandragupta!
What?
What?
What did you say, Acharya?
Stuck India?
United India.
A unified India.
A united India which will be ruled
by one ruler with one thought process.
Are you a Brahmin or a comedian?
Acharya,
the land that you are standing on
is not India, but Magadha
which has a ruler.
King Dhananand.
I am undoubtedly standing in Magadha.
But the vast land of which
Magadha is a part is India
which is ruled by many selfish
and cruel kings like Dhananand.
This country is akin to that body
which needs a brain.
This country requires a guiding hand
which thinks only about
the welfare of the country.
And you will be that guiding hand,
Chandragupta.
I can see the qualities
of India's future ruler in you.
Acharya, it seems that the soldiers
of Magadha have troubled you a lot
due to which you are
unable to complete your sleep.
Will.. Will you make me a ruler?
Can you see this shackle?
It is a symbol of slavery.
And a slave cannot
give orders like a king.
He becomes a slave and follows orders.
Chandragupta,
a person is a slave only to his mind.
A person who crosses the river
by surpassing the speed of the water
is the one who writes history.
And this speed gives rise to a notion.
A notion is being followed from ages
that only the Kshatriyas can rule.
Your king, Dhananand, broke this rule.
He experienced that
non-Kshatriyas can also rule.
He worked hard to succeed in his goal
and became the king.
It is not important where
the person has come from.
But the direction in which
his thought process takes him
is more important.
If you do a deed by
keeping a goal in mind
then nothing is impossible
in this world, Chandragupta.
Even you can become a king.
So, break the shackles
of the mind and not the body.
Brahmin, I heard your advice.
Accept my suggestion now.
Can you see that stack of hay?
Go there and complete your sleep.
When a person does
not complete his sleep
he starts daydreaming.
Brahmin.. Will you make me a king?
Will you establish a united India?
Lord, please give him some knowledge
before the King of Magadha kills him.
Give him some knowledge, Lord.
Give him some knowledge, Lord.
Give him some knowledge..
Give him some knowledge..
Give him some knowledge, Lord.
Acharya, it is all Greek to him.
Acharya, how will you make
this illiterate boy a king?
Through constant efforts, Bhairav.
Even the rocks near a riverbank
shape up and become beautiful
after being hit by the waves.
My efforts will be akin
to the waves of the sea
that keep forming continuously.
Just wait and watch.
Even he will change someday.
As is the king, so are the subjects.
So far, I thought that
only the king is stupid.
But after meeting this Brahmin
I realised the people
here are also stupid.
It is you.
Why do you walk so fast?
Because nothing is
more important than time.
Chandragupta, when it is
about the security of the country
it is a crime to waste time.
Chandragupta, I know
that my words sound
like a dream to you.
But remember one thing.
A dream seen by one person
always remains a dream.
But the dream lived by
two people becomes reality.
And I will prove this reality.
I will make you the
king of a united India.
Brahmin, tell me one thing.
How many kingdoms like
Magadha will united India have?
Many.
Many!
It is strange!
You do not know the number of kingdoms
that you have to unite.
Wow!
Around 400.
Four hundred!
These hens..
Catch my hens!
Can you see these hens?
Not even two hens are
following the same path.
All of them have found their own path.
How will 400 kings walk
together on the same path
when 10 hens cannot
walk on the same path?
There is no need to make
400 kings walk on the same path.
Our country needs one king.
A king who will unite
all the separated kingdoms
and lead them.
And you will be that king,
Chandragupta.
What have these stubborn hens done?
You are stubborn
my disciple.
Chandra, we ill-treated Lubdhak
to save you from the Amatya.
But Lubdhak is not a
fool to seek revenge from you.
Besides,
his wounds are still paining him.
He may get angry if he sees us.
So, be careful.
There is no need
to be scared of Lubdhak.
Come with me.
Let us go.
Chandra.
Come, dear, I was waiting for you.
Lubdhak,
let us forget what has happened.
Tell me what you are
expecting from me next.
What will I have to do?
No, you do not need
to do anything now.
This great, affluent man has
done everything that had to be done.
And he has paid me more
than what I had demanded
for your freedom.
From today, you are not my slave.
Thank this great person.
Who is this great person?
"He is Chanakya!"
"He is Chanakya!"
Lubdhak, you do not know this person.
He is insane!
Look here, Lubdhak.
I did want you wanted me to.
Then this deal should not be done.
Cancel the deal with him.
I will do what you want me to.
I will steal the
biggest of the treasures
but please do not
sell me to this person.
By the way, I am so useful to you.
You wanted to hear it from me,
did you not?
Then listen.
After all, I am a trader
and wealth is what I pray for.
I bought you in exchange for money
and now,
I sold you for the same purpose.
I have got so much money in
exchange of an insolent boy like you.
Even if I sell you six times,
I will not get this money.
Now, it is between
you and this person..
Your new master.
'I won! You lose!'
'This is wrong. You won by cheating!'
'Everything is fair in love and war.'
Shipra.. Shipra..
Durdhara..
Why are you so angry?
That is because I
want to go on a hunt.
Tell your brother, Commander Bhadrasal
to order his soldiers
to get the Prince of
Pippalivana to bow before me!
Bring him to me.
He should apologise to me
for not taking the permission from me
the Princess of Magadha,
to leave the palace.
- Get him..
- Princess.
The effect of blood
does not die down so easily.
After all
you are the sister of Dhananand.
What did you say?
What I said is right.
It is the good fortune of
Magadha to have a princess like you.
You would have done so much
if you had ascended the throne.
Just for a mere slave
you are wasting the
anger of a royal princess.
Think before you say something,
handmaiden.
He was not a slave
but the Prince of Piplivan.
A true prince by nature.
Was he a prince?
Durdhara, he was just a slave
whom our great king
had made a prince for a day
to enjoy the luxuries of
the royal palace as a reward.
Tell me the truth.
Are you really a prince?
'Strength doesn't come from weapons,
it dwells in a person.'
'Whether the sword belongs
to the father or the son'
'it all depends on
who is wielding it.'
Such.. Such audacity!
He lied to me!
He deceived me!
Along with being brave,
he is fortunate.
That is why..
A royal princess is making
herself suffer just for a mere slave.
I will not spare him.
First, I will..
Let her go.
She has lost her mind
after losing her son.
What are you looking at?
Take her away from here!
You do not have to
tell your brother anything.
That servant does not even
deserve to stay in my memories.
That is why we should not
waste our time and soldiers on him.
'I have been successful.'
'No soldier from Magadha
would follow Chandra.'
You told me to break
the shackles of my mind.
But you made me a servant.
You consider yourself a scholar,
do you not?
But you still supported the abominable
tradition of Magadha, slavery.
When I did not listen to you
you used the power
of money to enslave me.
You have bought me,
but I have not been sold.
Do whatever you can.
But I am not your slave!
Bhairav.
Oh!
You pretend to be
a non-violent scholar
but now, you are using weapons.
Use it.
Capture him.
Have you all lost it?
What is wrong with you?
You are my friends. Let me go!
You coaxed my friends
but I am not pressurised by anyone.
You want to attack me, right?
Do it. But I do not want to be a king.
Let him go.
You are free now, Chandragupta.
You can go wherever you want.
You can roam wherever you want.
But..
You will have to come
to meet me once in a day.
I have paid a lot for your freedom.
You will do that to show
your gratefulness, will you not?
I will.
I will definitely do that.
But soon,
I will repay you and become free.
Fatso!
Why did you all obey his command?
We are your friends, are we not?
That Brahmin wishes the good for you.
That Brahmin is insane!
No..
The way he works is unique,
but he achieves his goals.
You spent so much
money to buy that boy.
Do not call him a boy.
Address him as the future king.
All right. But why did you
buy him if you were going to free him?
What about the training
of the future king?
The training has begun, Bhairav.
But neither Chandragupta
nor you are aware of it.
The end of slavery
is the first step for
Chandragupta to become the king.
He has crossed that obstacle today.
"Chandragupta!"
Now, the journey shall begin.
The journey of Chandragupta
of becoming King Chandragupta.
"Chandragupta!"
He mistook an illusion as a reality
and had the audacity to misbehave
with my dearest Durdhara, the princess
of Magadha in front of my subjects.
Go, Amatya.
Wherever he is hiding bring
him and make him kneel before me.
Yes, Your Highness.

================================================================================

Attention, people of Magadha!
Attention!
Give way to her highness,
Princess Durdhara!
Shipra, your idea of going
for a procession is amazing!
That servant had unsettled me.
It is true that fresh
air calms your soul.
My anger seems to have evaporated!
Who dares obstruct her highness' path!
A farmer had no other
way of attracting the attention
of the royal family.
What foolishness is this!
- Do you know..
- Shipra.
Princess, it took me and my family
three months of hard work
to cultivate all these onions.
Royal officers are offering
only two coins for this.
I cannot even get food for
two days with that, Your Highness.
Give me justice, Your Highness..
Or ask his majesty to just kill us.
It is better to die
than live with this burden.
Hey!
Hey!
How come there is an onion is here?
Hey, that arrogant princess has got
a whole load of onions
in front of her.
You have accused his majesty
and his rule with a cruel allegation.
If any one of all the people
present here side with you
I will ask his majesty
to do justice for you.
Tell me.
Who else agrees with
this farmer's allegations?
There you go!
No one is siding with you.
It means that you are lying.
His Highness is the Lord of Magadha!
Are you aware of the
consequences that come
from accusing him?
Soldiers!
No, let me go..
Rather then watching this
poor man getting beaten up
let's just leave.
Help!
No! No!
Do not hit my son.
Have mercy on us, Princess.
Please forgive my son.
I beg you.
Do not hit my son.
"Chandragupta.."
"Chandragupta.."
You..
Yes, it is me.
If you raise your hand
to lash an innocent man
a hand must be raised to stop it.
This man had come to his
princess with his problems.
Instead of solving his problems,
you had him whipped!
You lashed at his mother.
What do you think of yourself!
All you are is the princess
of Magadha! That's it.
A mother is greater than
any emperor or a kingdom.
A mother is greater than the God!
"Chandragupta Maurya!"
It is good that you showed
yourself to me by yourself, slave.
You were a prince for a day
yet you do not know how
to behave with the royal family!
It is okay. I will teach you.
Soldiers, take him prisoner!
Oh, God! Problems find people.
But this guy goes
hunting for problems!
He will die!
But he take us down with him.
- Come on. Let's go.
- Let us get out of here.
No..
Let us go from here, Princess.
I want to see this slave dead!
He will not last long
amidst the soldiers of Magadha.
Being a princess,
you cannot be in the common place..
It does not suit your status.
Let us go.
Charioteer, let's go.
I think we should crush the
onions first and then throw them.
Here you go, son.
Look! This is the effort!
A couple of onions
compelled you to shed tears.
"Chandragupta!"
Just think of it.
If some more people join me
we will drown you in your own tears!
Let us go!
"Chandragupta!"
Illusion and reality
are two poles apart.
But a person is not able to comprehend
the time their differences
merge together.
The same happened with the
boy who was made a king for a day.
He mistook an illusion as a reality
and had the audacity to misbehave
with my dearest Durdhara,
the princess of Magadha
in front of my subjects.
I am thinking of making
him a prince for real.
I want to make him eternal.
But Mahamatya, one needs
to die to become eternal, right?
$Yes, Your Highness.
I will make sure to pour
this hot liquid gold on him
and will make him eternal forever!
Go, Mahamatya. Wherever he is hiding
bring him and make
him kneel before me.
Yes, Your Highness.
'For the bright future of the country
it is necessary to have Chandra'
'who, with his zeal, eradicates the problem which has been continuing for years.'
'And I have seen that
zest in Chandragupta, Queen.'
'But to make this possible'
'it is necessary for
Chandragupta to be alive.'
'What is your name?'
'Chandragupta.'
'I know that my son Chandragupta'
'under the guidance of Chanakya'
'very soon will takeover
the throne of Magadha.'
'And then,
it will be Dhananand's end.'
'This person had come to
the princess to solve his problem.'
'But instead of solving the problem'
'you rained lashes on him.'
'Who do you think you are?'
'You are the princess of Magadha.
Not more than that!'
Princess.
Here is your favourite
saffron infused almond dessert.
I.. I do not wish to have anything!
I want that slave to kneel before me!
Oh.. You will also get him.
He must have been caught by now.
We will decide his fate
after going to the palace.
Just enjoy the trip
and this Kheer now.
You are right.
Give it to me.
Thinking about him is a waste of time.
And no one can escape from
my brother Emperor Dhananand.
No one can harm me
as long as he is around me.
Chandra, Dhananand must
have learned about this by now.
I think we better
leave Pataliputra now.
- You just concentrate on your food.
- What!
Planning and strategy..
Leave it to me.
- Chandragupta..
- Chandragupta..
- Save me, Chandra..
- Chandra..
Save me. Chandragupta..
Chandragupta..
Acharya,
I did not understand your trick.
First, you got Princess
Durdhara attacked by your men.
Now, your men are about
to hold Chandra captive
in the guise of Magadha soldiers.
Why are you doing this?
I am preparing the battlefield
in order to train the
future emperor of India.
Acharya, what is your plan?
The one who discloses
his plan before time
gets destroyed.
You will get to know everything
on your own at the right time.
My plan will take
Chandragupta to his destiny.
"He is an experience scholar.."
It will take him to the
throne of the emperor of India.
"He is Chanakya.."
"He is Chanakya.."
Here. Did you not pay
a sum of 2000 units to buy me?
Here is 4000 units for you.
Henceforth, I have only one master
whose name is Emperor Dhananand.

================================================================================

Episode: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12lmoHDgdww

'You do not know what
mistake you are about to do.'
'I am the princess of Magadh.'
'You are inviting your own death.'
Save us. Save us.
The princess is to be blamed
for she has troubled the innocents.
Save us. Save us.
- I hear voices.
- Save us.
Princess Durdhara.
Look there!
Your death is staring at you.
Soldiers, capture them all!
Tie him up!
These soldiers are highly untrained.
Do not you dare step ahead.
- Spare us! Let us go..
- Save us.
- Let us go..
- No..
- Let us go..
- Let us go..
- Save us.
- Let us go..
Let us go.. Let us go..
Let us go.. Let us go..
Let us go.. Let us go..
You cannot escape from here, lady!
You should not even try.
I will tell you what.
Do not dare touch her.
Hey! Take her away!
- Come.
- Shipra!
"Chandragupta."
"Chandragupta."
The food prepared in the
royal kitchen tastes delicious.
But I regret that I will not
be able to taste it because of you.
Try to save yourself too.
What is wrong?
You displayed excellent
swordsmanship back in the palace.
What went wrong here?
How dare you..
Do not dare touch her, slave!
Forgive me.
I was merely following his order.
Forgive me.
Her Highness is generous enough
to consider you as her
friend and not a handmaiden.
But that does not mean
you will not perform your duties.
But I tried my best, Mother.
Why did you not lay down your life?
What if she was harmed?
Madam, she tried really hard.
Attention!
His Majesty Dhananand is here.
Did these slaves accompany
my sister on her trip?
Yes, Your Majesty.
Send all of them
to Seleucus right away
as a gift from Magadh.
Durdhara.. Durdhara, my sister!
Are you all right?
Brother..
I am all right.
I will build a heaven
in the palace for you.
Forest, lake, market..
Everything will be
set up in the palace.
But you will not go out of the palace.
- But.. - You will not go out of the palace without me.
As you wish, Your Majesty.
Hail the emperor!
Your Highness, that slave
has been brought to the assembly.
Brother, even I will accompany you.
Of course.
Punish him so severely
that no slave dares to
cross his limits in future.
Gouge his eyes out
which were raised at
the princess of Magadh.
Do not spare those legs
which go out of this
palace without my permission.
And chop off those hands
which dared to touch a princess.
Decapitate him!
Did you see?
That is why I love my sister so much.
Because her anger and brutality
match with me.
I yearn to punish him like you,
Brother.
Punish him.
You have all the qualities of mine.
But you have not learned
the trick of seeing
the other perspective
of a situation yet.
You want me to gouge his eyes out
which anticipated the attack on you!
You want me to chop his legs
which he used to attack those goons!
And those hands which
saved your life..
How can I chop those
hands off, Sister?
No.. No.. No..
He is the one who
saved my sister's life.
Hence, he deserves a reward,
not punishment.
And he deserves respect as well.
Henceforth, you shall be
my sister's personal bodyguard.
- But Brother..
- No.
I do not want to hear anything.
When the Lord of Magadh
decides on something
nobody can refuse it.
Even if it is my beloved sister.
Kid, go ahead.
Do you have questions too?
'If I accept this proposal'
'the door of the palace
will be open for me permanently.'
'And I will be able
to find my mother.'
'But will I be able to
discharge my duty efficiently?
What happened?
Any problem?
'I had bought you with money'
'and now I sold you,
receiving money in return.'
'Now it is between
you and your new master.'
'Soon I shall free myself
by repaying the amount.'
What inconvenience, your highness?
The emperor's orders are God's command.
And it cannot be ignored.
I was just asking for a little favour
from the mighty one that..
Can't the emperor give
a year's salary to
this slave right now?
The way you present your point
has always impressed me.
Your wish shall
definitely be fulfilled.
But do remember.
Under your watch if even a
strand of my sister is harmed then..
I shall not leave any hair
to be harmed in the first place!
No.. No..
What I meant is as long I am there
I shall not let anything happen
to the delicate princess of Magadh.
You! What are you doing here?
Hey! Veerbhadra's mother, you here!
It is good that I met you.
I had a good news to deliver you.
I have found a job
in this palace itself.
From today, I am the bodyguard
of Princess Durdhara.
What do you say? Is this not amazing?
You shall not take this job.
You should never have come
to the palace then why did you?
Come. Let me tell you of a
secret passage to go from here. Come.
- Lady, first listen..
- There is danger at every corner here.
You have witness His Majesty's
cruelty, have you not?
J-Just run away from here.
But Lady, listen to me for a moment.
It is important for
me to stay in this palace.
I accepted this job because
there is a reason behind this.
Somebody had told me
that my mother..
She lives in this palace.
And it is important for me
to stay in this palace
in order to find her.
Your mother?
'It is imperative for
Chandragupta's safety'
'that you do not reveal
this truth to him now'
'that you are his mother.'
- 'But..
- Chandragupta gets impulsive easily.'
'If he gets to know the truth
then without realising the situation'
'he will do something being emotional'
'that the news will reach
till Dhananand, Queen Mura.'
I don't need to tell you
what will happen after that.
'But, Acharya'
'whenever I see him'
'it becomes very difficult
for me to get a hold on my feelings.'
'A test that is easy is
not worthy of being a test.'
'A mother holds the highest
position in this world.'
'Hence, her test will
be a great one as well.'
Perhaps,
you are under a misconception.
As no mother would want her son
to live in a sinful place.
Here the fate is changed
at every moment like weather.
I am sure
even your mother will want
that you go far from this place.
This love
these thoughts..
This motherly affection.
Belongs to you, Veerbhadra's mother.
But my mother is not like you.
You are an epitome
of love and kindness.
But my mother is cruel
selfish
and a greedy woman.
What?
Yes.
For the greed of a few coins,
my mother had sold me to a hunter.
And stayed in this palace.
To enjoy the grandeur
and glory of this place.
Without thinking
how her son would live
amid the world's
selfishness and cruelty.
My mother snatched my
childhood away for a few coins.
Just for once..
I want to meet her for once.
So that I can look
at her eyes and tell her
that how much
her son hates her.
Forgive us!
Please free us.
Let us go from here.
Forgive us! Please free us.
Forgive us! Please free us.
Forgive us! Please free us.
Forgive us! Please free us.
These are the maids who
stay with Princess Durdhara.
Yes. They are being taken to Seleucus.
As they failed to
protect Princess Durdhara
hence, they are being taken
away from their near ones.
As a punishment.
No. The princess' security
is not the duty of these maids
but of the soldiers.
Then why are they being punished?
No, I shall not let this happen.
No.. Don't.
Stop.. Calm down.
Do not go there if you wish to live.
- But, My Lady..
- Do you not respect me?
Then honour my words.
Do not go there at this moment.
And go away from this palace.
Go far away from this palace.
My Lady
I honoured your one request
but forgive me.
I will not be able to
honour your second request.
I know, My Lady.
That you are worried for me.
And you see me as Veerbhadra.
But I shall not rest
unless I find my mother.
Here. Did you not pay
a sum of 2000 units to buy me?
Here is 4000 units for you.
Henceforth, I have only one master
whose name is Emperor Dhananand.

================================================================================

Episode: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ki73qxCQfH0

You expressed your intention
for creating a united nation.
You said Chandra displays
the traits of a remarkable emperor.
This is the reason why
I could not tell him the truth
despite being so close to him.
I could not shower
my motherly love on him
that waited for 12 years.
Being a mother
I witnessed the murder of
Veerbhadra who was also someone's son
just to provide a
safe exit to my Chandra
and your future emperor,
from the palace.
But you sent him
to that very Dhananand instead.
Acharya!
I hope you know
that his palace is the most condemned
unsafe and sinful place on earth.
This is why I have sent him there.
Now that you have
already met him there
it must be clear to you
that how much he hates you.
Yes, Your Highness.
I knew it from the very start
that Chandragupta hates
his mother to the core.
The person who hates his mother
cannot be turned into
a patriot so easily.
But as he begins to stay in the palace
he will no longer focus
about his hatred for his mother.
Perhaps, he will develop
hatred for the cruel Dhananand
as he will realize
that Dhananand is not fit
to rule over this nation.
Lady, we must know the
root cause of the problem
before finding a solution to it.
Besides,
I want to send him to the palace
and make him realize
how grave a danger Dhananand
poses to the nation.
A sword is to be rubbed
against a stone continuously
to make it sharp.
Your Highness, I told you beforehand
that my goal shall demand sacrifice.
Many shall die for the noble
cause of uniting the nation.
You have to sacrifice
your motherly love for him.
Your son will face
challenges day in day out.
You have to accept it as
a sacrifice from your side.
You belong to the
warrior clan yourself.
You know it very well
that you cannot learn about war by
getting listening or reading about it.
Rather, one has to
fight to learn about war.
A person with a difficult objective
needs to get a hard training.
If Chandragupta has to
lead the country in the future
he must serve as the bodyguard
of that tyrant Dhananand's sister.
His harsh experiences
in the palace will sharpen
Chandragupta's character
so much like this sword
that he can rip that cruel Dhananand
apart when the right time arrives.
Acharya.
Acharya, open the door.
Bhairav, take Lady Mura
out through the backdoor.
Sure, Acharya.
Lady Mura
make sure Chandragupta
does not know that you came here.
Please, leave.
Come.
Acharya, open the door.
Here.
Did youAnot pay a sum
of 2000 units to buy me?
Here is 4000 units for you.
It is double the money
you paid to Lubdhak.
I have settled my debt.
So, I am not entitled to follow
your orders anymore.
Henceforth, I have only one master
whose name is Emperor Dhananand.
Your Highness, as per your orders
we have increased
the palatial security.
But we still could
not find the culprits
who attacked my sister, Minister!
I do not even know
who asked them to do so
and where they are right now.
Your Majesty,
even I want to know that.
I am working on it.
I will soon catch them.
Wait!
Give it a thought, Your Majesty.
Why did the kite attack the python?
That is because the
pythons eat kites' eggs.
The snake must have done the same.
That suggests, people turn
enemies of each other owing
to personal reasons, Your Majesty.
The python tried
to eat the kite's eggs.
Those eggs were not its target,
it was the kite.
That is what deepened their enmity.
Are you saying that the
one who attacked my sister
is my enemy.
Am I right?
You are right, Your Majesty.
'My mother is cruel, selfish'
'and a greedy woman.'
'She sold me to a
hunter for some money.'
'I just want to meet her once
to look into her eyes and tell her'
'that how much I hate her.'
Mura!
So, it's you,
who conspired against my sister!
Just because I killed your son
so in order to take your
revenge you attacked my sister!
I hate you so much
that I would not have attacked
Durdhara and wasted my time.
I would have pierced
a sword through your heart.
But it is a matter of delight
that there are others as well
who hate you.
They want to hurt you.
It is even more delighting
that you hardly know who they are.
Perhaps, they did not leave
behind any evidence.
It is extremely difficult for you
to identify them.
Perhaps, they are living
here as your friend.
'Till the time political
motives are the same'
'allies support each other.'
'Different motives
turn allies into enemies.'
'May our aim always stay the same'
'such that we do not hurt each other.'
Clean it up.
A small doubt is enough
to burn down an entire kingdom,
Dhananand.
Thank you, Acharya Chanakya
for teaching me how to use
Dhananand's doubt on me against him.
There are more than
500 rooms in the palace.
If I search each and
every room for my mother
it will take me more than 1.5 years.
"He is Chanakya.."
"He is Chanakya.."
"He is Chanakya.."
"He is Chanakya.."
There is a rule in slavery.
In order to set
yourself free from debt
you have to pay your
master to his heart's content.
I did not set you free from Lubdhak
because I was greedy for money.
I wanted you to perform
a special task for me.
The only possible way
to escape from your clutches
is to tell His Majesty
your hiding place.
That way,
I will receive a prize from him
and set myself free from you.
That is indeed a great thought.
I advise you to approach him
right away without wasting much time.
Rather, I should accompany you.
Let us go.
I bow to you.
Long live His Majesty.
Seleucus has sent
you this return gift.
He has sent a message as well.
He says, he is delighted
to use the handmaidens
sent to him as a gift by you.
Take a look, Your Highness.
It is not just a gift but a sign
that he always wants
to be your close ally.
'He is like a snake'
'who has not shed his skin.'
'And like a friend
he is standing beside you.'
Your Majesty.
Why did you do this?
We had an opportunity
to be friends with Seleucus.
Burning his gifts will attract
enmity from him, Your Highness.
Mahamatya,
perhaps the shine of this gift
has deprived you of the
vision of what lies in the future.
That is why you are
not able to apprehend
that our enemy
has sounded the conch of battle.
By attacking my sister,
our enemy has made their move.
Now, I will make my move.
We need to be alert, Mahamatya.
Anybody can be our enemy.
Even Seleucus.
He was the one who dreamt
of reigning this kingdom.
Maybe he is the one who is our enemy
in the garb of a friend.
Alert your informers, Mahamatya.
Find out what is going
on in the mind of Seleucus.
No need to worry, Your Majesty.
This monk is so strange.
He was not startled by my threats.
If I tell the emperor
about his hideout
then I will not be responsible
for what he goes through.
It seems you are
thinking properly now.
I know you came to apologise to me.
Okay. I will not disclose
your hideout to the emperor
but on one condition.
It would be good if you
do not interfere in my work.
The wealth I gave you..
Use that for your leisurely journey
and find a new future
emperor for Bharat.
Goodbye.
I did not come here to
bid adieu to you, Chandragupta.
I have come here to go on
a journey with you to the palace.
Even I have to convey an
important message to the emperor.
If I come with you
then my task will become easy.
I see.
But what important information
do you have on you.
I only want to tell the emperor
that what is your motive
in accepting his proposal.
Yes, Chandragupta.
I very well know
that the 4000 coins
you have brought with you
has been given by Emperor Dhananand.
I even know well
why you accepted to become the
bodyguard of the sister of Dhananand.
So that you could search
for your mother without hindrance,
staying at Dhananand's palace.
The way the soldiers
of Magadh are after you
it seems that as soon as
you appear before the emperor
your head will be
severed from your body.
But if my goal remains incomplete
even then this life of
mine will have no meaning.
Even if I am not alive
there are people who can
convey your truth to Dhananand.
Really?
And who are they?
Look.
Being my friends,
how can you go against me
and support this crazy monk?
Their silence is telling you,
what they will do.
If you want to be free from me
then you need to inform
me of all the activities
taking place in palace of Dhananand.
After getting relieved off your duties
when you return from the royal palace
then you will elaborately tell me
the activities which
took place there for the day.
By the way..
Every night I will be giving
you a task which you have to complete.
Chandragupta,
now it all depends on you..
Do you want to be free from
me by passing the information to me
or do you want to give up your life
by revealing your secret to Dhananand.
You have a cunning mind, Brahmin.
You managed to get the best of me,
my friends
and even the emperor Dhananand.
It will definitely take some time.
But soon Chandra's glory
will put an end to this evil reign.

================================================================================

If you do not want to become
the future emperor of Bharat
even I will not disturb you,
Chandragupta.
I will fulfill my dream
with somebody else's help.
You will only be an informer for me.
And yes, I will give
you a task every night
which you must fulfill.
Chandragupta,
it is now up to you to decide
if you want to give me
the information and free yourself
or get yourself exposed
before Dhananand
and lose your life.
I see.
So, you are the one
who laid this whole trap.
Princess Durdhara got attacked
and I reached there at the same time
and the attackers ran
away that very moment.
It was your plan
to make me enter the palace.
Right.
All this was a part of my plan.
You are very smart.
I heard about hitting
two birds with one stone.
But you hit the whole Magadha,
all at once.
You outsmarted me,
Lubdhak, Princess Durdhara
my friends, and even King Dhananand?
Shall I take your appreciation
as an agreement to my offer?
You have not left
me with any other option.
I accept.
I will go to the palace
and pass on the information
and also perform every task for you,
every night.
But how would I be sure
that you will not tell anyone
about my presence in the palace?
It is a deal, Chandragupta.
If you safeguard my secret
even I will safeguard yours.
Are you happy now?
Your new friend will not
be in any problem because of me.
Goodbye!
"Chandragupta.."
"Chandragupta.."
Acharya, we are surely helping you.
But Chandra and the three of us
have been together like
a family since our childhood
during thick and thin.
And today, we are against him.
We are finding this very bad.
Right, Acharya.
We are helping you
only because even we think
that Chandragupta will surely
do something great in life.
No doubt!
Chandragupta will surely
do something very great.
He will do it not only for
himself but for the whole Bharat too.
It will surely take some
time to shake off his adamance.
"Chandragupta Maurya!"
And soon after that
the Chandragupta's bright light
which will emanate from him
destroy the darkness of oppression.
"Chandragupta Maurya!"
Hi, friend!
Why do you look so serious?
This is the first day of my work.
Ask me my name and introduce yourself.
After all
understanding our
peers is very important.
What do you say?
You can take the introduction later.
Because His Highness has called you.
Come.
Your Highness..
A-As per
your command
I am here.
Chandragupta, I hope you remember
that you are going to safeguard
the most favourite and
valuable pearl of my life.
My sister's safety
is your responsibility.
It is not your job
but your responsibility.
And responsibility
demands sacrifice too.
So you must take an oath,
before you accept this responsibility.
And you must sacrifice
something dear to you
so that you always remember your oath.
You must part with something
that is priceless to you
and one that belongs only to you
and to no one else!
'Now what does this
mad tyrant want from me?'
'Can it be an organ of mine?
My hands or my head?'
'No!'
'I cannot keep his sister safe'
'if I were to lose my head
or my hands, so what is it?'
All these locks..
They belong to the ones whom I trust
and they are all bound
to their duties towards me.
You must be thinking
why I take the locks?
Am I right?
I take the locks because..
As the locks
are a symbol of a person's
pride and a marker of one's identity.
Women of beauty
take pride in their tresses.
It is these locks that if pulled
can drag one's persona
along with them!
You must have heard
that Kaurava were ruined
as they had mocked Draupadi's hair.
Just for some locks Kaurava
dynasty was destroyed.
You have heard of it, right?
When does a person go bald?
It happens when one loses one's father
or the head of their family.
Parting with your hair simply means
that you accept a responsibility.
And hence by giving your locks
you've accepted the duty
of keeping Durdhara safe.
Holding them as witness
your past, present and future
will take an oath, right here.
To keep my sister safe.
Holding this drenched lock as witness,
you must pledge.
Repeat after me, I, Chandragupta..
I hold Emperor Dhananand
and my clan as witness and I swear
that I will never betray Magadha.
I will always protect
the throne of Magadha.
And I will uphold the
honour of Magadha Empire.
From this moment on I will
strive as a trusted servant
and I am bound by oath
to serve towards my duty.
'Give me your word..'
'I, Chandragupta,
accept my duties as a spy.'
'That I will spy on
the Empire of Magadha.'
'I will spy on the Emperor
and all of his kin.'
'I will uphold my duties as a guard
but my loyalty is not towards them.'
'My actions may be for Dhananand'
'but my code and duty
lies towards Acharya Chanakya.'
You must swear that keeping my sister
safe will be your foremost duty.
And in the line of this duty
even if you have to die or kill
then you will show no hesitation.
From here on you have only one goal
to keep my sister safe.
'Give me your word.'
'That you will always
be cautious as a spy.'
'That you will not let
Dhananand or any of his kin'
'even sense who you truly are.'
'Your objective to keep
Princess Durdhara safe'
'is merely a means to
maintain your cover as a spy.'
Say it.
That you are no longer a simpleton.
You will only be answerable
to the Emperor.
It will be your duty to inform me
if you encounter anything
that spawns against me.
You will not hesitate
to inform me and alert me
against traitors and
enemies of the crown.
From this moment on
you will not allow
any rebellion to grow.
'Give me your word.'
'That you will be my eyes and ears.'
'That you will inform
me of every action'
'that Dhananand takes
for and against Magadha.'
What is the matter?
I have never seen you so quiet before.
Can it be that
the oath takes you on a path
different than your motive?
Answer me!
Hail Emperor Dhananand!
Is this an acceptable answer
my Lord?
Bhadrasaal.
He is ready.
Tell him of his duties..
Yes, my Lord.
Acharya.
What is all this?
We thought we were making
an arena for Chandragupta.
And you needed us to help.
But there are no weapons in here.
There is no sword,
no dagger nor any bow or arrows.
How will Chandragupta
train in such conditions?
Who told you that
weapons are necessary
if one has to train
in skills of combat?
Please stop with the riddles, Acharya.
Please tell us of what
you have prepared for..
By seeing all these arrangements
we do not understand..
How will these wooden planks,
pots full of water
and the viper kept
in the basket over there
along with these ladders,
help Chandra become great?
Please tell us.
What sort of a training is this?
It is fine.
If you do not wish to answer us,
you may not.
But when Chandra returns
from the palace at night
then he will ask
you countless questions
and believe us, when we say this.
He will not work for
you till he has his answers.
I know well the
stubbornness of your friend.
And thus,
to train him, I will break him first.
You are welcome to try.
You have my best wishes.
That is all the bread I get?
Only two pieces?
Where is the rest of it?
Where is the last piece?
Acharya,
where is my third piece of bread?
I had told you that
I will pace my meals.
But you..
You took my portions from me.
You want a piece of bread?
Agreed. You may take it.
You there! It is mine! Give it back!
That is mine!
Stop!
Or else I will have
to inform the authorities.
It seems that along
with the royal insignia
you have also imbibed
the qualities and the loyalty
of your ill master.
Listen to me, Mother of Veerbhadra.
I understand your pain.
That your son was killed
right in front of you
but even so, I suggest
that you must not
act against the Emperor
and land yourself in trouble.
I will not tell anyone
of what happened today
but be cautious in the future.
Do not forget.
You do not have the might
to oppose the Lord of Magadha.
This sword that you
wear by your side..
The blacksmith struck
it countless times to forge it.
And by those strikes,
the sword became so mighty.
And in a similar manner
these small sparks of rebellion
will soon become a raging fire.
And you shall see
this curse of mine will end Dhananand.
I am Vishnugupta Chanakya.
Acharya is the one that guides
the students by his own actions.
It is said that we
learn from experiences.
But it is not necessary
that they must be ours.
Since if we were to learn
everything as we experience it
then a lifespan will fall too short.
Hence we have legacies and history.
History of those ancestors
whose experiences teach us.
I will teach you
the most bitter lessons
that I have learnt
from my experiences.
But why am I teaching you?
Because the nation always
needs people like Chandragupta
who who can keep the
nation united and mighty.
Ones that act towards
the glory of nation.
I want every child of Bharat
to be like Chandragupta Maurya.
One that has courage and wisdom.
One who has brain and brawn.
And who is a great
blade of wisdom and might.
So that every threat
to the nation is countered.
So be ready to take lessons
and to pave your own path.
My lessons and your actions.
An ordinary boy who
has not grown up yet
got more respect than
you from the king, Shamandev.
How can a person who cannot
fight for his rights, can protect me?
I will definitely fight for my rights.

This sword that you
wear by your side..
The blacksmith struck
it countless times to forge it.
And by those strikes,
the sword became so mighty.
And in a similar manner
these small sparks of rebellion
will soon become a raging fire.
And you shall see
this curse of mine will end Dhananand.
Lady, I have told you earlier too
that I am not interested
in somebody's victory or defeat.
I will bow down and work here.
And I will look for my mother.
Tell me, where should I begin from
to look for my mother?
You are very close to the king, right?
Ask him.
It is my fault
that I asked a question
to a mother who was sad.
Shall I say something, Lady?
The stains of blood
can never be washed.
You are wasting your time and energy
by washing these clothes.
Wash it with water
and put it for drying.
There is no need to work so hard.
You are right, Chandragupta.
The stains of blood
can never be washed.
You do not know that I am your mother.
But you can
still sense my pain.
I can clearly see worry for me
in your eyes.
And I will watch Dhananand's defeat
in these eyes someday.
Chop them into more smaller pieces.
Smaller. Smaller. More smaller.
Once these small pieces
of onion mix with the spices
it will lose its
smell and taste, right?
Yes, Your Majesty.
That is why we try to make sure
that the onion is
not chopped very finely
so that it does not
lose its smell and taste.
What did you learn from this, Amatya?
That Seleucus will
always attack secretly
so that we do not get any indication.
When the attack is a big one
it leaves behind an
evidence and indication
and the enemy's name gets revealed.
Your Majesty,
when the attack is a smaller one..
For example, a protest by a farmer
we do not even think
about the enemy there.
But doing this will hurt
your fame and reputation
and Seleucus's name
will also not be revealed.
Good.
Good.
The farmer who stopped Durdhara's
blood was cultivating onions, right?
Yes, Your Majesty.
Before these chopped
onions bring tears in my eyes
let us fry them.
This is what will happen,
Your Majesty.
An ordinary boy who
has not grown up yet
got more respect than
you from the king, Shamandev.
Shamandev, who has been
my bodyguard from five years.
That boy will take
your respect and you..
You are quiet.
Surprising!
Isn't your bravery and
your self-respect provoking you?
This is the king's challenge,
Princess.
How can I go against this?
After listening to your thoughts
I think the king's decision was right.
How can a person who
cannot fight for his rights
can rotect me?
Shamandev,
do your veins contain blood or water?
Princess, not blood,
but courage flows in my veins.
And I have given a proof
of the same from time to time.
You are absolutely right.
I was quiet to follow
the king's order.
But not anymore.
Now, I will definitely
fight for my rights.
You have now spoken like a brave man.
Go and fight for your rights.
You will emerge victorious.
Why are you doing this, Princess?
You are going against your own brother
and the king of Magadha, Dhananand.
I am the only person in this world
whose biggest mistake
is also forgiven by the king.
But that servant has
entered my premises now.
The king not just forgave
him for his mistakes
but he honoured him too.
I cannot tolerate this, Shipra.
I will not let a situation arise
where that servant can be equal to me.
Just wait and watch
how I get rid of the
obstacle from my life.
Amazing!
Did you see my painting?
Is there anybody in this
world who is more beautiful than me?
Why are you looking at me like that?
I am Princess Durdhara's bodyguard.
I am doing my duty.
I know.
But you are not aware that
I am the princess' old bodyguard.
Really?
I'm happy to meet you.
Shall I go now?
You can go.
But give us our swords before going.
I have heard that you
were a servant earlier.
So, you must be aware
how to obey the orders.
The kid is not able
to carry the weight.
Come on, let us reduce his burden.
If you want to enter the palace
then you must first defeat me.
So that I can be assured that
you're worthy of this post, or not.
All of you are making a mistake.
The king himself has appointed
me for this position.
And we want to prove to the king
that how can a person
who cannot protect himself
can protect the princess?
Good.
That is amazing.
Dhananand,
something is disturbing my mind
and that matter is
related to Durdhara.
What happened to my sister?
Durdhara's safety is the
most important task of Magadha.
And you have assigned
that duty to a small boy.
To a servant who has no experience.
He does not know how to use the sword.
I agree that he does
not know how to use the sword.
But he is sharper than the sword.
He may not have experience.
But he is brave and fearless.
He is ordinary.
But he has an extraordinary spirit.
Whenever he becomes aggressive
he does not walk. He flies.
He might be a servant today.
But his personality
has the traits of a leader.
He knows how to lead.
Nanny, I had two options
after what he had done.
First, I should kill him.
But if I would do that
his talent and heroism
would go in vain.
Second, I should have punished him.
By doing so, he would emerge
as my strongest enemy in future.
And perhaps
would stand with his army.
Dhananand..
You are giving too much
importance to that slave.
That is the difference
between you and I.
Foresight.
You do not possess the qualities
of foresightedness like I do.
And hence I am up here
and you, down at my feet.
A diamond has such qualities that
when it is in the hands of the enemy
it can be a weapon against us
and if it is with us,
it can be a piece of adornment.
If such a skilled and talented boy
receives improper guidance
he can go against me
and so, I made him mine!
Now, he will still fight
but for me.
I must personally watch this boy
and keep him very close to me.
Because one must keep his
shield closer to him than his sword.
If this boy is guided the way I want
he will shield me and
if guided by someone else
he will attack me instead.
But what if he does
not meet your expectations?
Oh, Lady! Why?
Why ask questions the answers
to which you already know?
You do not have to worry just yet.
That boy will surely find
a way to handle the situation
with his skills and intelligence.
"Chandragupta!"
"Chandragupta!"
Moments ago
the King of Magadha made me promise
that being your bodyguard
I must protect you before my own self.
I request you not
to create a situation
due to which I regret
putting my life at stake
for an arrogant,
selfish, rude and egoistic girl.
It seems you do not know
what is going to happen to
the one who behaved inappropriately
with me the last time.
Yes!
You are right.
The same farmer who
threw onions in my path.
Pardon my son!
Have mercy! Let me go!
Please let me go! Please..
Do not kill him.
Please, do not kill him.
You may punish me the way you want.
No! No! Have mercy, Your Highness.
Forgive my son.
'It seems you do not know'
'what is going to happen to
the one who behaved inappropriately'
'with me the last time.'
You?
Look, dear, these men brought
my son here to kill him.
Ask the King to pardon him.
He is all I have right now.
Stop them from killing my son.
Always speak the truth.
Always lead a simple life.
You must've been hearing
about this since childhood.
But.. I'd like to add
that besides leading a simple life
you should also be careful.
The trees that are
firm and stand upright
fall first when there's
a storm or are attacked by humans
but the ones who know
how to bow down in such cases
survive the catastrophe.
It is correct to stick
to the path of righteousness.
But to protect yourself
you must be able to
change yourself with time.
You should learn to be more careful.
A little bit of salt in butter
doesn't spoil the butter.
In fact it prevents the butter
from getting spoiled from going bad.
Similarly a truthful and simple person
must act carefully
and wisely.
Imbibe this quality and
your fate will change on its own.
The advice is mine
but the fate will be yours.
Every farmer of
Pataliputra must be there
to witness the death
of that particular farmer.
I will be present there
to see that farmer die.
You cannot do this, my Lord.

================================================================================

Episode: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHT3Qlg-OTU

Splendid!
It is a delicious meal.
Bhadrasaal, you must ensure
every farmer of Pataliputra
must be there to witness
the death of that particular farmer
So that no one else dares
stand against Emperor and Magadha!
Certainly, Councillor.
It will be done as
you have instructed.
My Lord.
Would you like to go to the execution?
No.
But you must tell him that,
I ate the onions from his field.
And convey my thanks to him.
Yes, my Lord.
You cannot do this, my Lord.
I know, my Lord, that you are angry
since a simple farmer
spoke against your sister.
But that poor farmer had no choice.
If you kill him today
then what would happen
to his poor mother
and to his kids, my Lord?
They will starve to death.
Councillor.
I have changed my mind.
I will be present there to
see that farmer die and along with me
Chandragupta will be there.
Splendid!
Forgive me!
Forgive me, I was enraged!
I made a mistake!
Please forgive me!
Please spare my life.
Come forth, Chandragupta.
Look what happens
to him at my mere signal.
Forgive me!
Forgive me, I was enraged!
I made a mistake!
No! Please stop!
Just one mre step
and your head will
be severed from your body.
- Father!
- My son!
- Father..
- Do not kill him!
Let go off my father.
- Let him go.
- Save me! Help me!
Forgive me, my Lord. Forgive me.
Save me! Help me!
- Enjoy it, Chandragupta.
- Forgive me, my Lord!
- Forgive me.
- And let that farmer enjoy too.
Save me! Help me!
A farmer has immense
love for the land.
The soil.
It is by this soil
that he grows his crops.
And now in this very
soil he will be buried.
His very form will reduce to soil.
Forgive me, my Lord.
I made a mistake!
I am giving him a chance
to unite with the soil.
Even the scriptures say
that a body is made from soil
and the to the dust we
return and it is no punishment
but a reward.
To be united to your origin.
Witness this, Chandragupta.
This farmer will experience great joy.
Witness this!
A farmer tills the land
but this farmer has gone beyond
and given his own body to the soil.
A crop that is infested
with pests is burned.
And the seeds are discarded.
But I..
I will not his sacrifice go to waste.
And now the crop that grows from here
will not be infested
by the malice of rebellion.
And where there is no rebellion
the ruler and the Kingdom
always stay safe.
- Hail Emperor Dhananand!
- Hail!
- Hail Emperor Dhananand!
- Hail!
- Hail Emperor Dhananand!
- Hail!
- Hail Emperor Dhananand!
- Hail!
- Hail Emperor Dhananand!
- Hail!
- Hail Emperor Dhananand!
- Hail!
I hate the very thought of rebellion
and rebellious people, Chandragupta.
And hence forth do not
walk the path of revolution.
You are dear to me and I will
hate to sacrifice something
that is dear to me.
My dear son!
Acharya!
Do you know what
that tyrant did today?
He buried a farmer alive!
And that farmer had only asked
for a fair price for his produce!
All he asked was justice!
I do not know what
will happen to his family..
To his old mother..
What will become of his
children who depended on him?
It seems as if their lives
are devoid of joy.
His mother sought help
from me to save her son
but I failed!
Just as Emperor Dhananand
killed the Prince of Piplivan
right in front of my eyes!
What is the matter?
Acharya? Why are you silent?
You were speaking
of great many things.
One's love for the motherland.
A united Bharat! A rebellion!
Do you not feel any rage
hearing of the farmer's death?
Acharya.
You are strange.
How can you write in such dark void?
Darkness only takes away your sight.
It cannot take away our vision.
And hence I can write
even in darkness.
But for now you lack
the vision that is
unaffected by darkness.
No need to be worried.
I will guide you.
Walk five paces straight ahead and
you will find your meal and a blanket.
Take it and leave from here.
"A vision that seeks
betterment of all."
"A mighty wisdom that
comes from great experience."
"One that always acts as the beacon."
"He is Chanakya.."
Grandmother, I am famished.
Forgive me, kids.
I cannot feed you tonight.
No one will stay hungry, old one.
You!
Forgive me, Elder.
I could not save your son.
I had sent Chandragupta to Dhananand's
palace with a certain intent in mind
and I can see it working
from the very first day.
That is it.
A few more days in that palace
and Chandragupta will
see that he must rise
to save countless such mothers.
In order to be the saviour
for the countless mothers
he must prove his
worth to the motherland!
He must protect his motherland
before he protects others.
"The greatest tactician
and the wisest of all."
Greetings, my Lord.
Councillor.
Here I present the finest
of wine from Magadha.
So tell me.
Which one should be presented
to our special guest?
Splendid, my Lord.
So what do you think?
The wine that you just tasted..
Would that be great to
serve in front of Seleucus?
Seleucus?
But he is a suspect behind
the attack on Durdhara.
And my spies have been
monitoring him closely.
But we have not found
any strong evidence yet.
And hence I have decided
that I will invite Seleucus
and he will be welcomed
in a grand manner
that no one has witnessed ever before.
I do not understand, my Lord.
You do not have to.
The ploy regarding Seleucus
is safe in my head.
And you must ensure
that no one knows
of this in the palace
and that everyone is preparing
for his grand welcome.
As you command, my Lord.
Councillor, are the gardens of Magadha
blooming with only white roses?
I have been seeing
this since the morning
as every attendant
is holding a white rose.
What is the meaning of this?
This..
This is the mark of loyalty
towards you, my Lord.
After seeing that traitor farmer die
they are all fearing you even more.
And thus they will offer
a white rose to your statue
to show their loyalty towards you.
But Councillor,
when I am present right here
why do they honour my statue?
I understand, my Lord.
And hence I like you, youngling.
You imbibe a lesson well.
Unlike the others who fail to learn
even after repeated torment.
Mura.
Why do you not come forth?
Come beneath my feet
and swear your loyalty to me.
There it is. She lowers her gaze.
Nursemaid!
She, who is from warrior clan,
lowers her gaze!
It seems that all of
her pride and arrogance
has died along with her son!
Next!
'Dhananand will not
forgive her so easily.'
'He will punish her, for certain.'
In order to grow a tree,
we choose the finest of seeds.
Since it is the seed that ensures
the tree will be a great banyan
or a thorny shrub!
But the very existence of the tree
is ensured by the soil, the ground
where the seed shall sprout.
If the soil is barren,
the seed will wither
and if the soil is saline
the plant will end up a sapling.
So it relies on the soil
which seed shall rise
as a great banyan in future
and grant residence to
many and shade to countless.
And such is the bond
amidst a King and his people.
If the King is the seed,
the people are the soil.
If you wish for a great
rule from a great ruler
then the people must be on guard.
They just keep working.
Since the King is amongst them.
So we do not need to have
expectations from the ruler
but we need to test our abilities.
A lesson from me. An action from you.
You'd shed a drop of my blood,
didn't you?
Now, I will drain all
the blood from your body.
After that,
you will not be able to even walk.

Oh, Acharya.. You'll have to wait
for whatever it is
that you want to say.
I don't have anything to say.
I just want to know one thing.
Did any such thing
happen in the palace
that I should be aware of?
No. Nothing unusual.
May I leave now?
Acharya, I'm very tired.
I need to take rest.
You can rest
but before that you must
complete tonight's task.
I'm..
All right!
What do you want?
What task do I have to complete?
Come.
Come, Chandragupta.
You must transfer the
water from this tub to that one
with the help of this vessel.
Take it.
Acharya? Look at me.
Do I look like an idiot
that I'd transfer the water
from this tub to that
one with this small vessel?
I won't do this.
You don't like being
indebted to anyone.
Didn't you say that to me?
Besides I have done
you a very big favour.
Isn't it?
What favour are you talking about?
Why don't take the
gold that I'd offered you?
Gold doesn't have
to do anything with it.
I'm talking about the promise.
Complete the task.
I must make an appointment
for you with a royal physician.
You need to get yourself checked up.
There's something wrong
with your mental health.
First he told me that he'd
make me a king but he made me a spy.
And now when everyone is sleeping he's
making me perform this silly task.
Hey!
Hey, Acharya!
This vessel has a hole in it.
Water is leaking out of it.
Give me another vessel.
Oh..
Completing the task with
this will be very difficult.
But there's no other way.
You must use this. Take it.
But how will I do it?
Half of the water leaks
out as soon as I fill it.
It'll take me the entire
night to fill this tub.
Control and persistence
are two such qualities
that can solve any problem.
You are not performing
the task properly.
When you filled this vessel with water
you filled only half of it.
If you fill this vessel
completely with water
you'll have half of it left
when you reach the other tub.
What! I should fill it up complete!
Look at it for once.
It is so heavy.
If I fill this up completely
it will become even heavier.
- Hold this.
- Is it heavier than the sword
that you'd failed to pick
up against the royal guards?
But.. How do you know?
It's because you are using your
left hand more than your right hand.
It's clear on seeing your sword
that you've not used it today.
There's no point in staring at me,
Chandragupta.
If you start performing
the task right now
I'm sure you'll be able
to finish in before dawn.
But if you try to
understand my intentions
it will take you years to do so.
"He is Chanakya.."
Get on with the work.
Toofan, every time I feel restless,
I come to you
because you guide
me on the right path.
I'm feeling restless today as well.
I killed Mura's husband.
I killed her son before her eyes.
I made her a slave
despite she being a queen.
I humiliated and tortured her..
but her arrogance
doesn't seem to give way.
Her gaze pierces my body
like any sharp weapon would.
What shall I do, Toofan
so that I can shatter her
arrogance forever?
Calm down.. Calm down, Toofan..
Calm down.
If you continue to disregard my orders
I'll not spare you.
After that your body will
just be a cold piece of meat.
Quiet!
Wonderful!
No sooner than sensing danger
you calmed down.
Toofan!
Were you trying to
help me solve my problem?
I must do the same with Mura as well.
I must subject her
to so much physical torture
that her arrogance and
pride shatter into pieces.
She is my biggest enemy
inside the palace, isn't she?
So I must make her complete
all the arrangements
to welcome my biggest foreign enemy.
All by her own.
His biggest enemy..
Who can it be?
Hey.. What do you think?
Did Acharya go off to sleep?
Yes, he's sleeping.
Let us go and help Chandra.
These rotis..
I kept these to eat in the morning.
Give these to me.
I know this is your share of food.
But you have violated the rules
by trying to help Chandragupta.
But, Acharya, I..
You will not get
food tomorrow afternoon.
- But I..
- You will not get food even tonight.
But, Acharya, please tell
us what Chandragupta will gain
by performing this task.
[Sanskrit shlok]
[Sanskrit shlok]
[Sanskrit shlok]
First of all, I will make
him try repeatedly like a crow.
So that his hands can become powerful
by filling water in this pitcher
and pouring it out repeatedly.
So that he can be calm.
So the he becomes calm and patient.
And these qualities will
come in handy for him in future.
"He is Chanakya.."
"He is Chanakya.."
Remember one thing.
The more you sweat during training
the less blood you'll
lose during wars.
"He is Chanakya.."
- Hail the Emperor Dhananand!
- All hail!
- Hail the Emperor Dhananand!
- All hail!
- Hail the Emperor Dhananand!
- All hail!
- Hail the Emperor Dhananand!
- All hail!
- Hail the Emperor Dhananand!
- All hail!
- Hail the Emperor Dhananand!
- All hail!
- Hail the Emperor Dhananand!
- All hail!
- Hail the Emperor Dhananand!
- All hail!
- Hail the Emperor Dhananand!
- All hail!
- Hail the Emperor Dhananand!
- All hail!
I would like to make
a special announcement.
I am going to host a special
guest in my palace very soon.
The road leading to the palace
should be cleaned
and decorated properly.
Considering the grandness
of such occasions
every time, I allow my subjects
to contribute their labour for
a short period of time on daily basis.
But today..
It is my order that
none of my subjects
will do this task.
A woman will do the entire task.
No one else will do this task.
All of you see this woman carefully.
No one will help her.
If anyone helps her he
will be considered a traitor.
And everyone knows what
the punishment of a traitor is.
Bhadrasaal, make sure
that she gets everything
that is required to
clean and decorate the road.
At least, she deserves this help.
Mura, you were a queen.
You know very well
what kind of treatment pleases a king
and how everything is
decorated during his visit.
Remember one thing.
My special guest should be treated
with utmost respect.
You pierced me with a thorn, right?
I lost a drop of blood.
Now, I will take my revenge
by making you suffer.
After that,
you will not be able to even walk.
Make it fast!
Hand the cleaning
materials to this slave.
She has to fix up this
mess as soon as possible.
Do not stare at me, lady.
I hope you understood
His Highness's words.
Get to work if you want to live.
'If Chandragupta
takes notice of me here'
'he will treat me the same
way he'd treated that farmer.'
'He may bring trouble for himself by
making Dhananand unhappy if helps me.'
'I will not let him notice me.'
My friend!
It is you, Bhadrasar!
Why have they gathered here?
What are these decorations
and arrangements for?
Are we expecting someone?
Your job is to protect
the princess, lad.
Mind your own business.
You need not interfere in my work,
or else..
Are you an ironsmith, my friend?
Do you really have to threaten
me with that sword of yours?
You need not get upset.
I was leaving anyway.
Lady!
Where did she disappear?
'Oh, God! How will I save myself from
not getting noticed by Chandragupta?'
Dormant fear helps
protect our lives.
But if it overwhelms us
it may put our lives in danger.
Snake is the most dangerous
animal in this world.
But you must also know
that it is the most timid animal.
It stays hidden and
lurks in the bushes.
It never exposes itself.
What is amazing is the fact
that not all species
of it are poisonous.
Not everyone gets bitten by it.
Despite that,
everybody is afraid of it.
Why so?
That is because it hisses.
That's how,
it takes advantage of the fear
it creates in the
minds of its predators.
This is how it keeps itself safe.
Being scared is not a bad thing.
But never let your enemy know
that you are afraid
because not every battle
is fought physically.
Some of them can be won by faking it.
That is my advice to you.
It is up to you to follow it or not.
He sat on your horse,
Toofan, and left.
He did not even take
anyone's permission.
Are you not afraid of me?
Are you not afraid of death?

================================================================================

Episode: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJBjSM3eK94

You are assigned to
protect the Princess, guard.
Mind your own business.
Do not meddle with my duty or else..
No need to be enraged.
I was just leaving.
Maiden!
Where has she gone?
Maiden?
I was right here.
I was cleaning up.
'I thank heavens that
Chandragupta did not see me.'
Calm down, Toofan!
He is coming.
Ones who do not know how to swim
must not jump in rough stream.
Princess Durdhara.
If you do not know how to ride a horse
then what are you doing here?
If you had been hurt
I would lose my life
as I am your guard.
Spare me the sermon.
Try riding this beast
and then I will admit.
What is the matter?
I knew you cannot do this.
It seems that I must ask the Emperor
to have you assigned
as a court jester. Tell me?
I will ride this horse
and I will tame it.
One does not need a
mirror to wear bracelet.
Why do you not simply prove it?
'Patience and consistency
are two key elements'
'that can tackle even
the greatest of crisis.'
"Chandragupta! Chandragupta!"
"Chandragupta!"
Now that I am seated
on this majestic beast
I will complete an
urgent task of mine.
I am leaving.
I shall meet you soon.
He has won yet again.
By defeating you.
No, Shipra.
His end is nigh.
He does not know
what this act entails.
He rides a steed that
is dear to the Emperor.
No one apart from Emperor
ever sits on the steed
and what will the Emperor do to him
once he knows the truth!
You.
What are you doing here?
Why is that? What did you think, Lady?
That you can hide from
me behind the bangles mart?
You are quite bold.
It is good.
And you are equally silly.
Had you not pricked Emperor back then
you would not be here hiding.
I do not like being advised
nor I have will to hear one.
You must go back
to where you came from.
There is something
alike in you and me.
You are as adamant
and bold just as I am.
Now step aside and let me do this.
No! I must do this all alone.
If Dhananand knows of this he will..
Who will tell him?
There are no guards here.
Look at the people around.
They are his eyes.
Anyone of them will rat us out.
I, Chandragupta
will help this woman here.
But I do not do this to
defy the Lord or as a rebel.
This is just humanity and I heed to it
since I believe
this is atrocity and torment.
And even now if anyone amongst
you wishes to inform the Emperor
then please go forth and pray tell him
that I have defied his rule.
It is done now.
Come, sit here.
Lady, now that we are
done here why will I rest?
You just said that I am quite adamant
and if you do not listen
to me and come sit there
I will not let you go.
All right. Let us go.
You must be hungry.
Please eat something.
Forgive me.
I only have this bread for you.
Please stay quiet, Lady.
Let me enjoy.
These are so delicious.
You must have prepared
this meal thinking of your son.
It must be so painful
and agonising for you.
Yes.
I was hurt deeply.
A moment of pain, so it was.
And now when I meet a son like you
All my pain goes away
Lady, tell me something.
For whose grand welcome
are these preparations done?
An enemy of Dhananand is coming.
One who is deemed special.
An enemy from a distant land.
What a strange man
is Emperor Dhananand!
He buries his own people alive
and he welcomes his
enemy in such a manner?
On guard! Stand fast!
Commander Bhadrasaal has arrived!
Such elaborate preparations
in such less time?
It is not possible for one maiden.
Who is the one that helped this lady?
Who dares defy the royal command?
'No more being the saviour!'
'Even if one person speaks
up I will be in great peril.
Who went against the royal orders?
Look at us, Commander.
Who amongst us will be
eager to lose his or her life?
No one amongst us helped her.
Yes.. All of us were watching.
Yes.. Everything was done by her.
Yes, my Lord.. She did everything..
Let us go, my friend.
The princess would be eagerly waiting.
Let us go.
My friend
I do not why but I like you a lot.
I wish to keep you with me.
Both of us will be close friends.
Did you see, Brother?
This is what I was telling you.
He sat on your horse,
Toofan, and left.
He did not even take
anyone's permission.
Please forgive me, Your Highness.
I did not know that
this horse belongs to you.
He is lying! He knew everything.
He just wanted to prove
that he can ride the king's horse.
A slap cannot change the truth,
Your Highness.
One slap cannot change the truth,
Your Highness.
Princess fell down the
horse while trying to sit on it.
When I tried to stop her
she challenged me to ride
this horse and control it.
Ask her once..
Ask her if she challenged me or not.
Yes, I..
I had challenged him
but I did not ask him
to leave with the horse.
Are you not afraid of me?
Are you not afraid of death?
When I am telling the truth
I do not fear anyone.
I fear neither death nor you.
You should not have
lied or challenged this boy.
Sister, you do not know
but someone is going to bear
the consequences
of your manipulations.
I am explaining this
to you for the second time.
The people, things or places
that belong to me
cannot be touched by anyone else!
'I like you a lot.'
'I wish to keep you with me.'
'Both of us will be close friends.'
Tell me. What do I have to do today?
I do not have any work for you today.
Take some rest.
Complete your sleep.
This is your task for the day.
You are playing with me, are you not?
It is because I am
not as intelligent as you.
I am a 16-year-old, ordinary boy
and I am your slave.
That is the reason, is it not?
If you are a real player
why do you not play
with Dhananand's life?
He snatched an old woman's
son from her in front of me.
He buried a man alive
who came to him asking for justice.
You should go against that king!
The king
who decapitated
his beloved horse in an instant
because a slave had touched it.
Now, do not say
that you did not have any help.
Or that I, your spy
am not doing my work properly.
You want to dethrone King Dhananand
on the basis of information and news!
Then listen.
A big celebration is
about to happen in the palace
that will be attended
by a special guest.
This guest is not a friend
but a foe.
He is a foreign enemy.
'A foreign enemy.'
'It means Seleucus Nicator.'
'What is that evil
Dhananand planning?'
Here you go.
Your spy has given
you the information.
Can you do anything about this?
You might have established
many goals in your life.
But the question is..
How many goals did
you fail to achieve?
On failing
you must think
that you worked hard
and did not let your resolve break
then why you still failed.
To know the answer to this question
ask a question to yourself.
Who all knew about the plan
that you had considered your goal?
When a papaya tree fruits
it is covered with a cloth.
It is done
to prevent birds and
insects to be attracted
towards it due to its
colouration and smell.
So, if you want to enjoy the fruit
you will have to hide it.
Only being a hard worker
is not sufficient to succeed.
If you want to achieve your goal
you will have to keep your plan
to achieve the goal a secret.
A secretive plan
ensures victory.
It is my ethics
and your destiny.
You will have to make an impossible
task possible, Chandragupta.
This is the most challenging
chapter of your life.

================================================================================

Episode: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZpTu0PXzDiE

They are making arrangements
for a big festival in the palace
which will be attended
by a special guest.
But he is not an enemy but a foe.
He is a foreigner.
I have leaked the secret
information to you.
I will take your leave now.
Foreigner.
Seleucus Nicator.
What new plan has wicked
Dhananand has come up with?
Shatkar.
Acharya Chanakya.
Close the door.
Shatkar,
what is the most precious thing
at Dhananand's place when
you served as his minister?
He has many valuables.
No, Shatkar. Tell me something
that was the most precious.
The thing that caught
everybody's attention.
Which is very clear to notice.
The diamond studded throne
of Dhananand's throne.
Great.
Really great.
What is the matter, Chanakya?
Seleucus will soon arrive
here to meet Dhananand.
He has not left any stone
unturned to welcome him.
Oh, God!
With time, Seleucus' desire
to invade the nation is increasing.
Even Dhananand is not trying
to stop him owing to his greed.
If his doubts regarding
Seleucus' intentions gets removed
it will bring a calamity for us.
If he comes to know that Seleucus is
not responsible for attacking Durdhara
he will start looking
for the real culprits.
This will bring you more troubles.
On the other hand, the bond between
Dhananand and Seleucus will strengthen.
I know that.
But I am not worried
about this trouble.
The growing friendship
between Dhananand and Seleucus
is what worries me.
Their unity will not only
prove disastrous for Magadh
but for the entire country.
What is your plan, Acharya?
I have to get the diamond
stolen from his throne.
I have to tweak the
circumstances in a way
that he will doubt Seleucus.
I will create a rift between them
that cannot be bridged.
No human can do it, Acharya.
Shatkar,
there is someone who can do it.
No physical rest can
help soothe an unstable mind.
You are the source of all my troubles.
I am calm now. Let me rest for now.
Prove me.
What proof do you need?
Prove that you have a calm mind.
What you can see is six earthen pots.
Five of them have
burning coal in them.
But one is devoid of it.
So what?
Can you remember which
one is devoid of it?
You are a stubborn guy.
I cannot explain anything
to you logically.
Yes, I remember
which pot is empty.
Let's find out.
Tell me which pot is empty.
Sure?
Hey, you have my answer!
Fine.
I hope you will not
have a problem lifting it.
What is going on?
Why did you burn my hand?
No, I did not.
You are the one who chose the pot.
You cannot blame me
for your wrong judgement.
You broke the pot for no reason.
This is fine.
Take a look there.
I have many pots.
Are you ready?
Yes.
Pay attention.
This is an empty one.
Tell me which pot is empty.
This one.
Are you sure?
No! This one.
Hold it.
Not again!
You did not concentrate yet again.
I asked you to concentrate.
Let us try again.
Make sure..
No! Wait..
Wait..
Let us do it.
Tell me which pot is empty.
This one.
We associate our
memory with our senses.
If you concentrate and
observe everything happening
around you minutely,
your memory will never let you down.
Acharya, I am tired of
listening to you speeches.
Let me rest now!
Goodnight.
Chandragupta, until I fulfil my dream
I will not let you sleep peacefully.
This was your first
stage of your training.
The second stage
will commence shortly.
I am impressed with you, Mura.
You decorated the path of my guest.
And you did all the
arrangements in such less time.
You worked so hard that
you have blisters on your hands.
Please forgive me.
Forgive me. Kindly forgive me.
My hand slipped, Mura.
I will fix this at once.
It does burn but I have heard
that even the greatest
of wounds can be healed by mead.
I wish to heal my wounds
of suspicion on Seleucus.
I think you must be
given the duty to serve
as personal attendant to
Seleucus and to serve him wine!
Certainly.
You have such a great
guest coming to you.
So the goblet must be exquisite.
The greatest of goblets
to serve the best of wine.
If you do not have any good goblets
then you must see the
ones you robbed from Piplivan.
You will find some.
My choice has always been the finest.
I am certain that your
honour will be exalted.
A lady from a warrior
clan is not ashamed
to serve wine to a foreigner guest?
Certainly not.
If I keep serving you
and your esteemed guests
then I might..
I might get the chance one day
to serve you some wine
and I lace it with poison.
And I will see you dying,
writhing in pain.
Mura!
Nursemaid.
Mura, you are done here.
Hey!
Nursemaid! Nursemaid!
Please stop! What are you doing?
Do not stop me!
This is what I deserve.
This is the command of your Lord.
Dhananand,
I have not given birth to you
but you are no less
to me than Bhadrasaal.
And I cannot see you,
my son, being insulted
and by a foul handmaiden! That Mura!
That Mura did not just humiliate you!
She was warning you!
Nursemaid!
You are taken aback
by words of a handmaiden?
No!
I am hurt because of you.
Why did you stop
me from punishing her?
You love me more than your son
and yet you do not understand me?
I never forgive anyone.
I only wait.
To strike at the right time.
In inflict the greatest pain.
I am quiet
since I wait for the right moment.
I do not understand.
Try to understand.
What could it be that
has made Mura so bold again?
What can it be that
strengthened the broken Mura?
I had killed all her family!
I killed her husband
and I killed her
son in front of her eyes
and I shattered all her hope and yet..
How does she grow so fierce?
Who has rekindled hope within her?
I wish to know that.
I can kill Mura in an instant.
But I have stopped myself
since I wish to know the
one who is behind this game.
One that is playing against
me by siding with Mura.
That person will play a move
when Seleucus arrives.
And hence I chosen Mura
to attend to Seleucus in person.
So that I can see the threat
from her eyes.
What is this?
Enough rest. Time to work.
What is it now?
You have to go to
Dhananand's court hall.
There is his throne,
sculpted in a great lion's form.
There is a priceless
diamond studded in the throne.
You have to steal it.
You made me your spy
and I did accept that.
And I did tell you
that the Emperor is preparing
to welcome an enemy of his!
And then you made me play
that silly game with pots!
And I did play it
but now you take my sleep away
and you push me to jaws of death!
Stealing? From the Emperor's palace?
From his throne room?
From his very throne?
It will be better for
me to do something else.
I will tell the Emperor about you.
And I can tell him
where you are hiding.
Chandragupta, I have told you
that you may go to Dhananand and tell
him about me in a manner, you please.
My hiding place or
any other thing else.
But in such a case
I will have to inform
Dhananand of your truth.
To tell him who you are.
I have to tell him why
you chose to work in the palace.
So you can search for
your mother as you please.
And you know well
that after he knows this,
what he will do next.
Nothing worse than what
you are doing to me, Acharya!
You make me so furious
that I fail to grasp
what is more tenacious,
the will of mine to be free of you
or to find my mother!
On guard, Chandragupta.
Have care how you speak.
I am the only person in this world
who can unite you with your mother.
What? What did you say?
That I can help you meet your mother.
You are lying. This is treachery.
Chandragupta!
You may think of me whatever you want
but you know this
well that I do not lie.
Nor do I trick people.
I can do what I have said
but
you must finish this task I give you.
If you hold a gem with you
it adds to your identity
and if the next person has it
it's light blinds you.
If you have it
you can add it to your
crown and exalt your prosperity.
And if it is with your enemy
then it can trouble you direly!
The wise folk are like diamonds.
If you have them with
you then they are a great tool
and if they stand by the enemy
then they are a terrible weapon.
So you must rally the
best to your side at once
and never let them go.
My lessons and your actions.
The security of the
palace is very strict.
When you cannot find a straight path
you must find a different one,
Chandragupta.
If there is no way
left for you to enter
you will have to enter secretly.

================================================================================

Episode: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2d6Chx8wv0

What happened, Chandra?
This fraud sage..
He is asking me to steal
Emperor Dhananand's diamond.
And do you know what
he will give me in exchange?
Information about my mother.
I see that you are astound.
Instead of working
for this fraudulent sage
I would prefer being
the slave of Lubdhak.
At least he does not try
to prove that he is the best.
While look at him!
He has seen a dream for
the better future of his nation.
His principles and
values were all a lie
and deception.
Come on, let us go. Pack your things.
We are not bound to work
for this fraudulent and cheat
who only cares about
his selfish needs.
But, Chandra,
since he is asking you to do it
I am certain there must
be an important reason.
Besides, you go there every day,
do you not?
Yes, but as a guard.
Besides..
The security of the
palace is very strict.
Every day, when I reach the palace
I must inform the head
of security of my arrival
and he writes down my name.
And then I am given a bracelet
after which I can enter.
There are bracelets
of different colours
to go to different
parts of the palace.
And in the evening,
we are supposed to return
the bracelets which reaches
the head of security.
There is never a
mistake in this process.
So there is no way
I can enter at night.
When you cannot find a straight path
you must find a different one,
Chandragupta.
If there is no way
left for you to enter
you will have to enter secretly.
We speak of Emperor
Dhananand's throne.
The King of Magadha, Dhananand!
He is the lord of this world.
He is the God of Magadha.
Do you know?
Even the air around
us follows his commands.
And you ask me to steal his diamonds?
He kills thousands when
a piece of gold goes missing.
Imagine what he will
do to me for that diamond.
This path of yours
will lead to my death and..
This is a map.
This is the different path
that will lead you
straight to the throne.
Very few people know of this map.
I would not deny that
this path is difficult
but if you memorise
this map and then start
you will not only steal the diamond
but also walk out
of the palace, alive.
Memorise this.
- Did you memorise it?
- Yes.
You may consider that your
life depends on your memory.
Hey.. What are you doing?
- How will I find my way now?
- You are a spy, Chandragupta.
And a spy does not leave any trails.
Had you carried this map,
it would put your life at risk.
Have you lost your mind?
Why did you make it
if you had to burn it?
Oh!
It was my fault.
How could I imagine
that you would think
of an easy task for me?
You enjoy making things difficult.
But keep this thing in mind, Acharya.
I am very emotional about my mother.
After doing this task
if you do not tell me about my mother
I will create so many problems for you
that you lose your mind solving them.
Acharya, you want
Chandragupta to be an emperor.
But emperors punish thieves
while you made him one.
Such a strange riddle.
What you call theft is a task.
A part of his training.
A lot of things depend
on the success of this task
especially securing
the dream of a united India.
This might be the greatest
challenge of my life
but I will complete this
to get to you, Mother.
Look, Princess.
The King has gifted this
to you just to please you.
He killed Toofan in front of you.
And so this beautiful
chandelier is a compensation.
You are not angry anymore, right?
I am, Shipra.
I am angry.
He should have punished
the slave who rode Toofan
rather brother killed Toofan.
He sacrificed his loyal horse
and not that slave.
I feel so enraged when I
see brother's admiration for him.
What do you think?
You are my best friend.
What is your opinion?
Should he have done that?
According to me,
the King made a wise choice.
And it was not his fault in it.
You must not forget your true place
after a little appreciation, Shipra.
Sentries!
I call you my friend
but the truth is that
you are a handmaiden.
And you are not supposed
to oppose your lords.
Will you remember that?
Everyone is loving this slave.
I must put him down
in the eyes of my brother.
Anyway..
I will not have to try very hard.
His foolishness will
give me a chance to do that.
Chandragupta?
What is he doing in
the palace at this hour?
If it was Chandragupta
then it is the opportunity
I was waiting for.
Get ready to be punished by the king,
Chandragupta.
Where did he go?
Someone was definitely here.
But where did that person go?
I was fortunate enough
to escape her notice.
I have to think something.
If I get caught today then
King Dhananand will decapitate me.
I have to find a solution.
Did the Brahmin go insane
that he burnt that map?
The map!
'Our memory is related to our senses.'
'If you concentrate and analyse
the things that are happening'
'in front of you'
'your memory will not fail you.'
I found the way.
What are you both doing
here at this hour of the night?
Princess,
I heard a noise in this area.
That was made by my cat.
Go from here. You are disturbing me.
Of course.
'If it is you, Chandragupta'
'then believe me..'
'I will bring your truth
in front of the king.'
'Mother!'
'Mother!'
'I am the only man in this world'
'who can possibly unite
you with your mother.'
'I will have to find that diamond'
'to reach my mother.'
'This place appears to be hollow.'
'According to the map, I can
enter the royal court from here.'
'I cannot see a way'
'by which I can fool these
guards and reach the throne'
'to steal that diamond.'
'I found a way!'
Hey! How did the torches extinguish?
Light them up again!
Before the soldiers arrange
for the torches to be lit
I will steal the diamond.
The diamond that
is akin to stone to me
will become my instrument
to meet you, Mother.
You will soon be in front of me
to answer all my questions.
In life, you cannot always achieve your
goal with sweet behaviour and ease.
If you have to affix
something to a wall
you need a nail.
Only hard work and simple nature cannot
make you successful for a long time.
For that, you need to bring tenacity,
strictness
and sharpness in your decisions.
Just like this nail.
It is flat at the top end
and sharp at the bottom end.
While advising someone
be simple.
But while putting that into
action be sharp and tenacious!
It is my ethics and your destiny.

================================================================================

Episode: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lW1sVi6wjE

The diamond which carries
no value in my eyes
will become a medium
for me to meet you, Mother.
You will be before me shortly
to answer all my questions.
Chandragupta, there are
all the signs of you being here
yet, I do not see you.
Why am I unable to find you?
Ma'am?
Ma'am, thank you for
saving me from that princess.
But what are you
doing here at this hour?
You are the princess's bodyguard
during the day time, right?
Yes, ma'am.
But, after all, I am a servant.
And it is the duty of a servant
to fulfill the command of his master.
And my new master
is a bit strange.
He makes me do the things
that I do not want to.
Actually, it is not
him but my biological mother
who compels me to do all this.
Because I am longing
so much to meet her
that I am ready to
do anything for that.
So that I can meet
her and let her know
how much I hate her.
F-Forgive me, ma'am..
I should not have
said this before you.
I am sure that it is our bond
which makes you pour
your heart to me.
Bond?
What bond are you
talking about, ma'am?
The bond..
..that is..
The bond that servants
share with each other.
Yes, you are right.
You should go now.
Not from there. Go from this way.
Listen!
Be safe.
'Why did Chandragupta
enter the palace at this hour?'
Good! Very good!
I knew that only you could
fulfill this impossible task.
That is why I say that one day
you will be the emperor
of the united Bharat.
We had a deal
that you will give information about
my mother in return of this diamond.
If you want this diamond
you will have to tell
me who my mother is.
Of course, Chandragupt.
Even I am impatient to
help you meet your mother.
What?
Does that mean you will
not give me her information
but actually help me meet her?
Yes, Chandragupta.
It is time for you
to meet your mother.
Come.
'Chandra..'
'I have made all of them for you.
Have patience.'
'Here, take this. Enjoy.'
After many years
I will be feeding you this sweet,
Chandragupta.
I will wash away your hatred
with my motherly love.
How far is my mother?
Where have you called her?
What happened, Acharya?
Why did you stop?
Where are you taking me?
I am taking you to your mother.
It is very important
for you to meet her.
Your Highness, the soldiers
are very tired and so are the horses.
Shall we let them take some rest?
We cannot invade
countries by taking rest.
The one who stops to take
rest will never achieve his aim.
I want to invade this
country as early as possible.
And this time, I will take the advantage
of my friendship with Magadha
and take my first
step towards the goal
that I am chasing.
I, Seleucus, the new emperor of this
country will build my palace here.
These Indians are very wealthy.
My life's goal is to acquire it.
I will only rest after
reaching Dhananand's palace.
Where is my mother, Acharya?
Look carefully.
You mother is present everywhere
over here, Chandragupta.
Look at the sky,
change your perspective.
Your mother is everywhere.
That mountain.
That mountain is her head.
The river that flows
long distances is her body.
The huge sky..
That is her dress.
Chandragupta.
The lady who gives birth
to us is not our only mother.
Our country is our mother too.
We breathe her air.
That air flows in our veins.
This is your real mother,
Chandragupta.
Your motherland.
Experience the breeze
flowing through leaves.
Hear the sound.
It would sound like a lullaby.
This earth will take care of you.
This is your mother, Chandragupta.
This is your real mother.
Where are you going?
To my room.
What are you hiding in your hands?
Nothing.
Nothing?
Let me see what is in your hands.
You are a servant who eats Rotis.
Whom were you taking the Laddus for?
Is this for the servant, Chandragupta?
I am sure that it is for him.
Where is he?
Chandragupta?
Why would he be here?
He guards during the day, right?
Why would he be here at night?
But yes, those Laddus were for him.
So what? So what?
How are you related to that servant?
Why do you love him so much?
You need to have a heart
to understand relationships.
You all stone-hearted.
You cannot understand.
You can snatch a son from his mother.
But her motherhood..
You all cannot take
away her motherhood.
You and that servant
cannot fool me, Mura.
I know.
You have seen him enter this palace.
Though, you would not tell me about it
I will find out about this.
Why did he come here at this hour
by avoiding such tight security?
Are you fooling me?
No. I am waking you up.
I am showing you the truth.
For the past few days,
you saw it, yourself.
You experienced that King Dhananand
- is such a heartless..
- Enough!
I'd told you that I need information
about my mother not your knowledge.
I'd also told you not to joke
around with me regarding my mother.
I am neither interested
in your dreams nor your truth.
I do not care about becoming the king!
Did you not hear me?
I just want to meet my mother.
Just like how you are getting
emotional about your mother
if you get emotional about
your motherland's protection
the country will change.
Believe me.
The day you realise the truth
you will be above your
hatred for your mother.
Our first duty is
to protect our motherland
from difficulties and evil
intentions of other countries.
When our motherland is in trouble
we cannot just think of our mother.
There are many things
other than self-interest.
Well, thank you
for making me realise
that we should never depend on anyone.
Henceforth, I will trust only myself.
Do you think I will not
be able to find my mother
without your help?
You are wrong, Acharya.
Now I will show you who I am.
I will find my mother by myself.
- You are getting emotional again,
Chandragupta. - Yes, I'm!
And why should I get
emotional every time?
Now wait and watch
as to how I play with your emotions.
You played this game with me
for this diamond, right?
But I do not think you deserve this.
I will now find my mother by myself.
I hope we never meet.
Goodbye!
This is why you are unique,
Chandragupta.
This passion,
self-confidence and depth in thoughts
are very rare qualities!
Hence, I am sure that it
is you who will fulfill my dream
of a united Bharat.
That is why I brought you here.
I knew that out of anger,
you would do something
as unexpected as
throwing this diamond.
And that is exactly what you did.
The foundation of the united Bharat
should be laid by its future emperor.
I am sure
that this diamond has
reached its right place.
I have never seen such
a rare diamond in my life.
Look at its glitter!
This country is actually very wealthy.
Come, let us show
this to King Seleucus.
Yes, come.
Everything is going
as per Acharya's plan.
Are you not the one who
said that we should wait?
But look at the wealth
scattered in this country.
I want to gather all of it,
as soon as possible.
Imagine how wealthy
this country would be
if we find such rare
and valuable diamonds
lying on the ground.
The diamond has reached
its right place.
I hope Seleucus likes this gift.
He will surely show
it to Dhananand tomorrow.
And then, it will be the start
of my politics of divide and rule.
What will you do if you find a snake?
You will either maintain
distance from it
or kill it.
You will never keep it with you.
That is the case with
evil people as well.
An evil person will create
only troubles for you.
He will either scare
you or finish you.
Both these consequences are not good.
After finding out about an evil person
there is only one
way to deal with him.
Finish him.
If you ever have to trust
between an evil man and a snake
always choose the snake.
Because a snake bites
only when its life is in danger.
But an evil person
will always try to harm you
for his interest.
My policies, your future.
This diamond is a priceless
gem that was embedded
in the throne of Emperor Dhananand.
You must give it back at once.
Indeed.
And soon all your precious gems
will be offered at my feet.

================================================================================

Episode: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0y2970t5rsQ

Chandra, hurry up!
We do not know when
Lubdhak might wake up!
All right! I know it!
There has to be something around here
that will help me get
any clue about my mother.
Go! Search for it!
Check every corner
before Lubdhak wakes up.
We have to find it.
But it is possible that
Acharya Chanakya has a reason
why he is keeping you
away from your mother!
Listen to me.
You all must tell me, today.
Do you stand with
me or with that priest?
I will no longer help
him in this lifetime.
Chandra! He is waking up!
- Let us go. Move from here.
- Let's go.
No!
No one is moving from
here till I find the chest.
Chandra, we have checked everywhere.
It is not here.
There has to be something here.
If it is not evident,
it must be hidden.
Something that leads me to my mother..
'There is something over here.'
Piplivan?
'Piplivan' inscribed over here.
Why does Lubdhak have
the robes of Piplivan?
You have got the clue, Chandra.
But who will be able
to shed light on this matter?
'I am not an attendant
in service of Dhananand.'
'I am from the warrior clan.
The queen of Piplivan.'
There is someone inside the palace
who can help me with this.
Chandra, have you lost your mind?
Do not even think of
going to the palace anymore!
You have stolen the diamond
from the throne of the Emperor!
Going back to the palace
could be dangerous, Chandra!
If this threat can lead
me to a clue about my mother
I will walk past death,
let alone going back in the palace!
You are all well aware
how much the Emperor
loves his belongings!
And just the thought
of someone stealing
something valuable to him,
infuriates the Emperor!
And such an event has come to pass!
His precious diamond from
the throne has been stolen.
If anyone from you knows about it
then come forth and have
no fear as you tell us the truth.
But remember this well..
The Emperor hates half a truth
and a vile lie!
So this is no time for
hearsay and imaginations.
So if you are certain
then you may come forth and speak
or else the thief and
the one who distracts us
will meet the same fate!
They will be killed!
If none of you know
anything about this
then the Emperor will punish
anyone if he suspects anyone.
Commander Bhadrasaal.
Summon the garrison unit
that was placed here at night
and take them to the Emperor.
And you all..
You all..
You are all suspects till
we get the diamond and the thief.
The day we find the thief
I will kill him right then and there!
'And this new master
of mine is strange!'
'He makes me do things
that I do not want to!'
'Can it be that Chandragupta
has stolen the diamond?'
'I hope that Veerbhadra's mother
has all the answers that I seek.'
Is everything all right?
You are late.
Yes.. I..
I woke up a little late.
'It seems that everyone
knows about the diamond.'
'What is going on here?'
So tell me.
How did it happen?
How was the diamond taken
while you all were present?
What could be the reason behind this?
Was it money? Was it greed?
Was it something else?
Are the wages,
that I pay you, falling short?
Speak up!
You are all quiet.
Your silence tells me
that you have no answer for me.
Then so be it.
I offer you two choices.
You have to chew these
shards of glass with bread
and if you cannot take
the pain you may use this dagger.
You may choose as you see fit.
Bhadrasaal.
They are all good apples.
A rotten one must be the one
we seek and we are yet to find it.
You..
- Listen to me, Chandra.
- It is good that I found you.
I was looking for you.
Chandra, it is a grave matter.
Chandra, tell me the truth.
Did you steal the diamond
from the Emperor's throne?
Is that why you came
to the palace last night?
Tell me the truth.
Lady, you have been asking
me questions all this long.
And now it is time for
you to answer my questions
and only then I will
tell you the truth.
Do you know about this waistcloth?
Look carefully.
It was with my old master Lubdhak.
He had kept it hidden.
It has 'Piplivan' inscribed over it.
And you were the Queen of Piplivan.
'This is the royal emblem that
I gave Chandra when he was an infant!'
Lady. Can you tell me
how did it reach that Lubdhak?
Lady.
Only your answer can
take me to my mother.
What are you thinking?
You do know something about this.
I..
Where is the guard Chandragupta?
He was right here!
'What bond do you
share with that slave?'
'Why such care for him?'
You must go from here.
If they find you here..
- You must go now.
- No, Lady.
I need my answers.
You do know about this waistcloth.
Something that you are hiding from me.
Chandra, you must leave now.
If they see you with me, they will..
No, you must leave at once!
Leave from here!
You there! Guard!
Who are you looking for?
Here he is!
Yes.
I was right here.
Come with us,
the Emperor has summoned you.
Is that so?
Let us go.
Dear God!
Does Dhananand think that
Chandragupta is the thief?
Where is that diamond?
Dear God!
It is the same diamond!
You are a great merchant
of Magadha who trades gems.
Tell me all about this.
This diamond is a priceless
gem that was embedded
in the throne of Emperor Dhananand.
When the Emperor defeated
the Kingdom of Piplivan
he found this diamond
as he raided their treasury.
I was the one who carved
it and placed it in the throne.
It is very dear to the Emperor.
He must be restless after
seeing that it is stolen.
Many must have been beheaded by now.
You must give it back at once.
Indeed.
What is it, my Lord?
Please forgive me if I have
said anything to offend you.
I forgive you.
Tell me.
Is it as strong as it is bright?
Yes, my Lord.
Diamond is the strongest in the world.
The more it shines the stronger it is.
It can cut metal.
Thank you.
That is all what I wanted to know.
Now you know the
power of this diamond.
Now it is your Emperor
who will suffer.
And soon he will see
that Seleucus is even more
stronger than this diamond!
And soon all your precious gems
will be offered at my feet.
And the ones who defy me
will die by my hand as you died!
All the authorities present
here had always warned me
that I was trusting you blindly
but I paid no heed to them.
I kept trusting you.
And someone close to me
and trusted by me has
cheated me and betrayed me!
A priceless diamond studded
in my throne has been stolen
right from within my palace walls!
Do you have anything
to say about this, slave?
If you go to someplace as a guest,
you like it.
You are respected,
honoured and greeted well.
And then gradually you begin comparing
it with your own house as it is
and you see your own house as lowly.
A country that has
no respect or wisdom..
A country that does not
have many opportunities for life
is abandoned by many.
But if your own house
is not pretty to look at
you do not abandon it.
You decorate the house,
you enhance its beauty.
If your nation does
not bring you respect
and does not have many
means for a livelihood
then you are to be blamed as well.
And in this case, you must
not think of your nation as weak
as compared to distant lands.
Spread wisdom around.
Bring in more means for
people to earn their keep.
Respect everyone and be respected.
Since no matter how pretty
someone else's house may seem
you can only sleep
well on your own bed.
A lesson from me
and an action from you.
Acharya, you didn't want
Chandragupta to get any news
But he has found a waist
cloth in Lubdhak's house.
Yes, Acharya.
And to find out more about that
Chandragupta has
gone back to the palace.
Perhaps he might find
out about his mother.

================================================================================

Episode: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lieLa5i6DvY

A very precious diamond inlaid into
my throne was stolen from my palace.
Do you have anything
to say about that, slave?
No, I do not know
anything regarding the diamond.
Acharya, what if the king finds
out that Chandragupta is the thief
who stole his precious diamond?
There are some villages
on the boarder here
and it is important
to sway them in our favour.
What I meant to say
is that there has been
such a big incident in the palace.
It should have caused shock waves
throughout the whole Pataliputra.
But everything is very normal.
That means Dhananand
has got the thief.
Everything is normal
because Dhananand wants
everything to be normal.
I do not understand, Acharya.
Dhananand will definitely find out
who the betrayer
is who stole the diamond
but not today.
Today, everyone will stay quiet
in this regard.
This news about theft
must not leave the palace.
Because today
I will welcome a very special guest
Seleucus, the king of Yavana.
If a guest sees his host's worry
he either takes it as an insult
or an opportunity
to take advantage of.
And I do not want to give Seleucus
either one.
Poor Dhananand.
He has thrown away
money in our welcome
in an attempt to hide
the news of the theft.
Such a big price to hide one weakness.
King Seleucus is
welcome to Pataliputra.
Looks like King Dhananand
is not very happy about my arrival.
That is why he has sent
a seneschal to welcome me
instead of coming himself.
The king of Magadha
is at the right place
considering his majesty and
honour on the throne of Magadha.
Allow me to greet you.
I will take you to our King Dhananand.
Where is Veerbhadra's mother?
I am sure she definitely
knows something about my mother.
Where did she go?
You?
Here?
Why are you not at your place?
The whole palace is standing in
welcome to the king's special guest.
What are you doing here?
I do not have to answer you.
I am aware what my duty is.
Princess, are you absolutely sure
the one whom you saw
last night was Chandragupta?
There, think of the
devil and the devil is here.
Seems like you did not get
a good sleep last night, Chandragupta.
No, I slept peacefully, Princess.
Thank you for worrying about me.
You are very lucky that
you could get good sleep.
I was looking for
a thief the whole night
who had come towards
this part of the palace.
Yes. Do you know
that intruder kept wandering
through the palace the whole night?
And Prince Durdhara
looked for him herself.
But she could only find some dirt.
Seems like the thief was very clever.
How can you be so calm
in such a critical situation,
Chandragupta?
The kingdom is facing such a danger
so why is your demeanor so calm?
Look here. Here is your thief.
Nowadays he likes strolling
through different parts of the palace.
And the dirt you were talking about..
Look.
It is the same dirt. Look closely.
So now if I have your permission
may I escort you to the court
where King Dhananand
and his very special guest
is waiting for you?
All hail Seleucus,
the King of Yavana..
All hail Seleucus,
the King of Yavana..
All hail Seleucus,
the King of Yavana..
All hail Seleucus,
the King of Yavana..
All hail Seleucus,
the King of Yavana..
Welcome, friend.
You are welcome to Magadha once more.
Please be seated.
Please wait.
Your place is not here.
It is over there.
I am sure you will not take offense,
Seleucus.
Only one person has the
right to sit beside me in Magadha
my lovely sister, Durdhara.
Why would I take offense, King?
Princess Durdhara has reminded
me of my daughter, Helena.
Greetings, Princess.
But why would Dhananand
not reveal to Seleucus
that his diamond was stolen?
They are playing a game
of political diplomacy.
If Seleucus comes to know
that a diamond was stolen
from right under the nose
of the powerful king of Magadh
he will get the idea
that King Dhananand is weak
and the king would never want this.
But, Acharya, isn't it Seleucus
who is set to gain from this?
He will take this diamond
with him very easily.
No! He will definitely
return this diamond to Dhananand.
What!
Acharya, I don't understand!
You ensured that Seleucus
found that diamond
so that it creates a rift
between Dhananand and Seleucus.
Now if Seleucus hands
the diamond over to Dhananand
how will it cause
problems between them?
How will it make them part ways?
They will definitely part ways.
That is because both of
them have the same weakness.
It is their greed.
Their effort in this political game
is to overwhelm
and subdue each other.
Under such circumstances,
Dhananand's treasured diamond
gets stolen
and Seleucus returns
that stolen diamond back to him.
By this he will not
only make Dhananand curious
but also give him the idea
that Seleucus is kind and powerful.
It will also send a message
that Seleucus doesn't
value the diamond
that Dhananand loves the most
and that is why he'll give it back.
By doing this he'll get
a chance to humiliate Dhananand
and brag about it
and this will be his first
move to subdue the king of Magadh.
That is why this diamond will surely
give rise to hatred between them.
In reality this diamond
is more precious to us than
it is to Dhananand and Seleucus.
This diamond is turning
out to be crucial
towards fulfilling our
dream of a united nation.
- Ma'am..
- Dhananand doesn't care
about the emotions of
a mother who is mourning.
He just cares about flaunting
the huge number of slaves
while welcoming his foreign guests.
But, ma'am,
you don't need to do all this.
- You are a queen, aren't you?
- I was a queen.
But there's only one king here.
And he is seated on the throne.
All of us are his slaves.
I know, you want to ask
me a lot of questions but
this is not the right
time or place for that.
Wonderful..
She looks beautiful.
Before I get blown
away by Magadh's beauty
I should come to the point.
I have come here to strengthen
the friendship between us.
That's why I wish
to deploy a small military
camp in your country
so that we can help
you when you need it
and save you from your enemies.
You want to protect me
and protect the kingdom of Magadh.
Wait a minute.
Vaibhav Singh?
Seleucus has put his hand
forward as a sign of friendship
so on behalf of the king
will give your hand to Seleucus?
Yes, my King.
What is this? And why?
It's because I said so.
He did that because I wanted
to set a clear example before you
about how loyal and faithful
my subjects and soldiers actually are.
My subject chopped his hand off
and gave it to you at my order.
Just think
will these people think twice
before sacrificing their
lives when my security is concerned!
No! And
what about your subjects?
Will your subjects do
all this for you, Seleucus?
Your silence is your answer, Seleucus.
That is why, my dear friend, Seleucus
I don't need your army's help
and neither does Magadh
need your military camp.
Wow! What a way to explain your point!
Now it is my turn.
I want to give a gift
to the King of Magadh.
'You tricked me just to
get your hands on this diamond.'
'But I don't think you deserve this!'
'So this is the plan'
'that you were hatching,
Acharya Chanakya.'
There's a huge problem, Acharya..
Acharya, you didn't want
Chandragupta to get any news
about his mother, didn't you?
But he has found a waist
cloth in Lubdhak's house.
And 'Piplivan' is embroidered
on that waist cloth.
There was a royal
seal of Piplivan too.
Yes, Acharya.
And to find out more about that
Chandragupta has
gone back to the palace.
Perhaps he might find
out about his mother.
You are smiling.
The matter is such, Bhairav.
Because everything
is going according to plan.
I knew it very well
that Chandragupt wouldn't stop
until he found out about his mother.
That day is not far
when Chandragupta will
stand up against Dhananand
to fight for his rights
and the rights of all the people.
He will fight for his throne..
He will fight for a united nation..
A spear is used to bring
an elephant under control.
And a leash is used
to control a horse.
But if a leash is
used to ride an elephant
the rider may fall.
And if a horse is attacked
with a spear to control it
the horse may get injured.
Just like the way there
is a different ritual
to please different gods
there is also need to use different
weapons to control different animals.
Different people should be dealt with
acording to their behaviour and needs.
Some understand when explained
some join hands out of greed
some return to the right
track after being punished
and some need to be shattered
to make them submit.
Remember,
Lord Narayan's praises are not sung
in Lord Shiva's temple.
The rituals depend on
the God you are praying to.
The principles are mine
but the destiny will be yours.
I saw Chandragupta
in the palace that night.
I met Mura after that.
Hence I will blame Mura for all this.
Mura has been held captive.
She has been accused of
stealing the king's diamond.

I want to give a gift
to the King of Magadh.
Amazing!
This diamond is amazing!
It's very valuable too.
Because it's related to you.
I know that you actually
called me here to know
if I was the one who got your
adorable sister, Durdhara, attacked.
Just to show how
special she is for you
you have made her sit next to you.
This is the motive of my visit.
The ones whom you trust so much
cannot safeguard any
of your valuable things.
Be it your sister
or this rare diamond.
If someone can steal
this diamond from your throne
in your presence
even your sister is
not safe outside the palace
in your absence.
Trust me.
If I had any interest in your sister
she wouldn't have been
sitting next to you today.
Seleucus!
I am not your enemy, but a friend.
I want to safeguard you.
And as a mark of this friendship
I present you the diamond
which originally belongs to you.
I am sure that you will be nice to us
and let us set up our
military camp on your soil.
So that we can safeguard you.
Thank you so much
for this diamond, Seleucus.
You had a long journey.
I am sure you need to take some rest.
We shall talk about
the military strategy later.
Sure, my friend.
Dismiss!
'I see.'
'So this was what you were vying for,
Acharya Chanakya.'
The trees which stand
tall in the forest
are the ones which are cut down first.
Nobody cuts the trees
which are curved or bent.
This is our learning from this.
At times, being dubious
for a bigger cause is allowed.
At times, acting as per
the circumstances is allowed.
Because the right path
need not always be right.
Good.
Very good, Acharya.
This lesson suits you the most.
Making me steal the
king's valuable diamond
was that crooked path, right?
Chandragupta,
such things should not be said loudly.
And what you did was fair?
Do you even realise
the amount of difference
which you have created
between the two kingdoms?
Do you even know how
controversial this has become?
You do not know, right?
But you do not care,
as that was your motive.
Do you even know this?
Because of that one diamond
all those guards who were
deployed that night were killed.
You ruined the lives
of their families.
Collateral damage in a
war is unavoidable, Chandragupta.
Remember this.
This is a battle for a good cause.
Whoever supports the evil has to end.
Those guards chose
to support Dhananand.
That is why they died.
But you still have time.
Choose as to on which
side you will be.
Do you want to be
with that cruel Dhananand
or go against him?
Who are you to tell me that!
How can you decide what
is wrong and what is not?
You just care about satisfying
your interest by breaking the rules.
We were destined to
come together only this far.
Our paths can never be the same.
Chandra, listen..
I have got this healing paste made
by the royal vaid especially for you.
This will heal your wounds sooner.
No, thanks.
I do not need your help.
I know that you have some
information about that thievery.
You are even trying
to tell it to the king.
But something is stopping you.
Are you scared of the king's wrath?
Pandu, tell me.
What are you hiding?
I saw Chandragupta
that night in the palace.
And after that, I met Mura.
She seemed suspicious.
I do not know if they
are anyway connected.
But I have a strong feeling
that all this is surely
connected to the diamond thievery.
Pandu, you are great sword master.
You must believe in your gut feeling.
Yes. But that servant is now one among
the most trusted people of the king.
What do I do now?
Hence I will blame Mura for all this.
The king does not trust Mura.
This will surely make that
servant confess everything.
And I will also get rid of Mura.
He has given me the pain
that all the Kshatriyas
together have not given me.
Seleucus has humiliated me
in my council
in front of my subjects.
Nobody has ever humiliated me so much.
Did you see it, Amatya?
Did you see it?
Yes.
I saw everything, Your Majesty.
My..
My throne..
I do not want it.
I do not want it.
I do not want this diamond.
I do not want it.
I do not want anything.
Go away from my sight.
Whatever I have achieved so far
seems to be going in vain.
It feels like I have
become a barber again.
Just a barber.
I am feeling very small.
I am feeling insignificant.
You are making the Kshatriyas more
stronger by saying this, Your Majesty.
Lady, what connection does
this diamond have with the Kshatriyas?
Because that diamond has
been stolen by a 'Kshatrani'.
Mura has stolen it.
Your Majesty, just think about it.
Whose diamond was it?
Piplivan's.
Along with your humiliation
Mura has taken revenge
for her husband, her son
and her kingdom's defeat.
Mura!
Acharya,
how can you let him go so easily?
Chandra!
Anger disturbs a person's mind.
Something similar is happening
with Chandragupta right now.
Even if I try to
explain anything to him
he will not understand.
He will do what he wants.
Chandragupta.
Chandragupta,
Mura has been held captive.
She has been accused of
stealing the king's diamond.
Somebody save me.
Save me.
Scream. Shout.
Mura!
I gave you many chances
to remain alive.
I have overlooked all your mistakes.
But now..
Now, I have realised
that I will be never happy
as long as you remain in this palace.
You will keep troubling
me like a sorceress.
So, I am doing the same thing to you
that should be done to a sorceress.
A sorceress is burned alive.
Somebody save me.
Save me.
Scream more.
Shout more.
Nobody will come to help you, Mura.
Nobody will come.
'This was with my previous master,
Lubdhak.'
'Piplivan is also written on this.'
'Do you have any idea that
where could he have got it from?'
'Your answer alone can
help me find my mother.'
'Chandragupta,
I wish I could tell you..'
'I wish I could tell you
that I am your unlucky mother'
'whom you are looking for.'
"Chandragupta."
"Chandragupta."
Kill him.
Your Majesty, that slave is innocent.
Not she, but I have stolen
your precious diamond.
No!
This slave is lying.
Not he, but I have stolen the diamond.
Not at all, Your Majesty.
Look at her.
How can a woman who cannot
steal a grain of rice from your palace
have the courage
to steal your diamond?
She is a mad woman
who does not leave any
chance to humiliate you.
She has fooled your people.
I do not know why she tells everyone
that she has stolen the diamond.
I do not know what peace
she gets by saying this.
That is why I have saved
her from your punishment
because not she but I am the
one who has committed this crime.
Yes, Brother.
I had also seen him
in that area of the palace
the night the diamond was stolen.
Punish him immediately.
- No.
- Enough!
I totally agree with
my dearest sister.
I will have to kill you, Chandragupta.
Be it the war of
the kingdom or of life
the balance between
the sword and the armour
is very important.
The sword makes noise
when it leaves the sheath.
But the armour..
The armour remains quiet.
The sword moves forward
and attacks the enemy.
But the armour steps
back and protects us.
The sword sheds blood of
the enemy in the battlefield.
On the other hand,
in the same battlefield
the armour saves our
blood from being shed.
People who step into the
battlefield only with the sword
will either lose the
battle or their lives.
Do not have only smart and
intelligent people in your army.
Appoint some firm
and quiet people too.
When both of them are in your army
that is when you will win.
The teachings are mine.
The destiny is yours.

================================================================================

Episode: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QT97wR1JbAU

My Lord, it was not her but I who
stole that precious diamond of yours.
Now you will pay
for what you have done!
Bhadrasaal!
That is it!
You are playing just
as Seleucus wants you to.
Is that so?
You stole the diamond.
How does that relate to Seleucus?
Forgive me, my Lord.
Seleucus was the one who
told me to steal the diamond.
He had given me his word
that for stealing the diamond
he will be giving
me 10,000 gold coins.
But my Lord
I did not steal the
diamonds for the gold.
I had two objectives
behind stealing it.
First, to see where our guard lacks
and second, to show you
the true colours of Seleucus.
My Lord, he is a duplicitous man.
If it was not me
he would sway someone close
to you by luring them with gold.
That day, when I saved
Princess Durdhara from those men
one of them took me to Seleucus.
And I do not know why he knew
that I am close to royal family.
And using that to his advantage
he wanted to ensure his gain.
My Lord, he cannot be trusted.
Today, he has reached your diamond
and soon he can reach for your neck.
You must be on guard, my Lord.
So, why did you not inform
the Emperor or someone else?
Answer me!
Who would believe me?
My Lord, what I knew
was not a puny matter.
These words could
reach Seleucus himself.
I wanted to inform you once
Seleucus goes to his chambers.
And then all of this happened.
My Lord,
I never wanted to do any of it.
Slave, you are doomed to die.
I will decide where and when.
What..
What are you doing?
Do not forget that I am
a guest in your Kingdom!
Phillip! Nicanor!
It does sting when
someone shows your weakness
in front of the people
that you hold so close.
But you forced me to do so
Friend Seleucus.
This morning you told me
that my army is weak, incompetent
and you gave me my
own diamond as a gift.
So I was thinking of a way
to answer you.
What do you think of my answer?
Even your guard stands incompetent.
You could only reach
my diamond but I..
I have reached your neck.
So how can I allow you to
post a garrison unit in my kingdom?
Think over it.
You are safe since I am your friend.
But the enemy can strike your garrison
in the same manner as I did.
What do you want?
I want our alliance to be forged
without any angst.
And hence I have come here
to give you a chance.
A sole chance.
A
chance as a duel.
There will be a duel tomorrow between
one of my finest warriors and yours.
And if your champion wins
then you can post a garrison
here in the land of Magadha.
And if my champion wins
then you must accept
in front of all of Magadha
that Dhananand, Lord of
Magadha does not need any help!
You well know, Dhananand, that I have
the most fierce and strongest
warrior in the world.
Desmond.
Tales of his legendary combat
can be heard from Persia to Bharat.
He has never been defeated.
Who do you put forth?
I present him.
'If these two discuss anything about
the diamond, then I'll get exposed.'
This weak, frail youngling..
He will fight Desmond?
Then so be it.
As you wish.
I accept this challenge.
If you laugh so loud your
breath may clench your throat
and it might kill you.
We will meet tomorrow in the arena.
He will no longer be able
to see any dawn after tomorrow.
I believe it is time
for you to find another option
to fulfill your objective.
Bhairav, success cannot be replaced.
Nor can Chandragupta be.
Acharya, where are you going now?
A disciple may leave his
teacher while driven by rage
but a teacher never
abandons his disciple
especially when it is
about the life of the person
who will rule the united
land of Bharat in future.
I am heading towards the arena.
What?
No, Acharya!
Going there can be fatal.
The dawn of victory comes
after a night of perils.
'This weak, frail youngling..'
'He will fight Desmond?'
You are a fool!
Lady.
Why did you do so?
Why did you put your
life in peril just to save me?
Tell me!
I have a question before I answer you.
You were always aware
that I have stolen the diamond.
But why did you quietly
take the blame on yourself?
Why did you keep suffering?
And you did not utter
even a single word.
Why?
I think just like me,
even you do not know
why both of us are
doing this for each other.
Am I right, Lady?
According to me, we do not share
the relationship of slaves.
But it is more stronger
and deeper than this.
I can understand that you are the one
who can give me peace.
You are the one who can put
a rest to my search of several years.
You are the only one who
can tell me about my mother.
You know that she
belonged to Piplivan.
Do you know that?
I just know
that the battle which
you will be participating in
is a dangerous one.
And that is not just a battle
but the punishment
for stealing the diamond
which Dhananand wants to give you.
Chandra, take my advice.
Apologise to the king
and stop this battle. Okay?
I want your answer
and not your advice.
Answers related to
questions about my mother.
Will you be able to answer me?
Okay.
I will never ask you anything
about this matter henceforth.
Chandra!
If you have decided
to fight the war let me
bless you at least.
You will not give me what I want.
So, I will not accept
what you are giving me.
Go from here now
before somebody spots you with me.
Forgive me, Your Majesty.
But the warrior whom
you have chosen for the war
has left me surprised.
Your Majesty, I hope
that you do not become
a subject of humiliation
for years after this battle.
Amatya, take a look.
I will put this cockroach
into that vessel containing water.
But he is not trained, Your Majesty.
According to me,
Chandragupta is not a warrior.
And I am sure
that he does not even
know to hold the sword.
Tomorrow, the entire
world will have an eye on us.
On Pataliputra.
If Chandragupta loses the battle
Seleucus will not just
succeed in his intention
but Magadha will also
be humiliated for its defeat.
Minister
this cockroach is still moving.
This means, it is still alive
even though I put it into
a vessel containing water.
Try to understand, Your Majesty.
This is not the time to play games.
No.
No. No. No.
This is time to play games, Minister.
The game of life and death.
The game of victory of the strongest.
Look at this, Minister!
This cockroach is Chandragupta.
That is why I have chosen him.
He has come out of the
most difficult situations
in the recent times.
He has returned safe and victorious.
I have seen a strange fire within him.
He burns the most difficult situations
and he burns in the same fire
and comes out more stronger like gold.
Minister, I do not know why I feel
that he will definitely
cross this obstacle too
just like this cockroach.
What if he fails in doing so?
Let him die
with the thought
that he is invincible.
No, Your Majesty.
His death means
Seleucus' victory.
Minister, the Magadha king, Dhananand
is the only one who
will win in Magadha.
It will not make any difference
whether the outcome or situation
is in our favour or not.
No matter what the outcome
of tomorrow's battle will be
Seleucus will never succeed
in settling his army in Magadha.
Hope so!
Is anybody there?
What happened?
Look at this armour.
It is torn.
How will I fight the battle with this?
Give me some other armour.
Pandu arranges for armours.
And he told me that
he has only this armour
that fits your size.
Try wearing this.
It was lying unnecessarily
in the weapon room.
It may be of use to you.
Wow!
Thank you very much.
I do not know why
you look familiar to me.
You are absolutely right.
And you will see me
in the battlefield too.
Keep a watch on him.
Open haired Brahmin, you are here too.
Chandragupta, do not get angry
unnecessarily and waste your time.
You will not be able to hang
in there for long without my help.
It is better to die
instead of taking your help.
Remember this teaching of mine
if you are ready to die.
Intelligence always
overpowers strength.
Keep looking for me
constantly in the battlefield
and try to understand
my indications properly.
Only one leadership is great.
Look at your body.
Two eyes, two hands, 32 teeth
20 fingers and many organs.
But there is only one brain.
And all the parts of the body
function properly and carefully
on the leadership of this brain.
But if there is more than one brain
the body either acts
strange or falls sick.
So, just like the eyes,
nose, hands, ears and legs
keep many people who will advise you.
But if only person has the right
to become a leader and take decisions
the democracy remains strong
and you will attain success.
The teachings are mine
and destiny is yours.

================================================================================

Episode: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0l1ExnIbOqE

Listen to my advice carefully.
Intelligence always
overpowers strength.
Keep looking for me
continuously in the battlefield.
And try to understand
my indications properly.
You will not listen so easily.
Soldiers!
- What happened?
- This Brahmin..
What happened?
No, nothing. I had an illusion.
You may go.

Amatya Rakshas,
where is my special guest?
Neither is Seleucus here
nor that world famous warrior.
Alert!
In this battle organised in Magadha
the representative of Magadha
the brave, strong, and great warrior
Chandragupta is arriving.
"Chandragupta."
"Chandragupta."
- Hail Chandragupta.
- All hail!
- Hail Chandragupta.

- Hail Chandragupta.
- All hail!
- Hail Chandragupta.

He is the pride of his clan."
"He is cultured and intelligent,
he is as bright as the sun."

'Now that you have
decided to fight the war'
'let me bless you at least.'
'Forgive me, Veerbhadra's mother.'
'You were blessing me.'
'But I did not accept
your blessings in anger.'
'I need your same blessings today.'
I welcome,
Seleucus, the king of Greeks.
King Seleucus, I thought for a moment
that you and your strong
warrior will not arrive here today.
Where is that world famous Desmond?
Think about it once again.
I hope you do not make
any mistake in haste.
No, King Dhananand.
I have prayed to
the God of our battle.
I have offered a sacrifice.
Today's battle will be one-sided.
I will win, Your Majesty.
I think, your God has
not accepted your sacrifice.
That is why your
warrior is not visible.
You will hear him
before you can see him.
Splendid!
'O' great ancestors of Piplivan!'
'Please have your grace on us!'
'Please protect the
last son of your line!'
Chandragupta will die today
and I will have my revenge.
Hitting two marks with one strike.
Did you see that, Lord Dhananand?
He is the mightiest
soldier of my army.
The most fierce wrestler of mine!
It seems the duel will
end in a few moments.
Today
by the command of Lord of Magadha..
Here on the sacred land of Magadha
a duel has been
arranged in this arena.
We have Desmond,
the champion of Lord Seleucus.
Desmond! Desmond!
Desmond! Desmond! Desmond!
And representing Magadha,
we have Chandragupta!
Chandragupta! Chandragupta!
Chandragupta! Chandragupta!
There is no judge
for the duel apart from death.
The last man standing
shall win this duel.
The one who remains
alive will be the winner!
There is only one rule of this duel.
Victory!
My Lord,
do you still believe this slave?
Yes, Councillor.
This slave
will come out of there victorious.
Chandragupta.
Watch my instructions well.
We can only win if we fight together!
Desmond! Desmond!
Desmond! Desmond!
Desmond! Desmond!
Desmond! Desmond!
Desmond! Desmond! Desmond!
Chandra!
'Look at me, Chandragupta!'
Desmond! Desmond! Desmond!
Desmond! Desmond! Desmond!
Desmond! Desmond! Desmond!
Do you see, Shipra?
This arrogant slave
is paying for his sins.
He misbehaved with me.
This puny slave had this coming.
It seems you are concerned
for the slave, Shipra?
No, My Princess. You are right.
This slave deserves it.
He does.
Desmond! Desmond! Desmond!
Desmond! Desmond! Desmond!
Desmond! Desmond! Desmond!
Desmond! Desmond! Desmond!
Desmond! Desmond! Desmond!
Desmond! Desmond! Desmond!
Desmond! Desmond! Desmond!
Chandragupta, get up.
You must get up like a brave warrior
and end this duel with your victory.
Get up.
Chandragupta, look at me.
Look at me.
Recall what I told you.
'Intelligence is a favoured
trait over physical strength.'
"Chandragupta Maurya."
"Chandragupta Maurya."
"Chandragupta!"
"Chandragupta!"
"He is a striking force on the enemy!"
"Chandragupta!"
"His sight is as sharp as a blade."

Have you ever wondered
why a diamond is placed in a crown?
Why do we wear it as jewellery?
Why do we not throw it on the road?
After all, it is a stone, is it not?
Do we value it only
because it is beautiful?
Even the leaves are beautiful.
Then why do we find
them lying on the road?
Why do we crush them beneath our feet?
It is because of diamond's hardness.
Even if we even try to
crush the diamond under our feet
it will hurt us so bad
that we will never forget the wound.
That is why we value it so much.
Same goes for a talented person.
If you value him,
he will make you proud
but if you humiliate him,
he will wound you.
Hence, we should never
insult a talented person.
My ethics, your destiny.
You want to teach me the ways to rule.
You want to snatch
my throne away from me.
You want to dethrone me!

The winner of this competition
is the representative of Magadha
King Dhananand's warrior
Chandragupta.
- Hail Chandragupta!
- Hail!
- Hail King Dhananand!
- Hail!
- Hail Chandragupta!
- Hail!
Now, according to the condition
set before the competition
the King of Greece, Seleucus
will announce something
in front of you all!
'I, King Seleucus'
'accept my defeat'
'from King Dhananand
and Magadha's prowess'
'on the land of Magadha.'
'The great emperor Dhananand
is a trove of knowledge.'
'He is more powerful and courageous'
'than thousands of lions.'
'His strength can
not only crush a human'
'but also a mighty mountain.'
'And..'
Keep speaking, my friend Seleucus.
I am listening to you carefully.
Keep speaking..
'And..'
'All the praise in the world'
'is not enough to praise
the King of Magadha.'
'I accept'
'that under the rule
of King Dhananand'
'the Kingdom of Magadha is safe'
'and the kingdom does not
need anyone's help to safeguard it.'
'I accept that King Dhananand'
'should remain invincible'
'and rule over the entire world.'
'I, Seleucus, accept my defeat.'
'The King of Magadha was'
'is and will always
remain the best of all.'
- Hail King Dhananand!
- Hail!
- Hail King Dhananand!
- Hail!
- Hail King Dhananand!
- Hail!
- Hail King Dhananand!
- Hail!
- Hail King Dhananand!
- Hail!
Amazing! Acharya, you are amazing!
Today, I got to know
why people call you cunning.
Your strategy was amazing!
You used one diamond
to mesmerise three people.
You turned Dhananand and
Seleucus against each other.
And Chandra..
You have indebted Chandra again.
I praise your intelligence
and diplomacy.
Indeed! Even if Chandra
does not accept it
but we trust your foresight and you.
Yes, Acharya.
Now, you are near
your goal to unite India.
Am I right, Stulbhadra?
Yes. What had Chandra said?
'Hey, Brahmin with unbraided hair!'
'Our paths can never be one.'
But today, his historic
victory has changed everything.
You have saved Chandra's life.
Tell us, Acharya.
What is your next plan for Chandra?
What will be the new
path that you show him?
Tell us, Acharya.
The path
that will take him to
the origin of his existence.
Because until Chandragupta's curiosity
to know about his mother is abated
it will be impossible to
make him love his motherland.
So, now..
Now, that journey will start
which will awaken the responsibilities
that Chandra has towards his mother
and his motherland.
I wanted to punish you.
But your victory
has delighted me.
Your victory has
not only made me proud
but also shown Seleucus his worth.
I had to win, Your Majesty
because the question was
not of my victory or defeat.
Your dignity was at stake.
Until I am alive
your dignity will never be tarnished.
Well said!
There is still a problem
between us and that is..
It is an obstacle.
Seleucus tasked you
with stealing the diamond
but you could not tell me the truth
as you had no direct way to reach me.
So, I am presenting
you with this bangle.
After wearing it
you can meet me whenever you want.
Not only that
but using this bangle you
can reach me whenever you want.
Now, there will be no formality
or obstacle between us.
Your mercy is unmatched, Your Majesty.
Thank you.
Hail King Dhananand..
Hail King Dhananand..
Before this competition
there were a few people
who completely believed that
you would die during the competition.
But you
proved my belief and
foresight to be true!
If you want anything
apart from this gift
ask away without hesitating.
If you permit me
may I take
a few days off?
I want it as I have
some important work
that needs to be completed.
Work?
Leave?
Is dethroning me
your important work?
You want to teach me the ways to rule.
You want to snatch
my throne away from me.
You want to dethrone me!
No!
I cannot even dream
about dethroning you!
You know that you can dream about it
as you have all the qualities,
but you will not!
That is because you are not a fool.
Undoubtedly, Your Majesty.
Only a foolish person
will try to take your place.
Y-You
are Magadha's God.
Moreover, who can take
a God's place?
Well said! Go
and come back after
completing your work
Chandragupta.
Amazing, Acharya!
You are an artist!
However, I wonder why you are wasting
your time and art after fools like us.
Yes, Acharya.
Why do you not turn your
art into a source of income?
We will exhibit your artwork.
People from all over the world
will come to buy these pieces of art.
They will praise them.
And you..
You will become famous, Acharya.
Forgive me,
Acharya, but I am in a hurry.
I want to thank you for
helping me out in the arena.
Chandra! Why are you in a hurry?
Come and see this.
He has spent the entire
night to make this piece of art.
Only the last stage is left. Come.
Amazing!
Acharya, your piece of art is amazing.
You are truly insane, Acharya.
You worked so hard all night
and you made such a beautiful design
and yet you ruined it in an instant.
Why?
Had I not destroyed it,
it would have destroyed me.
The arrogance of making
such a beautiful thing
would've got to my head.
I would think of
myself as the creator.
Such a great creator
that can create anything.
And this arrogance would've
lead me to my ruin.
I understand.
You are telling me
that I must not be arrogant
after having defeated Desmond.
Do not let any achievement of yours
become your identity, Chandragupta.
Or else it will take
away your identity from you.
It will affect the manner
in which think and decide.
It will fill you with arrogance
that you can do the impossible.
Some impossible tasks that
you are not equipped to do yet.
Just as you are..
As you are thinking
of going to Piplivan.
What?
How did you know
that I was thinking
of going to Piplivan?
You did not come here just to thank me
while carrying the
royal emblem of Piplivan.
But let me tell you,
before you even ask.
Going there is a very dangerous task
Are you feeling proud, my love?
Your son has won his first battle.
His first victory against
that invader Seleucus!
Soon will dawn the day
when my Chandra will defeat
the greatest enemy of the land!
He will slay Dhananand!
Even today, after so many years
I can still see that
moment in front of me!
How Dhananand had blocked
all routes to Piplivan
after defeating Piplivan!
So that Piplivan was cut off
from the rest of the world!
And that the clan of warriors die
a slow death
while reminiscing their
glory and prosperity.
Acharya Chanakya.
The answers to my mother's
whereabouts are in Piplivan.
I must go there.
Acharya.
Acharya, I understand now
that you help people according
to their desires and you help them.
So tell me at once.
How should I reach Piplivan?
When asking for help,
one must be polite.
So, Acharya Chanakya!
Will you please use your
radiant knowledge to illuminate
my path to Piplivan?
Did you not like that?
Acharya.
Only you are able to help me.
Please guide me.
Help me reach Piplivan.
Agreed. I will help
you reach Piplivan.
Thank you, Acharya. Thank you.
But for that you have to steal
something before going on the quest.
What? I have to steal again?
You wanted to make me an Emperor
and now you're turning
me into a thief?
The kingdom that was
once known as the symbol
and mark of supremacy
of the warriors and prosperity
now lies trapped in
the darkness of misery.
Even the birds fear
making a nest in there
but Chandra has rekindled
and strengthened my faith.
As long as I am alive, I will fight
every hazard and adversity
that comes my way
so that I can see the
day when my son, our son
gets united to his
roots and his existence.
And he will bring the
glory back to Piplivan.
Not just Piplivan but
he will avenge all atrocities
that Dhananand has subjected,
by making Dhananand pay for it!
Our Chandragupta!
People travel together to remain safe.
It is good.
Travelling in numbers
keeps people safe.
But this very group
takes away your identity.
Since you walk the
path led by someone else.
One has to walk alone
to pave one's own path.
Stars often exists in numbers
but it is the Sun that is worshipped.
Since the sun walks alone.
One must endure, rise
and tackle odds.
And only then one can
forge an identity for oneself
and only then one is respected.
A lesson from me
and actions from you.
Chandragupta,
if you want to go to Piplivan
then it is important to steal the
image of that place from that book.
The Piplivan page has been torn off.
Who can it be who wants
to go to Piplivan, Amatya?

================================================================================

Episode: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOO9HVX-7m8

'The secret to the path of Piplivan'
'has carefully been hid
in the library of Dhananand.'
'Dhananand does not want'
'anybody to go to Piplivan
or know anything about that place.'
'His only aim'
is to wipe out the existence
and identity of Piplivan'
'from the face of this earth' and
also from the minds of the people.'
'From the map of India,
he has wiped out Pippalivana.'
'When there is no image of
Piplivan then one cannot go there.'
'Chandragupta,
if you want to go to Piplivan'
'then it is important to steal the
image of that place from that book.'
I have to think of something
regarding that slave.
I must have a plan or some
tactics by which I can defeat him.
Have this apple, Princess.
An apple a day keeps
all the worries away.
I heard some kind of a sound.
What.. What is this slave
doing here at this hour?
He had asked for some
time off from my brother.
In his spare time, he wants
to spend his time in the library.
He will become a knowledgeable man,
Princess.
Thank you, Princess Durdhara.
Actually, I was hungry.
Better have this apple
and spend the entire night.
Princess!
Let me come out, Princess!
Spend the entire night
studying and gain some knowledge.
Get some knowledge
during this time, slave!
He will be spending the
entire night in the library.
Make sure nobody opens the door.
Why does that princess
always interfere in my path?
How will I go out?
An emblem of Piplivan?
So this is the image which
will guide to the lost Piplivan.
This is the path which
will lead to Piplivan.
Sometimes tacky people
also help without knowing it.
Thank you, Princess Durdhara.
That slave just screamed.
It seems he is in trouble.
I do not care.
But Princess, do not forget that he
holds a special place with the Emperor.
If something happens to him
a lot of questions will crop up.
Slave.
Slave.
Slave.
Are you looking for me, Princess?
Slave..
Open the door, slave.
I said, open the door!
Better spend the night in there.
Tell me the experience you go through.
There are a lot of books
if you know how to read.
Slave, this is not right.
Open the door!
Have a pleasant night.
Slave!
What..
What brings you here?
Chandragupta, you are forgetting
that this land is my mother.
And a son always knows
everything about his mother.
I am aware of all
the secret paths here.
What!
The creator of an independent India
if you already knew all these paths
why did you make me steal this map?
You could have imparted
your knowledge earlier itself
and told me the way to Piplivan
and how I can reach there.
Besides, this map is of no use to me.
This does not contain
any route to Piplivan.
To become a king you
do not need just vision
but a perspective too.
But you have only vision now.
No problem.
Your perspective will
also change very soon.
This map contains all the information
which can lead you to Piplivan.
But it is not visible directly.
It is present secretly.
If Dhananand wants to keep it a secret
it is obvious that
it must be written in code.
I have studied it carefully.
It does not contain anything.
Have you ever wondered
why we cannot see our nose?
Because the nose is
exactly between the eyes.
You need to concentrate to see it.
You need to change your perspective.
- Light the fire.
- What!
As you say, the learned one.
It is done.
No.
Do not burn this too.
Do not worry. I am not burning it.
Just how gold burns
in the fire to take form
similarly, this map will also be
visible only after getting some heat.
Look at this.
An old method of sending
secret messages or information.
A special ink is used
which becomes invisible
after some time.
It becomes visible
after getting some heat.
What does it say?
A riddle is written on this map.
'The sun shines on a
night that has the moonlight.'
'There is darkness everywhere.'
'There is light only in one place.'
'A path caught between day
and night is crowded by tourists.'
'Someone who travelled
day and night for a whole month.'
What!
What could this mean?
'The sun shines on a
night that has the moonlight.'
'There is darkness everywhere.'
'There is light only in one place.'
This is impossible.
'Someone who travelled
day and night for a whole month.'
What nonsense is this?
I think this is your illusion.
Look at it carefully.
I told you what is
written on this map.
You will find an answer to
this riddle once you reach Piplivan.
If you know the answer,
why can you not tell me now?
Why are you waiting for
me to reach my destination?
Because the journey is sometimes
more important than the destination,
Chandragupta.
I will pray to God
that may your journey
be easy and successful.
But yes, be careful about one thing.
Do not choose the shorter path in
order to reach your destination sooner.
That path is not safe.
You can find man-eating beings there.
Wait.. Please wait!
Have a safe journey, Chandragupta.
I am stuck here.
There is this dangerous
riddle on one side.
On the other hand, that Brahmin.
And there is King
Dhananand on another side.
Amatya!
A kingdom is similar to this boat
which contains many holes
that tries to drown
the ruler and his kingdom.
These holes are my enemies
who are trying to harm
me and my identity repeatedly.
He wants to capture my throne.
Seleucus has been defeated.
'I, Seleucus, accept defeat.'
The thief who dared to break
my statue received his punishment.
The farmer who dared to
mutiny has been sentenced to death
and slave Mura serves me.
I can kill her anytime I wish.
But I still wonder about the people
who dared to attack my sister.
Do not worry, Your Majesty.
I will surely identify them.
Take a look.
I have mended the
leakage of this boat.
Along with that, I have
thrown the accumulated water off.
Trust me.
Every person who means
trouble to the kingdom
will have to cross over my dead body.
I never leave any task incomplete.
You can trust me.
Are you sure,
you have completed the task
assigned to you?
There is still one hole in that boat.
Likewise, there is a mole
who wants to harm me.
He is right
under your nose.
'You have insulted my braid.'
'I swear by it'
'that I will eliminate your clan,
Dhananand.'
'I will dethrone you'
'to have an able person as a king.'
Vishnugupta Chanakya.
Yes, Amatya.
He is the one.
He is the loose end
who is yet to be tied up because
you never really bothered about him.
But now I know.
He cannot escape for long,
Your Majesty.
I swear on Lord!
I will move heaven
and earth to find him.
Your Majesty, Queen Durdhara
has been locked in the royal library.
Make sure nobody moves
from their positions.
Nobody shall open the doors.
I do not want any interference.
As you command, Your Majesty.
- Durdhara.
- Brother.
- Are you fine?
- Yes.
Who dared to do this?
I do not think anybody
is responsible for this.
What do you mean?
I wanted to read poems.
Therefore, I came here
at the library with Shipra.
While reading the book,
I went far into the chamber
away from anybody's sight.
Somebody might have closed the
door assuming the room to be vacant.
Nobody is to be blamed for this,
Brother.
I should have been more cautious.
Durdhara,
are you telling me the truth?
What do you mean, Brother?
How dare anybody
lock the princess inside the library!
Fine.
You may leave, Sister. Get some rest.
I will not let brother
punish him for his act.
I will punish him on my own.
Someone came here. Look around you.
Someone has studied a lot here..
That too in a very short span of time.
He may have wanted to find something,
Your Majesty.
Look, Your Majesty.
The Piplivan page has been torn off.
Someone wants to know about Piplivan.
Who can it be who wants
to go to Piplivan, Amatya?
What is the difference
between a master and a slave?
Both are humans.
While a slave tries
to protect his master
he in turn protects his slaves.
Both of them discharge
their respective duty.
What is the reason
that the master
gets the right to wear the crown
and his slaves are
offered to sit by his feet?
A purblind leads a normal life
but a visionary
is remembered even after his death.
It all boils down to perspective.
A person with a great vision
and foresight
ascends the throne.
So, one must think of consequences
before taking any call.
It depends on your perception
if you will get glorified
or be humiliated.
The principles are mine
but the choices are yours.
The king wants Piplivan
to remain hidden from this world
but that servant is
on his way to that place.
By being curious about Piplivan
he has challenged
King Dhananand's glory fame and power!
Find that slave and kill him.

Intelligent and capable
courtiers of Magadha.
Tell me..
Who stole the map of Piplivan
and why?
Your Majesty, I know
that you do not value my opinion.
After thinking critically
about all the facts
and evidence, I came to the conclusion
that this was done
by the one you trust.
The servant, Chandragupta.
I agree with him, Your Majesty.
Brother Pandup,
you were saying something.
Keep talking.. I am listening.
That servant is misleading you,
Your Majesty.
I believe he is so close to you
that your ministers are
neither able to survey his actions
nor are they able to
give you proper advice.
That is why his deeds
are ignored all the time.
Instead of being punished
he is pardoned and promoted.
He needs punishment
and not your mercy.
The capital punishment.
Are you done?
Are you done, Brother?
I thought that you would never stop
talking out of hatred and jealousy.
- Your Majesty, I..
- Silence!
Be silent, Brother.
I regret that you are the
elder brother of the King of Magadha.
You cannot even come out and say
you hate that child and
want to exact revenge from him.
I cut off one finger of yours
and now, you are raising
all your fingers against him.
You..
Keep up with your
jealousy and that servant
will keep doing new and intrinsic
things to keep me entertained.
Once, he returned the
head of my golden statue.
Once, he stole a diamond.
'Your Majesty, I was the one
who stole your precious diamond.'
Then he won against a tiger!
And now, he has stolen the
map of Piplivan from my library.
Such peculiar acts one after another
that entertain me a lot!
Look at what he has stolen this time.
If he has stolen the map of Piplivan
it gives rise to the question
that why he wants to go to Piplivan.
Will he be able to
do this impossible task?
Will he be able to cross
that dangerous and tough path
and reach Piplivan alive?
Amatya..
- Do you get it?
- Yes, Your Majesty.
I understood you.
For the fools like Acharya Chanakya
this forest is truly
dangerous and frightening.
Oh, dangerous forest!
If danger is lurking inside you,
bring it to me!
Or else, the great and wise,
Acharya Chanakya will feel offended.
His prediction has proved to be false.
Hey..
Hey, there..
It's such a dangerous animal!
So, this is the man-eater
he was talking about.
If there are more
animals like you here
tell them that I am here.
And yes, if you find that
cunning Brahmin with loose hair
run for your lives.
He is the most dangerous
person in this world.
You may go now.
I have to calm down.
I am yet to know the truth
about Piplivan and my mother.
For that, I need to stay alive.
I need to calm down.
Both of you are the
best informers of Magadha.
That is why I have asked
you to take up this difficult task.
The king wants Piplivan
to remain hidden from this world
but that servant is
on his way to that place.
I am coming, Piplivan
to uncover the secrets of my past
that you are hiding amongst
your desolate streets.
By being curious about Piplivan
he has challenged King
Dhananand's glory fame and power!
I will not let him do that.
That place has been
inaccessible for 12 years.
This situation must stay the same
until Piplivan is
completely destroyed!
I do not care if that
slave lives or dies.
But make sure you do
this job as soon as possible.
Or else, you know the consequence.
Go!
I heard the neigh of a horse here.
Those are the soldiers from Magadha.
So, the king knows that I am here.
I should not traverse this path.
'Do remember this.'
'Do not take the shortcut
to reach your destination.'
'That route is not safe.'
'Man-eating animals
may lurk that path.'
Is this the path he mentioned about?
Forgive me, Brahmin.
You warned me not to take this path.
But I do not have any other option.
I have to do this to save
myself from these informers.
Our job ends here.
He has invited his death
by choosing this path.
Let us convey this good
news to Amatya Rakshas.
He will never be able
to make it to Piplivan.
Let us go.
You are of no use to me, my friend.
Acharya.
Maitri, what brings you here?
What information do you have?
Acharya, it is becoming
difficult to control Queen Mura.
She is insisting on meeting you.
Why can she not understand
that meeting her now
can create problems for us?
Especially, when Amatya Rakshas
has decided to catch me.
Beware!
Who are you?
Queen Mura?
You should not have come here.
Your presence here
can create problems.
Acharya,
no problem matters for a mother
when her son's life is in danger.
Why did you do this?
Why did you send Chandra
despite knowing the dangers lurking
in Pippalivana and its path?
Now, even Dhananand has found
out that Chandragupta has gone there
and he has sent dangerous
killers after him.
You know that nobody
has returned alive
from the path Chandra has chosen.
I know.
But if he wants to become
the future king of united India
he will have to return
victorious from there.
Lady Mura, do not abridge your
thoughts due to your motherly love
that it makes you see
Chandragupta only as your son.
He is the heritage of India.
He is the future protector
of this motherland.
So, understand this very clearly.
In the great journey
which Chandragupta
has embarked to become
the king of united India
he will come across many
problems and difficulties.
If he succeeds in overcoming
the darkness of those problems
only then can he bring
brightness to the sky of India.
Chandragupta will face many problems
and obstacles in this journey
that he will have to cross on his own.
That too, alone.
Alone?
So, you will not help
him in this process.
A person who needs
my help at every step
does not have the right to become
the future king of united India.
This is Chandragupta's test,
Lady Mura.
He will face many problems
and difficulties on this path.
And he will have to find a solution
to every problem on his own.
I will not help him in this process
and I will not let
you help him either.
Let me drink some water.
Acharya, I can feel it.
My son, Chandra, is in danger.
Perhaps..
Perhaps, I should have revealed to him
that I am his unfortunate mother
about whom he kept asking me.
I have sent him Piplivan
to find out this truth.
What?
But why?
You could have told
him about his past here!
Why did you put his life at risk?
Neither you told him
nor did you let me reveal.
Why did you send him to Piplivan?
Why!
Because I wanted him to feel the pain
of not only his mother
but his motherland as well.
Every corner of the place
where Chandragupta is going today
will tell him about
Dhananand's cruelty.
Today, he will face a bitter
yet complete truth.
He will realise
that Dhananand not
only attacked his mother
but he destroyed his
whole empire as well.
The signs of destruction in Piplivan?
tell him about the sufferings
of his mother and his motherland.
Then Chandragupta will realise
that if he does not
take the initiative
of putting an end to the
atrocities of this dictator
the many empires like
Piplivan will be destroyed
and many women like
you will be enslaved.
Many innocents like
Chandragupta will be trafficked.
I agree that I allowed
him to go alone.
I did it because we realise
our true self only in solitude
and not in the presence of anyone.
Acharya, you are heartless.
The one who transforms
a piece of iron into a sword
has to burn it in the fire
and then mould it further
by hitting it heartlessly.
That is when you can make a sword.
If we want to end cruel
emperors like Dhananand
we have to make Chandragupta stronger.
And to do that, I accept
to be a heartless taskmaster.
In the soil of Piplivan
Chandragupta will hear
the cries of innocent children
and the screams of helpless women.
He will see the remains of the dead.
That air will make
him realise the anguish
of hundreds of innocents and soldiers.
And when he realises that
it will shake his conscience up.
Chandragupta will realise
that he is not a slave
and that will transform him
into the future king of united India.
The king who will fight
for his country and motherland
and not for his self-interest.
It will be the death of Chandragupta,
the servant
and the rise of Chandragupta
Maurya the emperor.
It is true that friends
fill happiness in our life.
But the same closeness with them
can make you careless.
Friends appreciate
the good things in you
and increase your self-confidence.
This makes you go further
away from the truth.
Whereas, the enemy will
highlight the bad things in you
and compel you to work on yourself.
He will keep you alert.
That will make
you more conscious about
the conspiracies against you.
Friendship is life
but to make sure that life is safe
keep your enemies
closer than your friends.
My ethics.. Your destiny.
Today, I, a Kshatriya
woman am not here to beg You
but to ask You to promise me
that You would protect my son,
Chandra.

================================================================================

Episode: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjcYbbMoU7k

Lord Shiva, one Chandra
is adorning Your forehead as a crown
and another Chandra
is my son
whose life is in danger today.
If my son, Chandra
is hurt today
then it will tarnish
Your crown as well.
Today, I, a Kshatriya
woman am not here to beg You
but to ask You to promise me
that You would protect my son,
Chandra.
No.. No..
The heir of Piplivan
shall not die. Never!
You will have to bring
my son back to me safe and sound.
The wrath of Your 'Tandava'
rains down destruction upon the world.
But if You do not
safeguard my son today
then You will face the wrath
of my anger, Lord Shiva!
"He solves all the problems.
He does the impossible."
"He solves all the problems.
He does the impossible."
"You can turn a weak
person into strong."
"The world says that about You."
"Oh, the dweller of Kailash..
The wielder of a trident.."
"One who bestows prosperity..
The carrier of river Ganga!"
"The conqueror of death..
The benevolent God.."
"The Lord who embodies the cosmos."
"Oh, Lord, You are the Almighty."
"You apply ash over your body and
are the epitome of auspiciousness."
"Lord Shiva, You are the
greatest of all the deities."
"You express Your wrath
through 'Tandava' and bring"
"upon the destruction of evil."
"You are the source of life as well!"
I understood Your sign.
I understood, Lord Shiva.
You..
You did not let me face defeat.
'So, this is the path to Piplivan.'
It seems
that terrible bloodshed happened here.
But why?
Why do I feel that
I know of this place?
As if I have been here before.
What had happened here?
These ruins
indicate towards a prosperous past.
I will have to enter this fort.
Perhaps, I will find the
answers to my questions here
for which I am here.
Acharya just tried
to intimidate me by saying
that there would be guards here
but I do not see any.
There might be ghosts though.
The ghosts of these dead people.
Acharya was right.
Despite no guards
Dhananand's invisible
barrier safeguards this place.
I will not be able to
walk out of this place alive.
I must find another way.
According to the map
there is one more gate.
Perhaps this is where
the secret door is.
This is a dead-end?
How is this possible?
Is it possible that Emperor
Dhananand had this place shut down?
'The sun shines on a
night that has the moonlight.'
'There is darkness everywhere.'
'There is light only in one place.'
'A path caught between day
and night is crowded by tourists.'
'Someone who travelled
day and night for a whole month.'
This means
in order to open this secret door
I must solve that riddle first.
'The sun shines on
a night that has the moonlight.'
It implies that there
must be something here
that can help me
open this secret gate.
Found it!
The second part of the riddle.
'There is darkness everywhere.'
'There is light only in one place.'
There is darkness everywhere.
There is light only in one place.
The final part of the riddle.
'A path caught between day
and night is crowded by tourists.'
'Someone who travelled
day and night for a whole month.'
So, just the way the
moon and earth orbit the sun
similarly
I must put this here
and start rotating it.
Why does this place look familiar?
Why does it seem
like..
Like I have
been here before!
Who am I?
Who is my mother?
How am I connected to this place?
Is there an answer
to this riddle of my life?
Is there an answer? What is it?
Is there an answer?
This is surely
the portrait of the
royal family of Piplivan.
The King, and Queen Mura..
And their son!
The Prince of Piplivan, Veerbhadra.
How is my mother's bangle
on Queen Mura's wrists?
What does this mean?
[Sanskrit shlok]
[Sanskrit shlok]
The lion is the king of the jungle.
But just because it
is a king it does not imply
that it has the luxury to rest
while the deer walks up
to the lion to sacrifice itself.
In order to display authority
the lion must roar!
In order to sustain its powers
the lion must work
hard and hunt its prey.
The key is to work hard.
Only with efforts
does a man become king.
Hence, never look away from hard-work
because if you do that
it will take moments to
become a servant from a king.
These are my principles.
Make the right choice.
Impossible! How did he survive?

================================================================================

Episode: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZ7YvjzEzXY

'Mother!'
'Mother!'
Why are you staring at me
as if you have seen a ghost?
Because no one comes here anymore.
No one has come here for 12 years.
Today, when I saw you here..
Well.. What are you
doing here at this time?
- I think you are lost.
- Yes.
You can say that.
By the way,
for how long have you been here?
I have been here for long.
It was a time when
Piplivan was not a ruin.
It was considered
the symbol of Kshatriya pride.
It was a time when Piplivan
was praised for its glory
and not that cruel Dhananand.
It was a time when this place
was alive with laughter and joy
and not drowning in pain and sorrows.
I have been here since that time.
Is that so?
So, you must
know them.
He is Piplivan's late king,
Chandravardhan.
She is Piplivan's queen, Mura.
And he is Piplivan's prince
Chandragupta Maurya.
What?
What? What is the name of the prince?
Chandragupta Maurya.
The last scion of the Kshatriya Clan.
The last heir
of the Maurya Dynasty.
The prince of Piplivan,
Chandragupta Maurya.
'Chandragupta Maurya.'
'He is the last scion
of the Kshatriya Clan.'
'The last heir of the Maurya Dynasty.'
'The prince of Piplivan,
Chandragupta Maurya.'
'Stop..'
'Mother!'
'This is the armour and
sword of the King of Piplivan.'
'He had defied King Dhananand.'
No!
'You cannot sit here.
That is your seat.'
'I accept my defeat
from King Dhananand'
'and Magadha's prowess
on the land of Magadha.'
Water!
I said, bring me water!
Did you see what happened here?
I, the King of Macedonia
had to call upon a mere soldier
twice, and that too, for water!
I will decapitate
him right away, sire.
Who all will you decapitate, Nicanor?
A king's victory
not only makes his enemies
bow before him but also his soldiers.
And because of my defeat
my people are losing
their fear and respect for me.
This is because of that arrogant,
Dhananand.
The way he has humiliated me..
Because of that,
I am losing my influence
upon my people.
No, I cannot go back to Takshashila.
Then what do you wish to do, sire?
Respect.
I want to regain
my lost dignity and pride
and show Dhananand his right place.
Write a letter
to King Dhananand that before leaving
I wish to play another game
to celebrate our friendship.
I will choose
that game and its players.
Sire, a friendly game?
Yes.
But under the disguise
of this friendly game
I will take revenge for the game
that Dhananand played with me.
'Why do you keep scolding me
the way a mother does?'
'I wish I were your mother.'
'Then I would have taught you better
manners that your mother did not.'
'I am a Kshatriya woman.'
'I am Piplivan's queen.'
'You are not Piplivan's prince.'
'I am perhaps the only
person in this world'
'who can introduce
you to your mother.'
I am happy to see you safe,
Chandragupta.
You knew everything, did you not?
Mura..
The woman who has been
a servant to Dhananand for years
and has been subjected
to his cruelty..
That woman is my mother.
She is Piplivan's queen.
You knew everything, did you not?
Still, you kept teaching me.
You taught me how our motherland
is most important for us.
How I should be loyal
to my motherland!
'Our birth mother is
not the only mother we know.'
'Even our motherland
is akin to our mother.'
Every time.. Every moment.
You kept stopping me
from knowing about my past.
Who gave you the right
to play with anyone's emotions
whenever and however you want?
You have to become the ruler
of united India, Chandragupta.
Whatever I did
was for making you realise
the responsibilities
and duties of a king.
Because independent India
must be ruled by a wise king.
Enough!
Enough of your lecture
on independent India.
Not anymore!
How many times do I explain that
I am not interested in your dream?
Neither do I wish to be an emperor.
And you are least interested
in this motherland
or me being an emperor.
You only want to fix
your shattered ego.
In the name of this dream
you are seeking revenge
from King Dhananand.
So stop this pretense
and deception about
an independent India.
Chandragupta!
Do not insult my dedication
by calling it my ego.
I do not care what
happens in this world
but one thing is a
fact that there is nothing
more important to
me than my motherland.
Your motherland, your oath, your dream
is all about you!
You are incapable
of forgetting yourself
for once and thinking of others.
Have you ever
thought about the feelings
of anyone except your own?
When I went to the palace of Piplivan
I..
I heard the scream of my mother.
I heard the cruel laughter
of the King!
And while I parted from my mother
I could recollect the trauma
from my childhood.
And you have no idea
how much pain this caused me.
Because you do not care
about anyone's feelings.
When you went to Piplivan
you could think about your
mother and your childhood trauma
but did you not hear
the cries of soldiers
who gave up their lives
to protect the honour
of Piplivan?
What about the helpless
children, women
and people who were killed
by that cruel Dhananand?
Did you hear the cries
of the motherland?
The cries that clearly
state that it needs freedom
- from the rule of Dhananand?
- No.
Because, I do not care
about the motherland.
Right now
I only wish to meet my mother
and ask her why she lied
to me for so long.
So go on and impart
your knowledge elsewhere.
Chandragupta,
the palace that your mother is in
belongs to the King of Magadha,
Dhananand.
He is the one who knows
that you stole the map to Piplivan.
A well-thought decision
needs to be made
but you are not mentally
prepared for it
because you cannot
tell the right from wrong
so until you control
your anger you cannot leave.
I will certainly go to the palace
and demand an explanation from mother.
Let me make something very clear,
Acharya.
I call you Acharya
but you mean nothing to me.
So you have no authority
over my decision.
Surprising!
Despite being insultingly defeated in
a challenge you have returned to offer
a competition, Seleucus.
Because I thought that
the alliance I expect to make
creates fond memories
for me for the future.
So that I keep this
in my memories, forever.
And what can be more
memorable than a game?
I am certain that you will enjoy
this game.
The rules of the game
will be explained by Amatya.
The rules are as follows..
There are two teams, one of Macedonia
and the other is Magadha.
A player of one team will step
into the border of the opposite team
and touch its players
and the one who returns safe
after doing that will be scored based
on the number of people he touched
and the ones touched
will be eliminated.
But keep in mind.
The player that is caught
by the rivals will be eliminated.
And the player who stands till the end
will be the winner of this game.
Let the games begin.
Kabaddi.. Kabaddi..
Kabaddi.. Kabaddi..
Kabaddi.. Kabaddi..
Kabaddi.. Kabaddi..
Catch him!
Don't let him escape. Catch him.
Kabaddi.. Kabaddi..
Catch him!
Kabaddi..
In the beginning of the game
Macedonia scores a point.
Relax, Your Majesty.
This is just a game. Enjoy!
Certainly.
Kabaddi.. Kabaddi..
Kabaddi.. Kabaddi..
Kabaddi.. Kabaddi..
Kabaddi.. Kabaddi..
Kabaddi.. Kabaddi..
And one player of
team Magadha is down.
He is eliminated.
Macedonia is at 2,
while Magadha stays at 0.
Kabaddi.. Kabaddi..
Kabaddi.. Kabaddi..
- Don't let him go.
- Kabaddi.. Kabaddi..
Kabaddi.. Kabaddi..
- Kabaddi.. Kabaddi..
- Catch him!
Come on, catch him!
Kabaddi.. Kabaddi..
Kabaddi.. Kabaddi..
Kabaddi.. Kabaddi..
Kabaddi.. Kabaddi..
Kabaddi.. Kabaddi..
Kabaddi.. Kabaddi..
Team Macedonia is clearly in a lead
with 5 points,
while Magadha is still at 0.
Amatya!
What is happening?
Why is our team losing?
Pardon me, Your Majesty
but I chose the best
players of Magadha.
It seems the players
of Macedonia are better.
The last player of Magadha
will play against the rival team.
Amatya, why is there
such a weak player here?
I can see fear in his eyes,
he is incapable of anything.
"Chandragupta! Chandragupta!"
Impossible! How did he survive?
To achieve one's purpose
one's soul needs the body.
If the mortal form is destroyed
one's existence in
the society is gone.
Hence it is the duty of every being
to protect its body and
make it stronger by being healthy.
A healthy body keeps
your mind healthy too.
And only a healthy mind can help you
achieve physical and spiritual goals.
Respect your body.
Only then will it come to use to you.
These are my principles.
Make the right choice.

================================================================================

Episode: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Of9T8NR15k

Your Majesty,
I apologise that the last player
of Magadha's team has gotten
injured with my catapult.
But I am prepared to
pay the price for that.
With your permission,
I would like to lead
Magadha's team in his place.
- But you..
- Of course.
You have my permission.
Come!
Kabaddi.. Kabaddi..
Kabaddi.. Kabaddi..
Kabaddi.. Kabaddi..
Kabaddi.. Kabaddi..
Kabaddi.. Kabaddi.. Kabaddi..
'Mura, the prince
of Piplivan is here.'
'He must be tired.'
'Make arrangements to wash his feet.'
Kabaddi.. Kabaddi..
Kabaddi.. Kabaddi.. Kabaddi..
Kabaddi.. Kabaddi.. Kabaddi..
Kabaddi.. Kabaddi.. Kabaddi..
Kabaddi.. Kabaddi..
Magadha gets six points.
Macedonia loses to
Magadha by six points!
Yes! Yes..
Long live Chandragupta!
Long live Chandragupta!
Long live Chandragupta!
Long live Chandragupta!
Long live Chandragupta!
Long live Chandragupta!
What happened, King of Greeks?
It was a game. Take it as such.
I think, the game was everything
to you other than being just a game.
Right?
It seems to me that you wanted to take
revenge for your humiliation
but you lost. It is okay.
You have my best wishes with you.
You might defeat someday but right now
just accept your defeat.
What was it that you said?
Oh, yes!
Take pleasure!
So, Chandragupta. Why do you think
you have been summoned here?
Will the court reward you
for your performance in the game
or punish you for stealing
in the palace again?
Your Majesty,
in the past few days, my life
has taken many dramatic turns.
From an ordinary slave, I became
a security guard of the royal family.
I never knew when
the chains of slavery
turned into a bracelet by His Majesty.
Due to your trust and blessings,
I am constantly progressing.
So it is my duty to serve you
as much as I can in return.
When I heard about Piplivan
and its destruction..
The way you destroyed
all the paths leading to it..
That reaching that place
was not only insurmountable
but also impossible.
So I got curious
that I should check
the security over there.
With that objective,
I stole the map from your library
and challenged myself so that I could
overcome lots of limits within myself.
Because you had entrusted
a slave with an important
responsibility as a security guard.
I did not have any training for that.
So I decided to make
this journey a training regime
and learn from all my obstructions.
Because no training centre
could give me such training.
You are so small but you think so big!
So are you trying to
say that you reached Piplivan?
Yes, Your Majesty.
I have witnessed it with my own eyes
that all the relics
of that country are naught
compared to your bravery
and have been destroyed.
I have witnessed it
myself the way you bathed
that nation with blood year
ago to make it subservient to you.
It was a proud nation in the past.
Today it bows down
to your predominance.
Today it is same as dust.
Your Majesty, the slave is lying.
Shamdev, tell His Majesty.
Your Majesty, he is lying.
He did not even reach Piplivan.
We had seen him go towards the
forest from where no human can return.
He might have come out of the forest.
But he could not
have reached Piplivan.
Because, as per your orders
I had made tight security
arrangements in Piplivan.
Chandragupta, there you go.
The security head of Piplivan
speaks with such conviction
that you are lying.
And what if I present
a proof that supports my claims?
I reached not just
the kingdom of Piplivan
I even broke through the
security and entered the palace.
I have the proof of that.
What happened, slave?
This is the picture
of Piplivan's royal family
which I found in that
inaccessible mansion.
And this slave, Mura
can confirm this.
If Chandra decides anything,
he will do that at any cost.
But Acharya, what you told Chandra
which has made him so angry?
It is not important
what Acharya told Chandra.
It is important whether Chandra has been
able to learn about his past or not.
- Acharya, who is his mother?
- Please tell us, Acharya.
Chandragupta is the
prince of Piplivan.
Jokes do not sound
good from your mouth.
Chandra pretended to
be the prince of Piplivan.
Because Emperor Dhananand
made him the prince for one day.
- He is not the real..
- He is.
He is a prince.
He is the last heir of Maurya dynasty
and the son Piplivan's
ex-king Chandravardhan
and his queen, Mura.
I was aware of his past.
But I wanted Chandragupta
to learn about this on his own.
And he is aware of his past now.
P-Prince..
This means,
he is the son of a king and a queen
who stay in a palace.
He is the heir of a royal family.
And royal blood runs
through his veins.
Yes.
Acharya, Chandra has gone to
the palace after learning about this!
Acharya, you have to do something.
God knows what he will do there.
It is impossible to predict
when he will go crazy.
A new chapter of
Chandragupta's life has begun
after he came to know about his past.
I tried to stop him
but he did not listen to me.
Now, whatever will happen
to him in the palace..
He needs to face that on his own.
But, Acharya..
The one who will lead
the entire nation one day
has to realise this
that not only his actions
and decisions affects himself
but also the subjects
and the entire nation.
Chandragupta is right.
He had gone to Piplivan.
And there is no doubt about it.
Mura
this picture reflects your good time.
Mura, am I right?
Give her this picture.
So that she can shed
tears over her misfortune
and in the memory of her lost family.
Give her the picture, Chandragupta.
Go.
Forgive us, Your Highness.
- Forgive us, Your Highness.
- Forgive us, Your Highness!
You need not worry.
I will not punish you.
I will send you to
a place to live surrounded
by lush greenery, animals, and birds.
Enjoy your stay in
that terrible forest!
- No, Your Highness..
- No, Your Highness..
Take them away!
Chandragupta, what should
we do to enhance the security
of our palace?
I need to have a failsafe perimeter.
Lack of soldiers have contributed
to the security breach.
We must recruit and
train more of them.
And should employ security in shifts
to make them more vigilant and rested.
It will help them
be more alert and vigilant.
Great! It is really great!
- Mahamatya.
- Yes?
Announce an increase
in tax in the kingdom.
Sure, Your Majesty.
I have a hunch that
you have a long way to go.
More than I can even imagine.
Even I feel so
Your Majesty.
Even after messing up,
this slave manages
to win the emperor's heart in the end.
Instead of losing his honour,
he is getting more under his grace.
What is your plan, Brother Pandu?
I do not know why I feel there
there is something going
on between the slave and Mura.
I will keep an eye on both of them.
I will then expose
them before the king.
I will use Mura to get
rid of the slave.
Why did you lie?
Do you not know the truth?
Is not this ornament yours?
Am I not your son?
Why did you keep this fact from me?
You cared about me and fed me well.
You took care of me.
You even risked your life for my sake.
'The slave is lying.'
'It is not him,
but me who stole the diamond.'
Did it not occur to you
that it is now time to
tell me that I am your son?
I kept on approaching
you to find the answers
but I failed to know
that you are the
one I was looking for.
If drops of water fall on a hot stove
they evaporate
but if they
fall on lotus
they shine like a pearl in light.
If they fall on a corpse's mouth
it helps attain salvation
to the departed soul.
But if they fall on a snake's mouth
they turn into poison.
The composition of
water is same throughout.
It is only the circumstances
that change.
Surroundings can change
the nature of water
much like humans do.
So, you are advised
to choose the right company
because if you choose a wrong one
either you will face the consequences
or turn into an evil person.
The company we keep
determines our destiny.
The principles are mine.
The choice is yours.
I have gathered you all
here to share some great news.
My slave Chandragupta could not
bring the rare flower for my sister.
And Chandragupta..
He passed away.

================================================================================

Episode: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvQY---ByZk

You got so many chances
but not even for once
did you feel the need
to tell me the truth
that I am your son.
You knew everything, didn't you?
Why did you remain
silent despite that?
Why didn't you tell me the truth?
Chandragupta, I was..
What were you saying?
How..
How can you be so stone-hearted?
Don't you have any
love for me in your heart?
Why are you doing this?
Now that I know everything
and am standing in front of you
and begging to hear it from you..
You are still..
refusing to accept me as your son.
Why?
What! I can't hear
what this slave is saying.
All right! If you really
want to hide your feelings
I will do something
that will compel you
to accept me as your
son and I have decided that.
This is my promise.
What was that slave telling you?
I don't know what
he was talking about.
I didn't pay attention.
Why should I pay any attention?
An ordinary slave
holds no value to me.
Now go away from here.
Let me spend some time
alone with my family.
Chandragupt, my child..
I was surprised
when I received your message
that you wanted to meet me.
I thought, you would have
returned back to Takshashila
after being defeated twice.
Only victories don't
teach you lessons in life.
At times our defeats
teach us big lessons.
After my second defeat
I learned the lesson
that I'd failed to learn
after my first defeat.
So what lesson
did you learn?
It is that Magadh is
the most powerful empire
in this region.
And that the king of Magadh's
supremacy is even more powerful.
After having lost to you twice
I have understood that you are a lot
more powerful and determined than me.
They say, if a person
who makes a mistake realises it
he shouldn't be held guilty.
I am glad that you have
accepted Magadh's supremacy.
But there is something
that you still want to say.
- Am I right?
- You are right.
After having given it
a lot of thought I have decided
it won't be wise for us to
be busy in humiliating each other.
I don't want anyone to take advantage
of the differences between us.
That is why I have called you here.
Now it is time for us
to rise above these petty issues
and look at the bigger
picture so that our friendship
becomes stronger.
If you agree, then..
Our friendship will grow stronger
for sure.
And in the name of this friendship
I would gladly ask you
to enjoy your stay in Magadh.
You may admire the beauty
and wealth of Magadh.
I'll be eagerly waiting
to meet you again, my friend.
Did you see!
This is how you turn
your defeat into victory.
Now wait for how I use
Magadh's power to my advantage
while staying here in Magadh.
Very soon not only Magadh
but also the whole of
India will bow down before me.
If your little game to
exhibit your bravery is over
you may get back the work
that you have been appointed for.
Your duty to guard princess Durdhara.
- Go, get back to work.
- Listen, Bhadrasaal
this is not the right time.
What is it not the right time for?
All right, I am going to the princess.
That slave enjoys taking
up challenges, doesn't he?
Now I will give him
a challenge
that will become the
reason for his downfall.
And he won't be able to refuse it.
What is all this?
Princess, please listen to me..
Until I find someone who can bring
me that flower I won't be at peace.
I want that flower.
But, Princess,
it's impossible for any human.
And if anyone even tries
that person's death is certain.
What is going on, Shipra?
Someone has given the princess
a description of a rare flower
and now she wants that flower.
You..
You are my bodyguard, aren't you?
That means it is also your
responsibility to fulfill all my wishes.
No. That is not my responsibility.
Really?
But it is from now.
This is that rare flower
that has nine colours
whose description I had heard.
And that flower's
place isn't on that tree
it is here in my room.
But, Princess..
This is dangerous.
It will be even more dangerous
if I start hurting
myself for this flower.
I have been told many times
that challenges excite you.
If this is true, you have
to bring that flower for me.
All right.
I will bring that flower.
Go, slave!
Bring me that flower.
This is the rare flower which
blooms for just a month, once a year.
This is one of its kind.
Rare and special, just like me.
Princess..
I think,
it is impossible to bring this.
Why?
He is here.
My brother's favourite
and my bodyguard, Chandragupta
who can do the impossible.
Am I right, Chandragupta?
He ran away.
Tell my brother that he turned
out to be a coward and ran away.
Princess!
There is nothing in this
world that can scare me.
And I will do the impossible
and prove you wrong.
Slave!
He was bragging about
doing the impossible.
Quiet! Shut your mouth and find him.
Shipra, you know that
I did not mean to do this.
I did not want to kill him,
but just teach him a lesson.
You know I did not intend to do this.
- Slave!
- Be calm, Princess.
The soldiers are looking for him.
They will surely bring him alive.
Pardon me, Princess.
The waves are very strong.
Even if he knows to swim,
he cannot survive.
We suspect that he is dead.
Dead?
'I have heard that
you love challenges.'
'If this is the truth,
you must bring me that flower.'
'I will certainly
bring you that flower.'
I have gathered you all
here to share some great news.
My slave Chandragupta
could not bring the
rare flower for my sister
which she demanded to have.
And Chandragupta..
Hail Lord Ram.. Hail Lord Ram!
He passed away.
Well, a slave is born to
serve a king till his last breath.
But I wonder,
why I was so close to him.
He was a great toy.
My source of entertainment.
No..
This is a lie!
This is untrue!
Chandra!
Chandragupta!
Chandra!
Lord..
You took
my last hope away.
You took away my son from me.
He was the only one I survived for.
He was my hope.
You took him away?
I wish I had told you, Chandra..
I wish I had embraced you.
'Why do you keep scolding
me as if you are my mother?'
'Is this not your bangle?
I am your son, right?'
'Then why did you
hide this truth from me?'
I wish..
I wish I could tell you and the world
at the top of my voice
that you are my son.
The Prince of Piplivan
the last heir of the clan of Maurya
Chandragupta Maurya.
'Chandragupta Maurya..'
Mother!
Chandra?
Mother!
You kept
the truth from me for so many years.
Please share it, Mother.
Please, tell me.
I am here
in front of you.
'I believe, this relationship'
'is not just that of slaves.'
'It is something greater..'
'Something deeper!'
The past and future
are like reflections in the mirror.
It appears that you can grab it
but it is always out of your reach.
It deceives us like a reflection does.
While recollecting the
disappointment of the past
or while hoping to have success
in the future which is yet to come
a person fails to
focus on the present.
The present which, if not lived fully
can lead to a disappointing past.
And if the present moment is wasted
it is inevitable for
the future to be destroyed.
Hence, work on your present.
Forget the past.
Stop worrying about the future.
Because if you worry about
the troubles of the future
the future is bound
to have those troubles.
These are my principles.
Make the right choice.
Your mother's dignity and
father's history is still alive.
'I will take revenge of my
father's murder and mother's insult.'
'And Dhananand will
have to repay for his sins.'

Episode: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4IF1Ln1G2Y

You made me tell the truth
by pretending to be dead.
The truth that I was
hiding in my heart.
Yes, I had to pretend, Mother.
But not to make you admit
that you are my mother
but to get the answers
to the questions
which have been
appearing as nightmares
and frightening me.
All these years, I was burning
with animosity and hatred
that I am the only unlucky boy
whose mother
left him alone in this world.
I wish I knew
that the person whom I have
been hating since childhood
is an epitome of love, affection
and sacrifice.
I wish I knew that you needed my love
and not my anger.
I wish I knew
that you needed my help
to get freedom from
Dhananand's wrath.
Why, Mother?
Why did you not tell me the truth?
Why did you keep
me away from yourself?
Why, Mother? Why?
Because it was not important
for you to come with me, Chandra.
It was important for you to live.
If our relationship would
be revealed to the world
Dhananand would not keep you alive.
He would have killed you
just like Veerbhadra.
'Your entire family has
been destroyed completely today.'
'Your husband's last drop
of blood has also been spilt.'
Dhananand wanted to
kill you the same night
when he had attacked Piplivan.
Chandra, even after 12 years
the darkness of that night
disturbs me even today.
I had hidden the truth
from Dhananand for 12 years
that my son is alive.
But..
But he had started
suspecting our relationship.
'The cloth got burnt'
'and the truth is sitting at my feet.'
'Her son is alive.'
'I will bring your
son in front of you.'
'And I will kill your
son in front of you.'
To clear his suspicion
and to save your life
I let Veerbhadra get sacrificed
as per the instructions
of Acharya Chanakya.
If I would come to
you and tell you the truth
you would express all the feelings
that you had hidden within you
all these years in front of Dhananand.
Your life would be in danger.
Veerbhadra's sacrifice
would go in vain
and my meditation of
years would go in vain.
That is why..
That is why I lied to you.
But, Mother
how can the queen of
Piplivan and a brave Kshatrani
become so helpless?
I want to know everything
about my past, Mother.
Tell me, Mother.
From many years
even I was waiting for this moment
to tell you everything
about our past.
12 years ago
our house, our kingdom, Piplivan
was the only kingdom of the Kshatriyas
which could not be
conquered by Dhananand.
Piplivan was not the reason
for the pride of the Kshatriyas
but the cause of worry of Magadha too.
Father, how do you
like my new hairstyle?
I like it a lot.
What do you think?
I made five hairstylists
try different hairstyles
and I liked this hairstyle.
What do you think?
Will Padmanand's son,
Dhananand's hairstyle
leave everyone surprised during
tomorrow's coronation ceremony?
I liked it.
I am happy to see your
love towards your hair
because this hair is
the identity of us 'Napits'.
This is our pride.
But if you want to rise about
your pride and do something in life
this path..
This path will take you there,
Dhananand
where even your father
could not reach.
Piplivan?
Yes, Piplivan.
Dhananand,
before you, your seven brothers
ruled over Magadha for one year each
but they failed in establishing
their rule over Piplivan.
This is the only kingdom
which has become
an obstacle in my path
due to which the dominance,
and pride of the Kshatriyas
is greater than us even now.
Dhananand,
if you conquer this Kshatriya kingdom
you will become a king
of the 'Napit' dynasty
whose example will be given for ages.
Dhananand, I promise you
that your victory
will make you the
king of Magadha forever.
Otherwise, I will be forced
to distributed my kingdom
to all the seven brothers.
It is left to you now.
Will you become the
alone king of Magadha
or will you settle for
one portion of the kingdom?
Father
what is the difficulty
in defeating such a tiny kingdom?
No, Dhananand.
Never make the mistake of judging
an enemy y the size of the kingdom.
You have to remember
that Piplivan Kingdom
has never been defeated.
That is not a palace.
It is a fort.
And it is impossible
to destroy that fort.
It was so strong hat it took
generations of many kings to break it.
But they did not succeed.
Mother, I had realised
it the moment I saw it
that it is not easy to
destroy the fort of Piplivan.
Yes, Chandra.
It was built in such a way
so that nobody can destroy it.
To protect the major
portion of Piplivan's palace
there was a series of walls
which was guided by our
loyal and strong warriors
in the presence of strong archers.
Alertness, carefulness and honesty.
Always remember this principle.
As long as Matsaldev
is alive in Piplivan
let alone the enemies even
the birds cannot move their feathers.
Okay, Matsaldev.
Many attackers came
and many wars took place.
But nobody could destroy
Matsaldev and Piplivan.
And that is not the end.
A special chemical was
mixed in the soil of the fort.
That chemical would burn the moment
it would come in contact with fire.
Whenever the enemies stepped on it
that soil burned the enemies
by turning into fire.
Enough.
I will not hear more
stories about Piplivan.
Dhananand's coronation
ceremony has taken place.
Now, Dhananand will write
the new history of Piplivan.
I want a solution for
those soldiers and those walls.
Piplivan will be lost
in the pages of time
and the stones there will
contain only the seal of Magadha.
There must be some option
by which I can capture Piplivan.
What is that option?
I want to win at any cost.
Getting victory is impossible.
If at all you capture
Turup by any means
then Piplivan will be
snatched back from you again.
Snatch? Will they snatch
my happiness from me?
Impossible!
I will snatch their pride, their power
and the dignity of
their warriors from them!
By destroying Piplivan, I will become
the supreme king..
I beg your pardon, Your Highness.
But the destiny has chosen someone
else for becoming the supreme king.
Around four years ago
I forecasted the future
of newly born prince.
His fate was to be invincible.
No enemy can defeat him
He will become the supreme
king who will bring India together.
But there is a way, Your Highness.
If that prince is
killed at a younger age
then your path of becoming
the supreme king will become easier.
- Otherwise..
- Otherwise?
Otherwise, that prince
will grow up and will kill you.
Priest, who is that prince
will become the reason
of my death in future?
I do not know his name.
But I know that..
That he is no one else,
but the prince of Piplivan.
Fate.. Destiny..
I really loved this
wonderful game of destiny.
The prince of the same
kingdom which I want to capture
will become the reason
of my death in future.
Now, I will have to kill that little
prince to become the supreme king.
However, it is sad,
but I do not like to lose.
And it is important for me
to do this to defeat the destiny.
By the way, there is one more
important work which is pending.
- Do you know what it is, priest?
- What, Your Highness?
Unlucky words should not come
out of your unlucky mouth!
Hail Lord.
The destiny has been shut up.
Snake!
Now, want to meet
the prince of Piplivan.
I am Chandragupta Maurya!
The prince of Piplivan!
Stop! Whoever will challenge
my people or my family
will have to face me!
Ouch! Chandragupta, my leg!
What happened to your leg, father?
Dear Chandragupta. Come here.
Commander Masaldev,
this warrior surrendered his sword.
You should be scolding Chandragupta.
Pardon me, King. I am indebted.
Your Highness and the Queen
has accepted me as family.
I cannot scold this innocent prince.
I will not be able to scold him.
Chandragupta,
nothing has happened to my feet.
This was your test. And look..
You failed.
So many times I have
explained you, Son..
When the enemy is confronting you
then your focus is to gain victory
and not get carried away.
- Only then, victory will be yours.
- But Father
along being brave a warrior
should also have empathy.
Without empathy,
a warrior will then become a killer.
Mother has taught me this.
Very nice, Chandragupta.
I am very much delighted
that you remember my teachings.
Mura.
You should not be teaching
this to Chandragupta.
Day and night I am trying
to make him a valiant warrior
but you are making him a
sympathiser and a soft-hearted boy.
No, My Lord.
What our son just told you
is the true identity of a warrior.
Mura!
This is not about identity.
We are been surrounded
by enemy kingdoms.
I am preparing Chandragupta
for the hard times to come
where he has to face
the dreadedness of the future.
For the great king Piplivan..
I, King of Magadha
heartily greet you!
Dhananand had come
as a messenger of peace
and was on his knees
with folded hands.
In front of the King of Piplivan
he had begged for his friendship.
Seven of my brothers
had attacked you continuously
but every time they were
unsuccessful in front of your might.
I believe in learning
from others' mistakes.
So I have come to your humble
abode to extend my friendship.
I hope the enmity and hatred
between us will come to an end.
That is why,
I have brought a gift for you.
'If the prince is killed in his teens'
'then your dream of becoming
the emperor will come true.'
'Or else, after he becomes mature,
he will be your death.'
By adding drops of lemon to the milk
the milk becomes sour.
But in that same
milk if we add jaggery
the milk does not become sour.
The same way
before giving a space to a person
in our lives or before
getting acquainted
we should very well know his behaviour
his motive and nature.
That's because you are not
water which can mix everything.
So stay alert
because ignorance
will make you pay a price
the way milk suffers
when added with juices of lemon.
I depart the words of wisdom..
And the outcome is in your hands.
Now there will be blood of Dhananand!
I am no longer your
slave but I am your death
and I will make you pay
for the murder of my father!
Chandra..

================================================================================

Episode: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8w_Emnf9rSU

I am certain
that would be most pleased to see
this statue of Lord Ardhnaarishwar.
A war is not limited
to just two rulers
but a war is between two nations.
And the pain flows to all the people.
Neither the others get any joy
from it nor does one get any peace.
And hence I am here
to end this bloodshed.
I respect your proposal, Dhananand.
But you could have sent
this proposal with an envoy.
Certainly, I could have
but that would be an insult
to a great king like you.
And hence I came here alone, unarmed
as I know that a true warrior king
will never attack an unarmed man.
I can understand
that you need time to think over it.
And hence I ask your leave.
- Commander Matsaldev.
- Yes.
Please bring this gift in the palace.
As you command, Sire.
Beloved. Is it right to
accept a gift from Dhananand?
You are from a warrior clan.
Even if the enemy attacks at any time
we are ready to face them in battle.
Even so, beloved.
We must strengthen our guard.
Dhananand is a snake
that can strike at any time.
- Charge!
- Charge!
The gongs of war! At this hour?
Dhananand!
You came here seeking
a treaty of peace!
No, Chandravardhan!
I seek war!
And so unfolded the events
that changed the history of Piplivan.
Blemished the honour
and pride of warrior clans.
And me..
You were taken from me.
Commander, take the Queen
and the Prince to safety.
- Go!
- No, my Lord.
I cannot leave you
here alone in this danger.
And you had just said
that a warrior is always
ready to face enemy.
And it is my duty to stay beside
you like an immovable mountain!
I will fulfill my duty.
No!
This is my command, Mura.
It is your duty to guard
the future of Piplivan.
Go!
Prepare Chandra.
If I were to fall
then he will have
to regain his kingdom.
- My Lord.
- He must avenge his father's death.
And he will do so.
Leave!
Kill them all!
Kill every warrior you find!
Kill their pride and honour!
And show them!
The valour of this barber Nand!
Bring that prince!
Where is that prince?
Commander!
I will not come with you.
I will stay and fight.
You must leave and
take my son with you.
Take him to my brother at once.
Mother!
I do not want to leave you.
Commander, take him!
Mother, I do not
want to leave! Mother!
I am proud!
That I am the son of a mother
who suffered greatly
herself to send her son away
so that she can fight as a warrior
to protect her people and her kingdom.
Stop, king Chandravardhan.
Otherwise your dear
wife will lose her life.
No dear, you will not surrender.
And not for this cruel king.
No.
Why, my Lord?
You had taught me
that a true warrior is sensitive
and merciful.
Hail Lord Dhananand!
Hail Lord Dhananand!
Hail Lord Dhananand!
Hail Lord Dhananand!
Just the King and the Queen?
Where is that Prince, Councillor?
Forgive me, my Lord.
I could not find
that lordling anywhere.
I believe he has been
sent to a secret safekeep.
But rest assured, my Lord.
My spies will find him at once.
I did not win this throne only
to have my enemy escape my reach!
I want that princeling.
It is true what I had heard of you.
Nanda, a lowborn.
You are no king, Plunderer!
You are not worthy to be called a man.
You wish to kill an infant!
Chandravardhan!
Chandravardhan!
Such an eagerness to
establish your bravery?
Set me free from these binds
and I will show you
what a warrior is, lowborn!
A challenge?
I accept.
Tomorrow at dawn,
we will fight in the woods of Piplivan
and your Queen
your wife..
She will see her husband
die right in front of her.
Guards, take them away.
Come, Mura.
My Lord, let me tell you.
There is no warrior
who can best Chandravardhan in combat.
Till now, Councillor.
But from tomorrow onwards
there will be only one great warrior!
Dhananand!
Splendid!
I could have killed you yesterday,
Chandravardhan
but I did not want to lose to the joy
of killing a king in front
of his people and his wife
by his very sword!
Rise!
This is an arena and
not a barber's stall.
Not words but weapons must speak,
lowborn.
This duel is between
a warrior and a lowborn Nand.
This duel is between
a warrior and a lowborn Nand.
No one else will meddle.
Now you will lose even if you kill me.
Since your hope is lost.
My men have killed
your son!
The prince of Piplivan is dead!
No!
'Chandravardhan has
spewed his venom against me'
'and this very venom'
'will kill him!'
The venomous hatred
that you spat at me
yesterday in your court!
I have smeared the sword
in it and given it back to you!
One more thing!
Your son is not dead yet.
He still lives
but now that you are about to die
it will not take me long
to end his life
and soon you will meet your son.
But not here!
Dear God!
You will see him in afterlife!
My Lord!
My Lord!
- Hail Lord Dhananand!
- Hail!
- Hail Lord Dhananand!
- Hail!
Hail Lord Dhananand!
My Lord!
My Lord!
Hail Lord Dhananand!
Hail Lord Dhananand!
Hail Lord Dhananand!
Kill me!
Kill me, Nand!
You want me to kill you?
Not at all.
You are the mark
of this victory of mine
which seemed ever elusive!
I will not kill you.
Rather I will bound you
as a maiden to serve me.
So every time I trample
your pride under my feet
the people will remember this day
and my victory over warriors!
- Hail Lord Dhananand!
- Hail!
- Hail Lord Dhananand!
- Hail!
- Hail Lord Dhananand!
- Hail!
- Hail Lord Dhananand!
- Hail!
- Hail Lord Dhananand!
- Hail!
Hail Lord Dhananand!
You have to avenge
your father's death!
your father's death,
mine and of Piplivan.
I understand your feelings for which
you have given this
bracelet back to me.
But Dhananand knows
how crucial this bracelet is for you.
If he sees this in my hand
he will know of our bond.
So it will be better
if you keep it with you.
No more tears, Mother.
Now there will be blood of Dhananand!
I will go to him right
now and I will have my revenge.
For every torment
and pain
that he has inflicted upon you!
Dhananand!
I am no longer your slave
but I am your death!
I will avenge the pain
that my mother suffered
and I will make you pay
for the murder of my father!
Do you see this pearl?
The oyster that houses it..
It was once a living being.
But it made a mistake
and it was to allow
a small particle of sand within.
And after entering within
that sand particle
drew upon the juices
within the oyster
and in time, gradually
that oyster died
and came forth a pearl.
Just as that particle of sand
an enemy may be weak or frail
but if given a chance,
it can be deadly!
So always keep an eye on your enemies
and do not let them venture too close
or else you will lose your existence.
A lesson from me
and an action from you.
Chandra!
They have taken my Chandra.
This is happening as per my orders.
Because be it blood or milk
if it boils before time
it causes self-destruction
and I will not let
Chandragupta destroyed himself

================================================================================

Episode: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yTeOK12tkKM

Stop, Chandra.
You are not ready to fight Dhananand.
You are still a child.
But, Mother,
he is my father's murderer.
I am sorry
because if I stop now
your tears will also not stop.
And I do not want that to happen.
Stop, Chandra. Do not go.
Chandra, stop.
Mother, it is better
if nobody spots you with me.
Come with me.
Leave me. Where are you taking me?
- Leave me.
- Chandra!
Chandra!
Chandra!
Chandra..
Acharya, they have taken my Chandra.
I know.
This is happening as per my orders.
What!
- Your orders?
- Yes.
Because be it blood or milk
if it boils before time
it causes self-destruction
and I will not let
Chandragupta destroyed himself
because his anger and his temper
is for killing Dhananand
and not for destroying himself.
Chandragupta has become
a slave from a prince.
And after finding out
the truth about his past
his inner soul has been hurt.
Now, Chandragupta
is like an injured lion
which will definitely prove
to be deadly for some time.
But due to his injury
he will become an
easy prey at the end.
I will give Chandragupta
the armour of education.
I will give him the
shield of training.
I will make his anger his
weapon and not his weakness.
Chandragupta is not capable
enough to face Dhananand now.
Even you are not unaware
about this truth.
Dhananand is cruel. He is cunning.
But he is not a fool.
He will realise the fire of revenge
burning in Chandragupta's
eyes from a distance.
I will give a direction
to this fire of revenge
that is burning in
Chandragupta's heart.
I will teach him how
to control his anger.
I will make him a man from a boy.
The day I believe completely
that Chandragupta has become
capable of finishing Dhananand
I will send him to Magadha on my own.
You return to Pataliputra till then
and wait for the arrival of
the future king of the united India.
"Chanakya.."
This is Vishnugupta Acharya's promise
to a mother and to this motherland
that Chandragupta Maurya
will be the lone king of India.
'If anything happens to me'
'he will have to
reconquer our kingdom.'
'He will have to return
to take his father's revenge.'
The future that you
had announced before leaving
has arrived now, dear.
You had announced
that our son will take our revenge
and the revenge for every torture
that Piplivan had to go through.
That time has arrived now.
Chandra has found out who he is.
The entire world will
find out this truth soon
through his bravery
that the son of the
great Chandravardhan
and the pride of the Mauryas
and the revenge of Piplivan
and Dhananand's death is our son.
Chandragupta Maurya is
the future king of united India.
Who is it?
Who goes there?
Chandragupta?
No! Bring in the mirror!
Is my nose okay?
Is it in its position?
Don't be silent!
Is my nose in its position?
Yes, Your Highness.
Your nose is intact.
'That was a strange dream.'
A-Acharya..
Please solve a problem.
Do you want to make
Chandragupta the emperor
or a man suffering from cold?
Forgive me, Chandra.
Throw more water on him!
Maybe the cold water
will calm down his burning rage.
Not only this water..
Even the entire snow of the Himalayas
will not be able to calm
down the fire of vengeance, Acharya!
This rage will only die
down with Dhananand's blood!
Acharya, even you wanted
me to kill Dhananand.
Then why are you stopping me?
Release me, Acharya.
My duty is beckoning me!
Let me go, Acharya!
If you can control your anger within
then nothing will
be helpful than that.
But if anger controls
you and keeps you burning
then no enemy is greater than that.
When you will learn
to control your rage..
Try to live with it..
When you'll learn to
use it as your weapon..
The time when I will be convinced
that you are capable of attacking
and also able to bear injuries..
Then you will definitely
get the opportunity
to have your vengeance on Dhananand.
You all are the most intellectual
and knowledgeable persons of Magadh.
Tell me, what can be the
meaning of the dream I had?
Forgive me, Emperor. After all,
a dream is nothing more than its name.
It is not necessary
to get impatient by it.
And the slave who has already died
cannot come alive if
he comes in your dream.
This was a common dream
which the king of Magadh
- should not be worried about.
- Illusion..
Maybe illusion, monk.
During the same time, I had a dream
that I will become
the emperor of Magadh!
And that dream came true.
And I saw this dream at the same time.
And you say that
I should not be bothered!
Are you assuming my
impatience as my weakness..
That I got scared by a dream?
Not at all, Emperor.
I wanted to say that it
was only a dream and not a reality.
Very good!
Brilliant!
With this view point,
all the troubles will be warded off.
Whenever there is trouble in life
one should ignore it
as a bad dream, right..
- Monk?
- N-No. No.
Right.
What happened? Is it paining?
Good Lord!
Consider this to be a dream.
Think that this never happened.
Nor there will be pain
nor any worries.
Mahamatya.
Again these monks
have disappointed me.
In your bastion, is there
no other monk in the entire Magadh
who can answer the
reason for my impatience?
Tell me, Mahamatya.. What should I do?
I have definitely
read in the scriptures
that at a certain time when there
are nightmares there is an antidote.
The dreamer should sneeze, Emperor.
And that too
before the sunrise..
At the crack of dawn.
The sun is heading towards Magadh,
Mahamatya!
Why is everybody standing here?
Find a way out.. Do something..
Make sure that
I sneeze before sunrise!
This is your first task.
You have to strike
on water with your hands.
But remember
that not a single drop
of water should spill.
What difference will that make?
You will get the answer once
you successfully complete the task.
The sooner you complete my task
the sooner you will be free,
Chandragupta.
What is the meaning of this task?
Only Acharya will be
able to tell the reason.
Stop!
This time if you are successful
then it is fine
or else I'll have to tie your hands.
And then, after a few days,
we will try this task again.
Incredible!
Your efficiency
increases under pressure.
My job has been accomplished,
Chandragupta.
And my objective as well.
I wanted you to realise
that if we use our power at
the right moment and in right quantity
then it becomes easier
to achieve success.
When you were using your
power in an uncontrolled manner
the pitcher got broken
and the water spilled
out of the pitcher.
But when you concentrated
and controlled your anger
and hit the water
neither did the pitcher break
nor did the water spill over.
Only waves were generated.
You need to generate the same waves
among the people of Magadh in future.
And these waves will
come in handy
to end Dhananand's cruel regime.
Take this away.
I don't feel like sneezing,
Amatya Rakshas.
The sun is about to rise.
What do you think?
Will my nightmare come true?
Nothing will happen to you,
Your Highness.
I will not let anything happen to you.
'The sun is about to rise.'
'And there is no one here
who can help the emperor sneeze.'
Congratulations! The emperor sneezed.
- You!
- Yes, it's me.
You might have forgotten
what early morning nightmares
and sneezing in the morning indicate.
It indicates that the emperor
will face several problems
- and crisis in future.
- Mura!
Before I behead you
get out of here.
Amatya, look at him.
Look at him.
He knows that I am speaking the truth.
Your Highness,
do not worry after hearing her words.
She just wants to torture
you mentally. That is it!
No..
Amatya Rakshas
I can sense
that my bad time is not over yet.
I feel as if a large snake
is heading towards me
gradually out of the darkness
to bite me.
If you want me to get killed
then there are better options
available in this world.
Listen to me carefully.
As long as you will look in its eyes
it will not bite you.
Follow its behaviour.
Move your head with it.
And it will follow your actions
and behaviour gradually.
Even Dhananand is like
a large poisonous snake
who is crawling in this world
in the form of a human being.
You need to do the same to him.
First, follow him.
Later, he will follow you.
'You have to take revenge
on behalf of your father'
'me and Piplivan.'
What are you doing?
This snake could have bitten you too.
I am dying every day.
The desire of taking revenge
is burning in my heart.
Chandragupta, you have
failed to learn today's lesson.
And as a punishment
you need to spend the
rest of the day in this forest.
Remember one thing, Chandragupta.
If you are able to control
your anger and learn this lesson
then no snake will be able
to bite you in your old age
no matter if it is a snake
who moves in this jungle
or if it is Dhananand
who is the emperor of Magadh.
It is a Rudraksha. It is considered
the tears of Lord Mahadev.
If there are tears in your eyes,
wipe the tears on your own.
Because if you let
someone to wipe your tears
he will use you.
First, he will show you sympathy.
And he will take a
lot from you in return.
That is why, do not express
your weakness by shedding tears.
Do not let anyone learn about this.
Improve yourself in private.
And transform your weakness
into your strength.
Like Lord Mahadev's Rudraksha
transform your tears
into something useful.
Remember this.
If you show your weakness to others
it will mark the first
step of your failure.
Follow my principles
and make your own fate.
Should I keep the person
who killed my father alive?
He kept my mother as
a slave for many years.
Dhananand, I am coming as your death.

Acharya, as per your instructions
I have brought him
to the hermitage again.
- Is he all right?
- Yes.
But, Acharya, you left him
alone amidst the poisonous serpents.
What if he would die?
Bhairav, I have prayed day
and night for Chandragupta's life.
But the problem is
Chandragupta himself does
not know the value of his life.
He becomes eager to risk his
life when he is instigated slightly.
I want him to realise
how precious his life is.
And you sent him towards
death after that.
Acharya, you are crossing
all the limits of strictness.
But he is still very
stern and furious.
I do not think he will break.
If it was so easy
to break Chandragupta
or if he was not so stubborn
I would never select him.
If Chandragupta wants to become
the king of a united India in future
he will have to be equally stubborn
like his Acharya who is
dreaming about a united India.
Chandra, it is lunch time.
Have something.
Why are you being so stubborn?
And why are you venting
out your anger on the food?
Stulbhadra, which was your
favourite toy during your childhood?
The spinning top.
Tell me, what had happened with it?
Lubdhak had snatched
it and thrown it into a ditch
because he thought Stulbhadra
will not concentrate on his work
if he plays with it.
What had happened after that?
And I did not eat for three days.
I liked my spinning top a lot.
I was very sad.
Then?
And you jumped into that ditch
and you fought with every obstacle
and brought it back, Chandra.
You were so sad and restless
after losing your
favourite toy as a kid
that you did not eat for three days.
And I..
Dhananand took away my childhood.
My identity.
Mother's love, father's blessings.
Everything!
Is my anger not justified?
Every drop of blood
flowing in my veins
is grateful to my mother's
sacrifice and loss.
Will that blood not boil
when I see the person
who kept me away from
my mother for 12 years?
He ruined my mother's pride
respect and honour everyday
in front of his ego.
I was burning in fire so far
to know about my identity
and to find out who I am.
When I have found out who I am today
who my parents are
and who is responsible
for this injustice towards us
I am tied up here.
Is it not my duty
to give freedom to
my mother from Dhananand?
Should I not take
revenge from Dhananand
for my father's murder and
the destruction of my kingdom?
Answer me.
But how does this make
a difference to all of you?
Because all of you
are not my friends anymore
who were ready to die for me.
Dhananand!
"Chandragupta. Chandragupta."
"He is a warrior. Chandragupta."
"His sight is as sharp as a blade.
Chandragupta."
Your anger is justified, Acharya.
But Chandra is also important for us.
There cannot be a better
friend than him, Acharya.
Yes, Acharya.
He has always considered
our problems as his.
Acharya, he always thinks
from his heart for us
and not from his mind.
So, why should we not
think from our heart for him?
That is why we freed him.
A sensitive prince
who thinks from the heart
and not the mind.
How did I make such a big mistake?
Friends, thank you
for enlightening me about my mistake.
Dhananand,
I am coming to you as your death.
I have done everything
as per your instructions.
But not today.
I am going to kill King Dhananand.
And you.. You will not stop me.
I will not stop you either,
Chandragupta.
But I want to show you
something before you leave.
No plan of yours will work, Brahmin.
You have held me captive
like this earlier too.
Chandragupta,
if I had to hold you captive
I would have done it by now.
I would not be standing in
front of you and talking to you.
So, trust me once and come with me.
Why have you called me here, Brother?
You know how precious you are to me.
I have not been able to sleep
peacefully from the past few days
and your safety was
the reason behind it.
There is some problem around me.
And I want to keep you
safe from every problem.
Your bodyguard,
Chandragupta, is no more.
So, I have decided
to recruit his replacement.
I went against your wish
to recruit Chandragupta last time.
So, I will let you choose
one this time.
Let the candidates be presented.
He is top notch marksman
of Kaushal Kingdom
whose arrows can hit
any flying bird's eyes.
Great. Do you like it, Sister?
He hails from Gandhar Kingdom
who is the fastest thrower
of spear in the world.
His accuracy is up
to a distance of 400 Hands.
Incredible!
I hope you liked him. Am I right?
Princess
they are Amravati's best wrestler.
They're powerful enough
to lift an elephant's cub.
So tell me
who did you like?
None.
But.. Your safety..
Are you not the ruler
of this kingdom, Brother?
Who knows more about
security than you?
You may do whatever you want to.
You do not need my permission.
Yes, Durdhara.
Of course I am a ruler.
A cruel, powerful and imposing one!
But for you
I am your brother.
Nothing is as important
to me than seeing you smile.
I smiled for you. Are you happy now?
Amatya, she is dealing
with some issue for sure.
She is not happy.
She is not smiling.
Announce throughout the kingdom
that whoever can make her smile
I will reward him.
Sure.
Pay me alms..
Pay me alms..
Pay me alms..
Give me alms.
Give me alms.
Give me alms.
Acharya, why are we
sitting outside the kingdom
where I was advised not to go?
We are here for that beggar.
Why are we here for him?
How is he related to Dhananand and me?
You will find your answer
if you keep mum for a while.
Why is he bowing
in front of the palace?
Why is he paying homage to it?
Keep an eye on him.
You will get your answers.
We must follow him.
What is his motive?
Let's ask him.
- What?
- Follow me.
What are you doing?
Will you tell us
or should I call guards?
Why just guards? Call Dhananand!
Tell him, I do not fear him.
I await a revolutionary.
I wait for the ray of hope
who will bring our lost honour back.
I await the Prince of Piplivan.
I am accumulating this
money to build an army.
An army that will help
the Prince of Piplivan
in destroying Dhananand.
You are a beggar, asking for alms.
You speak of defeating
Dhananand but you were begging
- outside his palace!
- Yes, I am a beggar.
I ask for alms.
I do it in front of the palace
but the reason is not Dhananand
but the Queen of Piplivan
who lives in the palace.
I praise her, I worship her.
I would do that even 12 years ago.
Yes, I am a beggar
but I was once the
commander-in-chief of Piplivan.
'Commander-in-chief,
this warrior surrendered his weapon.'
'You should be scolding Chandragupta.'
'Pardon me, Your Majesty.'
'You and the Queen have
always considered me family'
'but I cannot scold
this young prince.'
Commander-in-chief Matsaldev?
Former Sire, the dead never return.
The prince you wait for
is killed by Dhananand.
He was murdered.
- Nobody will come to your rescue.
- He is alive.
I.. I had taken the prince away
from the Queen with my very own hands.
I handed him to his uncle.
'Commander-in-chief,
please take my son with you.'
'Take him to my brother. Immediately!'
When Dhananand left our King to die
I was the one who brought
his corpse here.
This is no ordinary tomb.
This is the tomb of the one
who was the pride of Kshatriyas
Chandravardhan Maurya.
And I collect coins here
so that his soul can witness
that the war for the independence
of Piplivan is yet to begin.
Dhananand tortured me.
He gauged one of my eyes.
He severed my legs. Yet I did
not tell him that the Prince is alive.
I just said that he was dead
so that he would stop looking for him.
But I am certain that
the Prince will return
with strength equal to mine
and that of the people of Pippalivana.
Prince must return to exact revenge
for his parents and his motherland.
'If something happens to me,
he must win our land back.'
'He must return to
avenge his father's death.'
"O' Chandragupta Maurya!"
"O' Chandragupta Maurya!"
"O' Chandragupta Maurya!"
"O' Chandragupta Maurya!"
Your dreams and hopes..
Your faith has won,
Commander-in-chief Matsaldev.
What! What did you call me?
Come closer!
'Stop! The ones who
try to challenge my family'
'and loved ones, must fight me first.'
You are not mistaken,
Commander-in-chief.
The Prince you waited for..
He is the one. Chandragupta Maurya!
I will not let your
sacrifices go in vain.
I will exact revenge
for everything Dhananand
did to you and even for the things
he did to the people
of Piplivan.
- This is my promise to you.
- Your Highness..
"O' Chandragupta Maurya!
Chandragupta Maurya!"
Sensitive prince.
"Chandragupta Maurya!"
The sweet water of many
rivers merges into the ocean.
Yet the water of
the ocean tastes salty.
Because that is the
nature of the ocean.
Similarly, no matter how well
you behave with a cunning person
expecting him to go against
his instinctive nature
to do something nice, is futile.
And hence
one must make attempts on people
whom one can expect from, to deliver.
These are my principles.
The choice is yours.
I hate Chandragupta.
Accept that you are missing him.
That is why you did not
like any of the bodyguards
that the emperor showed to you.

================================================================================

Episode: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V16lQ5uxjys

Acharya, I am ready to follow
your direction and take your guidance.
But let me clear one thing.
Never get this feeling
that I am just a puppet
and that, you can control my actions.
Remember this.
This is my battle. My revenge..
I am doing this for my father, mother
commander Matsal Dev and
for all the people of Piplivan.
You just need to guide me.
I will decide my own path.
Okay.
I accept this for now.
So that means
you will not stop me now.
Because, I am going
to enter the palace.
You can, for sure.
But not as a prince
who wants to take revenge.
You will go there as a servant
who has returned after
defeating his death
to win everyone's heart.
Why am I feeling that you
are going to tell me a story now?
Your feeling is right.
This story is about that
thorn which had pierced my foot.
'I have heard that
you love challenges.'
'If that is actually true, you will
have to bring that flower for me.'
'I will bring it for you at any cost.'
Chandragupta.
Chandragupta.
Look at your face!
It has turned radiant.
I even saw a mild smile on your face.
What rubbish!
Oh! Listen to me.
I was doubtful about it before.
But after seeing your expression
I have realised as to why
you were sad for all these days.
Stop your nonsense!
Look, I hate Chandragupta.
In fact,
I am happy that I got rid of him.
Durdhara, accept it now.
Accept that you are missing him.
That is why you did not like
any of the bodyguards
that the emperor showed to you.
Move!
Are you still thinking
about the sign behind that dream?
Forget it, Dhananand.
You are talented and powerful.
Nothing can happen to you.
How did the weather
change all of a sudden?
"Chandragupta Maurya!"
'I did not cut the tree
whose thorn had pierced my foot.'
'I just dug near its roots
and placed 'Mattha' in it.'
'That attracted a lot of ants'
'that feasted on its roots'
'and destroyed the tree's existence.'
'That is what you
must do with Dhananand.'
'You must make him powerless.'
'For that, you first need to gauge'
'Dhananand's power and capability.'
'And then,
you should know his empire well.'
'I understood it, Acharya.'
'I will make him powerless
while being right under his nose.'
'Slowly'
'I will destroy'
'his support system.'
'And then, I will put an
end to the sins of Dhananand.'
"Chandragupt Maurya.."
"Chandragupt Maurya.."
"Chandragupt Maurya.."
My dear servant, you are back?
Minister, my favourite one is back.
Welcome back!
'Mura, the prince
of Piplivan is here.'
'He must be tired.'
'Wash his feet.'
"Chandragupta."
"Chandragupta."
'He will have to return
to take his father's revenge.'
'And he will take
his father's revenge.'
"Chandragupta Maurya. Chandragupta."
'You have to take the
revenge for your father'
'me and Piplivan.'
I do not know why I was sure
that you cannot die.
God has given you a gift, Your Majesty
that you can see the reality
from a true perspective.
Why are you standing away?
Come, give me a hug.
'This is what I have to do.'
'I have to take you to
the highest level of self-praise'
'because the higher you climb'
'the further you will
go away from your roots'
'and then I will stay in
your shelter and destroy you.'
'Chandragupta Maurya is your death,
Dhananand'
'who has returned with a promise'
'of his father's blood,
his mother's tears'
'the sacrifice of my army
and Commander Matsal Dev's trust'
'that I will destroy
you and your kingdom.'
Amazing.
You are really amazing, slave.
Despite falling from such a great
height you did not just return alive
but there is no scratch on your body.
Sometimes, I think your life
is an embodiment of miracle.
But there is one problem.
Do you know what?
I do not believe in miracles.
I believe in logic.
Tell me.
If you were alive,
why did you take so long to return?
The fire that I am
seeing in your eyes today
was never seen before this.
Something is different.
Something is definitely
new in your personality.
What are you hiding?
Tell me.
Why did you not return?
I will definitely answer
your question, Your Majesty.
But in front of Princess Durdhara.
I could return earlier itself.
But Princess Durdhara
had ordered me to bring
that rare purple coloured flower.
When I fell down from that waterfall
I went with the current for a long
distance while following that flower.
But I did not stop
following that flower.
Today
I have brought that same flower.
This flower..
Brother.
Amatya.
Amatya, my sister is smiling.
Yes. Yes, Your Majesty.
Yes, Brother. I am smiling.
According to your announcement
we should reward him.
Ask, slave. Ask for whatever you want.
Sure. Ask for what you want.
I cannot disrespect
the king's order and
the princess's generosity.
So, I will definitely
ask you for something.
But not for myself.
I have had three close friends
ever since I became a slave.
And they are not just my friends
but like my family, Your Majesty.
So, I would be grateful to you
if you would give them a job
like you gave me under your shelter.
Definitely!
Now that my dearest
sister has said this
a brother
and a king cannot
go against her orders.
Definitely.
We already had that
slave Chandragupta with us
and now three more like
him will be joining us.
The time is not far
when we will have to pack
our bags and leave from here.
Just as that one slave
is bringing three more like him
those three will bring two each.
And those nine people
will bring 90 people.
And they will spread like termites
in every room of the palace
and they will oust us from this palace.
You are worrying unnecessarily.
Nothing as such will happen.
We have to stop the three of them
from getting any work in the palace.
Neither will we have three slaves
nor will 300 people come here.
Palace! This means,
I will get tasty food.
No. Royal food.
This means,
we will walk on silk carpets.
We will sleep on soft mattresses.
This means,
we will get to see beautiful maids
every day.
This means
the first step of
my plan is successful.
All that is fine, Acharya.
You have not told us
about your actual plan yet.
Why have you asked me to
get them a job in the palace?
They will work as Dhananand's
servants in the palace.
They will be your eyes and ears.
They will inform you about
all the activities inside the palace.
All four of you are
important pillars of my plan.
And Chandragupta will lead your group.
But what is this plan?
Tonight is a full moon night.
Exactly after one month
from today on a full moon night
the first trumpet of our battle
against Dhananand will be sounded.
Under Chandragupta's
leadership our army
will destroy this darkness that has
been spread by Dhananand's cruel rule
and we will lay the first foundation
of the united India's bright future.
What?
Army?
Our army?
But how is this possible?
We do not have the facilities
to set up an army, Acharya.
We are not ready for a small fight
and you want us to
fight without weapons
against the vast army of Magadh.
Wow!
If the fire is lit in your heart
even a small flame will be sufficient
to burn the entire jungle,
Chandragupta.
You do not need weapons to fight a war
but you need determination
in your heart.
As far as facilities are concerned
the king of Magadh, Dhananand
will provide these facilities to us.
Dhananand's biggest
strength is his wealth
and that is his biggest weakness too.
And we will attack
his weakness ruthlessly.
This will be the first
step of our revolution.
Stealing Dhananand's wealth.
Most of the birds and
animals that live in the jungle
hunt for their survival.
They succeed sometimes.
They fail sometimes.
But there is one attacker
whose attack never goes in vain.
A hawk!
And a hawk always succeeds
because it has a plan behind
every attack.
It does not attack the
prey the moment it spots it.
It just observes the prey.
It roams around its
prey for hours and days
from a great height so much so
that the prey does not even
realise that it's being watched.
And when the right time arrives
just one attack
and the prey dies.
So, if you want to succeed in life
make a plan bravely
and when the right time arrives
attack the target
with all your strength.
The teachings are mine
and the destiny is yours.
Make the enemy's weakness
your biggest strength.
Deprive him of his wealth
and make him a pauper.

================================================================================

Episode: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXE430_ghuI

If you carry the flame in your heart
then even a small spark is
able to burn down a forest to ashes.
One does not simply need
a weapon in hand to fight a war
but one needs to be
determined to the cause.
Dhananand's greatest
might is his wealth
and that very wealth is his weakness.
And we will strike mercilessly
on this very weakness.
This will be the first
chapter of this revolt of ours.
To plunder the wealth of Dhananand.
Councillor,
look at these empty chests..
Tomorrow, they will be
filled with gold to the brim.
Right when the terrified
subjects of Magadh
will pay their taxes
for their existence!
And all that gold will
be filled in these chests
and my joy will grow times fold!
My Lord, may the Gods bless Magadh
with abundance and boundless prosperity.
The wealth of Magadh is mine.
Truly said, Sire.
Emperor Dhananand is Magadh himself.
And Magadh exists because
of Emperor Dhananand.
Agreed, Councillor.
But when it comes to gold..
I think in a different manner.
A little different.
Different than Magadh.
You know it well, Councillor.
Yes, Sire. I know it well.
And hence, I have arranged
to send this loved gold of yours
to the safe place where it belongs.
Someplace that lies in Magadh
but not in the sights of Magadh.
I will be waiting for tomorrow.
As my gold will arrive
and along with it,
there will be the three friends
of that insect of mine.
And you know, Councillor.
I cannot stand incompetence.
Rest assured, Sire.
While I draw breath, no such person
will ever step foot in the palace
that is not dedicated to serve you
be it by will,
by action and by nature.
Acharya, if we enter the palace,
with such thought
then we will be going
to oblivion, Acharya.
I am pleased to know
that you have sensed
the extent of the threat.
You are not going there
as servant of the palace
but you will go there as my soldier.
And for a soldier, his devotion to his
commander values the most above all.
And so does his confidence
in his commander.
Do you see these beads?
All the beads are same
except one which is bigger.
And in all of these, the one
bead stands different.
Not just in appearance
and shape but also in nature.
Since it is poisoned.
If there ever comes
a time when you get caught
or when anyone doubts you
and there is no way
out and no other choice
and Dhananand,
or any other person at the palace
doubts Chandragupta
due to your actions
or even if Chandragupta is in peril
then you must swallow
that bead at once.
In this great revolution
we will have to make sacrifices.
And these beads will serve
you if such events come to pass.
Come, step forth.
This very moment will
stand witness of your decision.
But Acharya..
Silence.
You must decide today
and no one will decide for you.
You must do it yourself.
This is the final chance
for you to step back
from this great revolution.
Since if you jump in
there will be no way out.
Tell me, what do you decide?
We are with you in
this great war, Chandra.
This is not just your war..
It is our cause as well.
Now begins your journey
to adulthood from being children.
It is not just Chandragupta,
but you all.
Tomorrow's dawn will
bring a new chapter
in the revolution against Dhananand.
Commander Bhadrasaal.
These are my three friends
that I mentioned to the Emperor.
These three are skilled
at what they do.
He is Indrajanik.
Nothing gets past his sight.
He can count at a great pace.
He can count the raindrops.
And this lad here.
He is my friend, Dhumketu.
The fastest runner.
The fastest in all of Magadh.
And he is Stulbhadra.
There cannot be a
better cook than him.
And that is not all..
He can taste the preparation and tell
you the ingredients used to make it.
So Stulbhadra can work in the kitchen.
Dhumketu can work as a messenger.
And Indrajanik can
be used as you see fit.
One that requires counting.
Come, friends.
Let me show you where you will work.
Why such a haste?
I admit that my sister
has given you her word
that your friends
can serve at the palace.
But my sister knows well
that I hate incompetence.
So they must be tested.
A test for them and
an amusement for me!
It will be such a joy.
And it will be quite a sight.
And what if they were to fail?
Then what punishment
comes from Emperor Dhananand?
My dear slave.
Now you will blindfold your friend.
And he must not be
able to see anything.
And four dishes will
be served before him.
And he must tell us of the ingredients
used by simply tasting the food.
I carry the names
of the ingredients used.
So I will know if he is right
or wrong.
Go ahead.
The dishes.
One, two.
Three.
Four.
Before you begin the test
I wish to inform you that
one of the vessels
are laced with poison.
Which one of it could be poisoned?
I truly do not know.
But I am quite eager to know.
Nursemaid had suggested this test.
She is the head of the royal kitchen.
Now if you pass this test
you will be allowed
to work in the royal kitchen
and if you were to fail
then you will go in the jaws of death.
Begin the test at once.
I am eager to know
which of these is poisoned?
Is it the first,
the second, the fourth or the third?
Make haste.
My Lord.
This preparation has basil,
curry leaves, black pepper
along with cloves..
And some salt
and honey.
Splendid. Now taste the next one.
Stul!
- Water..
- Stul..
Easy! Have some water!
Are you all right?
He is still alive.
This preparation was very spicy.
Ingredients?
My Lord, it has green chillies,
black pepper
along with garlic,
onions and carrom seeds strongly.
But it powdered chili
is used a lot in this.
The Emperor would be at unease,
if he ate this.
The third dish.
My Lord.
This preparation is poisoned.
A skilled cook does
not rely only on taste
but he can tell by aroma
of what ingredients
and spices have been used.
And the aroma of this
dish makes it evident
that it is laced with poison.
Splendid!
Open his blindfold.
And you need not taste
the other ingredients.
You can work in the royal kitchen
along with nursemaid.
Now we have to see
how fast Dhumketu can run.
Stulbhadra,
how can you know just from smell
which dish was poisoned
and which was not?
Are you insane?
How could I know just by the aroma
if the vessel was poisoned or not?
I did nothing.
Chandragupta did it all.
You think it was me?
It is not me but mother who helped us.
When mother was placing
the four dishes in the hall
she looked at me
and she tapped at third.
I knew she was saying something.
And what else?
Seeing my life in danger,
my brain worked.
After the Emperor
made the announcement
Chandra took me to the dishes
and he pinched my third finger
and I knew what it meant.
Splendid, Chandragupta!
Help me just as you did with him.
Emperor Dhananand enters!
Bhadrasaal is the
commander of Magadh army
and the fastest runner of Magadh.
If you defeat him in this race
then you will be hired
as the personal envoy of mine.
But, my Lord..
Commander Bhadrasaal's path is
clear while Dhumketu faces a gauntlet?
Such is the path of an envoy.
No matter what obstacles
come in the path..
Be it shards of glass
or rocks and pebbles..
One must deliver the message in
the given time in a discreet manner.
And if the task is challenging
then so will be the path.
If I were to tell you
that you must put this
flame out using this dagger
or to use this water
to cut this cloth apart
then will it be possible for you?
Never.
Since water puts fire out
and a sharp blade
is needed to cut fabric.
In the same manner
it is not enough to gather
might and resources in life.
One must use them
wisely at the right time
and in the right place.
Only then one can
get the desired result.
A lesson from me.
An action from you.
Let the race begin.

================================================================================

Episode: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lCIMQVXQ84I

I have brought some energising
concoction for both competitors.
This is for you and this,
for Bhadrasal.
'This concoction will certainly
create a problem for Dhumketu.'
Oh, give me that, Lady.
While a slave is here,
if you have to do this job
what will His Majesty think?
Give me that. I will give it to him.
No..
- It is fine, it is my job.
- I..
Give it to me. Come on.
'The one on the left is for Dhumketu.'
Imagine that these two are you two.
It is a challenge. While running,
you see each other but no!
Do not be distracted.
Focus on the goal.
I hope that the best man wins.
'I had added an herb
in Dhumketu's concoction'
'that would make him run slower.'
'But Chandragupta switched
the chalices in such a way'
'that I do not understand
which one is which.'
'I wonder what will happen.'
Amatya, you may begin the race.
On the count of three,
the race must begin.
One..
Two..
Three!
Run faster! Faster, Dhum!
You are extremely talented, Dhumketu.
And you..
Despite being the commander of Magadha
and being the best sprinter,
you lost to a child.
Shame on you, Bhadrasal!
I must comprehend over
you continuing to serve
as the commander of Magadha.
But..
Before that, why do we not test
the third friend
of my favourite slave?
So my dear slave
you mentioned that your friend
can count raindrops too.
Just imagine!
What if coins showered from the sky?
It will be so delightful.
So now
your friend must count dropping coins.
If he guesses correctly,
he will get to be an apprentice
to Amatya, in this royal palace.
And if he guesses incorrectly..
Now..
It is time to test your math
but according to my calculation
the price of making one mistake
will be 100 scourges.
Chandra..
I am done for. I cannot do this.
Trust me, Indra.
You can do this.
Do not focus on these
coins but me, okay?
Now you may begin.
So, the shower of coins ends here.
I hope you are done counting.
Y-Yes.. Yes, Your Majesty.
Tell me!
Y-Your Majesty,
it is 5,234.
Amatya..
Is that correct?
No, Your Majesty.
The number stated here is
5,235.
You lost by one coin.
And one mistake leads to 100 scourges.
But, Your Majesty what if I tell you
that the one coin was
never with these coins?
- Then what?
- What do you mean?
I mean..
Only Amatya knows the answer to this.
Amatya?
I only wanted to see, Your Majesty
if this slave was cautious.
Splendid!
The champion of math,
a cautious watcher!
You must hire him too, Amatya.
And my dearest slave
you may show your friends
around the palace.
As you command, Your Majesty.
You have shown us the palace.
But now tell us the truth.
Be honest, Chandra.
How did you count
the coins so quickly?
Yes, Chandra. Please tell us.
I am so nervous.
The entire credit goes
to the Brahmin Chanakya.
While controlling my anger
Chanakya gave me a task.
'You must count these
grains of rice one by one'
'in the time given to you.'
'I will not do this foolish task.'
- 'You may do what you please.
- You must do it, Chandragupta'
'or you will not be
able to leave this place'
'thus not being able to
exact revenge on Dhananand.'
'I have counted these grains of rice.'
'And I know the final count.'
'If you count it incorrectly,
you must start again.'
'Your time starts'
'now!'
Acharya Chanakya made
me do that task so many times
that I can truly count
raindrops before they hit
the ground.
Mother, you must find a way
to show that slave
Chandragupta his place.
Being the commander of Magadha,
I have been humiliated by him today.
This problem is way
above our personal problems.
This is getting out of hand.
In very little time, that slave
has become very dear to His Majesty.
And at the pace that
he is moving forward
soon, His Majesty
will only listen to him.
The time is not far
away when our words
will be meaningless to His Majesty.
Impossible!
His Majesty will listen to me.
Be it today or in future.
He has assigned his three friends in
three different parts of the palace.
The royal kitchen the royal
treasury and the royal guards.
But being hired and
being able to do the work
are poles apart.
We must quickly get rid of the three.
- But how?
- Leave that to me.
Firstly, we must keep an
eye on Chandragupta and his friends
while we wait for the perfect time.
We need just one chance.
He gained this importance
in the eyes of His Majesty
but he will be humiliated as quickly.
I will ruin his imagine.
High Majesty has assigned
such high positions to everyone
but he will be the one
who will punish them to death.
This is the place
where the robes are washed.
Mother.
Did you ensure that
there is nobody else here?
Is anyone keeping an eye on us?
Rest assured, Mother.
There is nobody else here.
Lady, Chandra mentioned
that you make delicious laddoos.
Stop it, Stul..
Yes, I do make them.
You will get some too
but only if you share
them with your friends.
So will you share?
This is from me
for your success.
A small reward.
Hereon, I do not just have one son
but four.
Always be victorious.
Do not cry anymore, Mother.
Embrace these tears
and make them your strength.
Because I want strength.
I want inspiration to exact revenge.
Everyone will see the first
move of our upheaval, soon.
Because of your strong
connection with His Majesty
and his favours,
many people here envy you.
And they are watching you
like hawks.
They seek just one chance
to insult you before him.
So, son, you must make cautious moves.
Every day will be
a new test for you, hereon.
Look!
Right there.
These carts contain
the wealth that Dhananand took
from his people in the name of taxes.
This is Dhananand's greatest strength.
Dear Lord! How will we sustain
before his endless strength
and wealth, Acharya?
By stealing
some wealth from him.
You can take some
strength from your enemy
to bring strength to yourself.
If these carts are
being guarded so well
I am certain his treasury must
have a hundred times the security.
And stealing from there is impossible.
Come with me.
Why are we here?
Did you see what this animal did?
It ate some groundnuts
and is saving some for later.
You are right.
Dhananand is like this animal.
He is so insecure about his wealth
that he does not keep all
his wealth only in his treasury.
He has some of it hidden elsewhere
to come to use when he needs it.
Are you implying
that he steals from his own treasury
and keeps it somewhere
far away from the palace?
Yes.
And you must
find out about that secret place.
To check the authenticity
of gold it is rubbed on a stone
then boiled in heat
then struck by hammers
after which is it purified by water.
Whatever can pass
such tests is pure gold
and whatever does not, is copper.
Similarly in order to test
whether a person is good or evil
there are a few criteria
which one needs to keep in mind.
A good person can experience anger
but unlike an evil person
he will display his
anger against injustice.
Before someone who is superior
even an evil person surrenders.
But a truly kind person is one
who treats the ones who
are beneath him, with respect.
And hence, if you wish to have
gold or the company of good people
you must decide after
keeping these criteria in mind.
These are my principles.
Make the right choice.
They will transport it
to a place away from the palace.
Let's go.
Those 12 soldiers will transport the
wealth to the secret place on horses.
Stop! There is some
hiding below the chariot.

================================================================================

Episode: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQ580qcW2kI

Dhananand is much like this ape.
He is so possessive about his wealth
that he does not store
all of it in the royal treasury.
He stores a part
of it at a secret place
to make use of it in his bad days.
Are you saying
that Dhananand steals
wealth from the royal treasury
and stores it at
a place away from the palace?
Right.
You have to find that place.
Compared to the royal treasury the
security of that place will be lesser.
That is because he would want
to maintain secrecy of that place.
You may proceed.
Sir
I have been sweeping this part of the
royal treasury since early morning.
I thought I was hired
to maintain accounts.
But this..
Let alone maintaining accounts.
Until I develop trust
in you I will not allow you
to roam around this place.
Look at these slaves.
They have been working here for ages.
They have earned my trust.
Stick to the instructions
provided to you.
Off you go!
Carry on.
Stop.
Close the door.
Leave the rest of wealth there.
Make it fast!
'Why did he ask to store
a part of wealth outside?'
'Is it the part of wealth
Acharya was talking about?'
Stay alert.
I asked you to mind your own business.
Broom this place!
'He has posted these 12
soldiers to guard this wealth.'
'I have to inform Chandra about it.'
Acharya was right.
Dhananand stores a part of the wealth
at a secret place somewhere else.
But where?
Chandra, seems like those
12 soldiers were posted
to guard the wealth.
Were they wearing special
horse riding boots?
Yes. That is what they wore.
That suggests they will transport
it to a place away from the palace
much like Acharya has said.
Those 12 soldiers
will transport the wealth
to the secret place on horses.
Let's follow them.
What are we waiting for, Chandra?
Let the night befall.
They will surely transport the
wealth in the darkness of the night.
Come on!
Make it fast.
'Why have these horses
changed their movement?'
'How far is that secret place'
'where Dhananand hides
his secret treasure?'
'If something happens to me'
'then he will have to
acquire his state again.'
'He will have to return
to take his father's revenge.'
'Do not waste your tears now, Mother.'
'Save these tears and
make them your strength.'
'Because I need strength.'
'I need motivation,
so that I can take revenge.'
'Beloved.'
'Our son, Chandragupta is taking
his first step against Dhananand.'
'And his victory in this task will be
the first sacrifice in this revolution.'
'Our son needs our blessings today.'
'I hope that he will return safe.'
Stop the chariot!
'It seems like we've
arrived at that secret place.'
What happened, Mister Amatya?
You have asked us to stop the chariot
before reaching the secret
place for the first time today.
Horse is such an animal
betraying whom is very difficult.
When we left from the palace,
then we were alone.
But an uninvited guest
has joined us on the way
who is hiding under
the chariot right now.
He is thinking that we
will not get to know about this.
The changing movement of
horses revealed someone else's plan.
Whoever you are,
just come out right now
if you want to stay alive!
Bring that intruder out right now.
I am giving you a last warning.
Step out.
Soldiers, look who is hiding beneath.
Attack! He should not escape.
I will inform the king right now.
That is why you are
a soldier and I am Amatya
because I do not inform the king
when a problem arises.
I inform him after solving it.
I hope you always remember
these words of Amatya Rakshas.
- Will you remember it?
- Yes.
Your Majesty,
on the occasion of your father
Late King Padmanand's birthday
the neighbouring kings
have sent these gifts
in his honour.
But, Bhadrasaal
I can see only nine gifts here
whereas we have 15
neighbouring kingdoms.
Yes, Your Majesty.
But you know that the six strong kings
are under the rule of the Kshatriyas.
That is why..
Did you hear that, Amatya
These Kshatriyas do not
miss a chance of humiliating me.
They have not learnt a lesson
even from what happened at Piplivan.
I will have to do something.
Yes, it is time
to bring the six kings
under the control of Magadha.
No. No.
I think there is no point in waiting.
All the 15 kings should be
brought under the control of Magadha
so that no Kshatriya
can humiliate me in future.
Amatya, get the army
ready for the war.
I am sorry.
I am sorry, Your Majesty.
But I would not suggest this war.
Think about it, Your Majesty.
Such a big war
can empty the treasure of our palace.
And as a result
we will have to collect
more tax from the people.
According to me, neither this decision
nor this time is right.
Time.
Decision.
Amatya, it is in our control
to change the time and decision.
And I very well know
how to control the 15 kings
and when and where
the resources for it
can be arranged from.
I lost, Acharya.
I could not even find out
where Dhananand hides his treasure.
When I failed in
doing such a simple task
how will I be able to face Dhananand?
How can I build an army against him?
How will the revolution begin?
Acharya, doing all this within
a month looks impossible to me.
Chandragupta,
a warrior who fights and falls down
does not fail in a war.
Somebody who loses
the courage of getting up
and fighting again after
falling is the one who loses.
Look at this ant, Chandragupta.
Look how it is holding a
small piece of sweet in its mouth
and it is trying to
take it to the anthill.
It falls every time.
But it does not accept defeat.
It gets back to work
with courage and bravery.
Just wait and watch.
It will succeed at the end
because the repeated failures
has given it a valuable
lesson about success.
If it was so easy to find
Dhananand's secret treasure
many people would have reached there,
Chandragupta.
If you want to locate that treasure
you will have to make
infinite and several attempts.
You will have to try your level best.
You have the power of bravery
and determination, Chandragupta.
Now, you have to learn
how to convert a defeat into victory.
According to you,
how is this possible?
It is time for you
to learn weapon skills.
Can you see this bow?
The string is an important part of it
because the targeted arrow is
sent to the destination by the string.
But for the arrow to reach its target
the string has to go back.
Similarly,
the people who work below us in life
can help us to reach our destination
only when we step back
and give them a chance to come forward
and let them showcase their talent.
But
along with the pull
the string needs to be tied too.
Otherwise,
the arrow does not gain the speed.
Give freedom to the people
whom you want to work.
But it is also necessary
to be strict with them.
You will not be able to reach the
target if you give too much freedom.
The teachings are mine
and the destiny is yours.
'A master and his disciple lit'
'the first fire of revolution
for unanimous India.'
Make the enemy's weakness
your biggest strength.
Deprive him of his wealth
and make him a pauper.
'Will the master's
plan be successful?'
'The first chapter
of disciple's revolution.'

================================================================================

Episode: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4GnAtIkFp4

Come, Chandragupta.
It is now time to
test your archery skills.
Take this bow and arrow.
Target those birds.
Oh! Are you teaching me archery
like how Dronacharya
taught his pupil, Arjun?
I see.
But let me tell you one thing,
Acharya.
Nothing of that sort
is going to happen.
I am not Arjun and you
are not Dronacharya, the teacher.
I will miss my target
even if the object is
just few meters away from me.
If you are done with your lecture
shall we start this?
Do not point it up.
Point it in front.
Try again.
Did you see that?
I told you! I cannot do this.
Than think that this
target as those enemies
who are disturbing
the balance in Magadha.
Loot these businessmen!
- If they restrain, kill them.
- Loot everything.
- Come on!
- Hey!
Help!
Safeguard everyone!
Go, inform the emperor.
Chandragupta,
take this and point it at your aim.
Finish these enemies.
If we do not gain control
over them they will destroy Magadha.
Focus on your target and finish them.
- Loot everything.
- Help me.
- Help me. Help me.
- Take him.
- Hey, leave it.
- Help me.
Help me.
Every unsuccessful attempt of yours
will empower these enemies even more
and the innocent people
of Magadha will bear its brunt.
Focus on it and finish it!
- We must inform the emperor
about this soon. - Sure.
- Everyone, let's go.
- Let's go.
Let's go.
Everyone, let's go. Let's go.
Let's go to the emperor.
A lot of people have hopes on you
that you will rid
Magadha of its darkness.
Chandragupta, you have again
let your anger dominate you.
Learn to control your anger.
Learn to channel it in a right way.
- Do not let it control you.
- Stop it!
Enough of your teaching!
I can never learn archery
because that is not my job.
How can you teach me archery
when even you do not know it?
I am not a useless student
but you are a useless teacher.
It takes enormous skill
and hard work to build a fine bow.
And you have broken it.
As a punishment, you will build one.
I have never done that before.
Every person does a lot of
things for the first time in life.
Go.
How did you let this happen, minister?
How did you go wrong?
You could not ensure
the security of the ones
who are so important to us?
After all, how did you
let all this happen to them?
They are not just the
businessmen of Magadha.
They are our very support system.
Take this incident very seriously
as if it happened on me.
They are the real assets of Magadha.
Magadha is nothing without
these businessmen.
What if they decide to leave Magadha
for their safety?
No. No. No.
Make this announcement.
Those who have attacked on
them will face the same punishment
as what they would have,
for attacking me.
The punishment will be so harsh
that they will rather
prefer dying.
Yes, Your Majesty.
I will announce it right now.
Stop, Amatya..
What if the fear of punishment
does not stop the bandits?
I have a solution!
Bhadrasaal!
Yes, Your Majesty?
Appoint soldiers for the merchants.
Of course, Your Majesty.
Merchants, the soldiers will
protect you completely in Magadha.
I beg your pardon, Your Majesty
but appointing soldiers
for the merchants is not good.
If we appoint them in the capital
who will then mind
the borders and protect us?
To do this, we will need a huge force,
Your Majesty.
This will directly affect the tax.
Which is lots of tax.
Did you people hear that?
I want to help you all.
But this means that there
will be increase in tax.
Do not say that, Your Majesty.
We are ready to pay more tax.
Just give us complete protection.
If you do want to pay me more tax
I cannot stop you.
Give them the protection, Amatya.
But, Your Majesty..
Okay, Your Majesty.
You made this bow after
working very hard, Chandragupta.
So I hope that you will think
twice before breaking any bow
in anger in the future.
You have crafted an amazing bow,
Chandragupta.
"Chanakya.."
"Chanakya.."
Now it is time
that you were given a proper target.
There is your target.
Have you gone crazy, Acharya?
Do I practice with
my mother as the target?
No, Son.
I am here to remind you of
the bad things Dhananand has done.
But to succeed, you will
have to rise above all your feelings
your anger,
and focus only towards your goal.
This is your target.
This is your enemy!
You will have to pierce
it with your arrow.
And I know that you can do it,
Chandra.
What if I miss the target?
- No..
- You can do it, Chandra.
Wield your bow and let loose an arrow.
End your enemy! Finish Dhananand!
Take your aim, Chandra.
If something happens to me'
'then he must return
to avenge his father's death.'
"Chandragupta Maurya.."
Where were you? You are my bodyguard.
So you should always be with me.
Do you not know what
is going on in Magadha?
The merchants are being
looted in the broad daylight!
What if they try to loot me?
I always have so many
expensive ornaments.
You should be vigilant, Servant.
They might be waiting
inside the palace
waiting for the right opportunity.
You tried to loot His Majesty's wealth
after looting the
merchants of Magadha!
You've invited your death by doing so.
- Bhadrasaal!
- Yes, Amatya.
- Take them as prisoners.
- Soldiers!
Princess! I was away from you
because from many days, I observed
that you don't seem to
be happy about my presence.
My presence makes you impatient.
No, I don't stay with you.
But I've always been eyeing you.
Okay. I've got a flower.
You gave the flower
to an ordinary maid servant
though I was present here.
So, what's wrong in it, Princess?
An ordinary servant gave an ordinary
flower to an ordinary maid servant.
Anyways, I had got you
the rare multi-coloured flower.
If even that is not enough,
let me know.
I'll get the entire flowers
of the garden and gift them to you.
You aren't fit to gift
a flower to my maid servant.
Come, let's go.
Sound of a flute, at this hour!
It looks like these are the robbers
who robbed the merchants of Magadha.
They won't be spared.
King, these are the robbers
who have challenged your majesty,
your ego and your nature.
Here they are.
The culprits are in front of you.
They deserve only one punishment.
The death sentence.
I know it, Amatya.
Among all the musical instruments
flute is my favourite
because it serves
two purposes at once.
Firstly, it improves
the respiratory capacity.
Secondly
it converts my inner strength
to rhythmic music.
But, what is the connection
between the robbers and a flute?
Of course there's
a connection, Amatya.
Just like this flute
even these people were
serving my dual purposes.
They hadn't come to rob our wealth but
had come to increase my wealth.
Get it.
This is the wealth
that was robbed from the merchants.
I am sorry to ask you, Emperor.
I couldn't understand it.
If you get to understand
everything now
how will I feel happy about it?
Robbers!
But these are our soldiers, Emperor.
Undoubtedly, Amatya.
As I had told you
that we can arrange funds
to attack the 15
neighbouring kingdoms.
So here it is.
A war means a huge army.
A huge army means huge expenditure.
In Magadha,
the businessmen have lots of money.
If I would have asked
them to increase the tax.
They would've quit Magadha.
Due to which our reputation
and finances would be hurt.
That's why I instructed our
soldiers to disguise as robbers
and attack the businessmen.
Due to this, not only did I hit one
nor two
but three targets with a single move.
Wealth, prestige, and..
Increase in tax.
You're right.
Just remember
what were your fears
about the royal treasury.
Magadha and Dhananand's
treasury couldn't
reduce at any cost.
Amazing!
'Even this treasure may
be taken to the secret location.'
'This time, I will surely
find out where that place is.'
Without breaking the tough
outer shell of the coconut
its sweet water cannot be consumed.
But if we throw the
coconut hard on the ground.
The coconut will surely break
but it's sweet water will be wasted.
That's why if we want to
enjoy the sweet water of the coconut
we must target
at one point and constantly hit it.
Only then can we get to enjoy
the sweet water of the coconut.
Just like this, even in our lives
to attain success
only hard work isn't enough.
If we need to succeed,
we need to set the target
and constantly work towards it.
Only then will you
get to taste success.
Teachings are mine
but the destiny is yours.
'A master and his disciple lit'
'the first fire of revolution
for unanimous India.'
Make the enemy's weakness
your biggest strength.
Deprive him of his wealth
and make him a pauper.
'Will the master's
plan be successful?'
'The first chapter
of disciple's revolution.'

================================================================================

Episode: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRvO9LbWx_Y

How can a king be so greedy and evil
that he robs his subjects
and makes them pay security tax?
Disgusting!
How can you be happy because of it?
Because
this new opportunity
has abated my anger.
An opportunity?
What are you talking about?
The money that Dhananand
has robbed from
the people of Magadha..
He will definitely send
it to that secret place.
That would be
Chandragupta's opportunity
to regain that money.
Acharya,
if you were not so
grumpy and difficult
we would have been best friends.
On this note, give me a clap.
What is your plan?
What is my plan?
I will follow that carriage again
which goes to that secret place
from the royal palace.
But this time, I will make sure
that no one sees me.
No, you will not do that.
No? What do you mean?
I mean that if you go alone
you will travel faster
but if you four go together
then you will travel far.
What do you mean?
It means
that I will not go alone
but all of us will form a troop
and find the secret place
where Dhananand is
amassing his wealth.
Oh! It is a great idea!
You said that we should
move together to travel far.
Now, tell me
how do we unite and find
Dhananand's secret place?
You will have to find
the solution yourself.
But before leaving
I would like to teach you a lesson.
Remember
that all four of you have different
personalities and different thinking.
Acharya did not tell us the plan
but left a riddle behind.
He left
because he has shown
us the master key of the plan.
Now, listen to me carefully
that how we will find
Dhananand's secret wealth together.
Tonight, the wealth stolen
from the subjects of Magadha
will be taken to that secret place.
As soon as Amatya
Rakshas and his soldiers
load the carriage with treasure
Indra will go to Stulbhadra.
Stulbhadra will be waiting
in the royal kitchen
under the pretence of cleaning it.
As soon as Indra informs Stulbhadra
that the carriage carrying the
wealth has left the palace premises
then, Stulbhadra, you will
signal us through a special smoke.
In the night, when the royal kitchen's
stove is extinguished it emits smoke.
So, no one will suspect anything.
As soon as Stulbhadra sends the signal
Dhumketu and I will become alert.
They have left the palace.
Chandra, are you ready?
I always stay alert.
Whoever had tried to
steal the king's wealth
will try again to fulfill his aim.
So, we will have to be cautious.
- Are we ready?
- Yes, we are ready!
The situation that
will be in our favour
is to fulfill the breach in the
security that happened the last time
Amatya Rakshas will
appoint more soldiers.
No screen is better than a crowd.
We will use it to our advantage
and I will take the
place of one of the soldiers
to find Dhananand's secret wealth.
Hurry up!
Where are they going
to take the treasure
through the river Ganga?
Bring the boat!
Those who do not have
the special bracelet, move back
and disembark the boat.
Hurry up!
Turn around!
'Where did the boat go?'
'Now, how will
I find that secret place?'
We lost the opportunity again!
I am unable to find out where and how
they are taking the treasure
through the river Ganga!
Moreover, the great Acharya
is spreading smoke instead of
planning to find the secret treasure!
Three of you,
ask him what we should do.
And you three..
Indra!
Dhumketu!
Indra! Dhumketu! Stulbhadra!
Where are you?
- Indra..
- They have disappeared
in the smoke spread by me.
If you can find your friends
then you will find
answers to your questions.
This is ridiculous.
If I know that they are around here
then why should I look for them?
Chandra, we are here.
Hey.. You were standing behind me.
Then how did I miss to find you?
Because they were hidden
behind this smoke.
This is not only smoke
but a screen as well.
I hope that you have found
answers to your questions.
I got it.
Amatya Rakshas had created the smoke
near the river, Ganga, to fool us.
It was a screen.
It was to make us think
that he had taken the treasure
far away through the river, Ganga.
But he did not go anywhere.
- Am I right?
- Keep speaking.
I am listening to you.
But there was only water.
It was the Ganga and
it was flowing freely.
It means..
You are on the right path.
You have read the situation correctly.
So..
Dhananand has hidden
his secret treasure there.
No one can imagine reaching
or looking for a treasure there.
In the depths of Ganga.
Dhananand's secret treasure
is hidden on the riverbed.
A place where no one other
than Dhananand can reach.
Dhananand is one of the
best swimmers of this country.
So, for him,
to reach that secret place..
The bed of the river, Ganga..
It is easy for him.
Great! This is unbelievable.
Even if we know that Dhananand
has hidden his secret treasure
in the bed of the river, Ganga
still, the problem exists.
Where has he hidden the
treasure in that huge river?
Now, how will this problem be solved?
I have a solution
to solve this problem.
Come with me.
Acharya! This oil!
I had kept it to fry some Puris.
By adding water to it, you
have ruined both the water and oil.
Now, neither can
I fry Puris in this oil
nor can this water be
used to abate someone's thirst.
What were you going
to tell us by doing this?
I want to tell you
that oil always floats
above the water.
Yes, but we know that.
Then also learn
that the difference
between oil and water
will take you to
Dhananand's secret treasure.
I understood
the meaning of your words, Acharya.
When you have understood it,
make your friends understand as well.
Indra and Stulbhadra
both of you will have to ensure
that the coins that are
taken to Dhananand's secret place
are coated with oil.
I will drench that boat with
oil which will carry the money.
If we do this
then no one will be able to stop me
from reaching that secret treasure.
The kitchen supplies are here.
Bring it here. Hurry up.
Get it down.
I hope that until
I drench this boat with oil
Indra and Stulbhadra would have
coated the sacks of money with oil.
Stulbhadra, what did you do?
Can you not walk properly?
You broke the oil container!
Forgive me, Amatya Rakshas.
I will get someone
to clean it quickly.
'The work is done.'
'All the sacks containing
money are coated with oil.'
Remember this.
There should be no security breach.
If it happens
then you all know the consequence.
Move!
'Amatya Rakshas is
going back to the palace'
'after depositing today's
money at the secret place.'
Come on!
Rakshas and his
soldiers have gone far.
All of you, come out.
Come on.
I am still unable to understand that
why we did the things that we did.
I mean.. Why did Chandra
drench the boat with oil?
Why did Indra coat the coins with oil?
And why did I lose my Puris?
What does it mean?
Abate their curiosity, Chandragupta.
Amazing!
You are really amazing,
my dear Sister.
You have brought me
a horse that can match up
to my late horse, Toofan!
But I want to know
how you chose it.
I had heard our special
soldiers talking
about how this horse's gait had
alerted them to the presence of thieves.
'The modified gait of the horse
has foiled someone's plan.'
'When we left the palace,
we were alone.'
'But on the way,
an uninvited guest joined us'
'who is now hiding
beneath the chariot.'
'Whoever you area,
if you want to live come out now!'
So, Brother, is this horse not
agile, intelligent and faithful?
It is worthy of the King of Magadha.
Is it not?
'Special soldiers?'
'They just do the task of taking
my wealth to the secret place.'
'It means'
'that someone is trying
to rob my secret treasure.'
'Who is courageous enough'
'to eye my treasure?'
'The fire-lit trail of oil
will take us to that secret place.'
This is the place where Dhananand's
secret treasure is hidden.
I am coming to take your treasure,
Dhananand.
'I will have to find that person'
'who is poised to steal my treasure.'
If we cannot see our
face in the mirror clearly
then we try to clean the mirror
and the reflection
becomes clear again.
What if we are unable
to see the reflection clearly
even after cleaning the mirror?
Have you ever thought
why this happens?
Because many times,
the dirt is not on the mirror
but it clouds our eyes.
In the same way
if we are unable to find our aim
then it is not necessary
that the path or the aim is faulty.
Your vision and the way of thinking
can also be faulty.
So, at certain times
we should clear our vision
instead of the mirror.
My ethics..
Your destiny.
Amatya must have witnessed
that incident with the thief.
The thief who eyed on my treasure.
I have to find him
as soon as possible.

================================================================================

Episode: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7bywrSt0jx0

'Is someone trying to
steal my secret treasure?'
'Who dares to eye my treasure?'
'I have to find the culprit
as soon as possible.'
Brother
do you like my gift? Tell me.
In case you do not like it,
I will let the slave keep it.
Slave?
Are you referring to that bodyguard?
Durdhara, royals like us
do not take interest in slaves.
How could you even think of that?
I want him to be
forever loyal to you.
He should always answer to
your call at any time of the day.
I am delighted to know
that you care about me.
But whenever I summon someone
no matter where he is
he has to show up before me
no matter what the circumstance is.
The slave need not use the horse.
Therefore
I will keep it with me.
Thanks for this gift, Sister.
I am delighted that
you appreciated my gift.
I believe
much like you,
even Amatya must have witnessed
that incident with the thief.
The thief who eyed on my treasure.
But he chose to keep
the fact from me.
Why?
Who is the thief?
I have to find him
as soon as possible.
Is it I who will retrieve
Dhananand's secret treasure
from the depth of Ganges?
Acharya, you act strange.
Sometimes you amaze me with your wit
and at times,
your naivety makes me laugh.
Acharya, I am only human.
I am not a fish
who can go down deep the river.
In order to steal
Dhananand's secret treasure
you need not become a fish
but to inherit some traits of it.
Do not forget the
fact that even you can do
what Dhananand is capable of.
Wrap it around your ankle.
Follow my instructions.
Are you going to treat
him as a bait for fishes?
I will soon find that out.
Do you also feel,
like me that Acharya has lost
his mind?
If you want to reach the riverbed
you do not require strong lungs.
What is necessary is
your firm determination
and control over your senses.
You will have to control
your heartbeat and breath.
You have to learn to regulate
it based on the situation.
Chandragupta,
if your body fails to support you
remember who your enemy is.
He is Dhananand!
Always remember him.
You should know how
deadly your enemy is.
Knowledge about your enemy's strengths
shall consistently push you
towards perfection and excellence.
'You have to reach till the point'
'which nobody, other than Dhananand,
has been able to reach.'
'While controlling your breath
you have to reach the riverbed.'
'Only then, you will be able
to steal Dhananand's secret treasure.'
Come to the bank, Chandra..
- Come..
- Come here soon..
Indra, go and save him!
No! Wait!
Let me go!
He may die! Let me save him!
- Chandra..
- I am following Acharya's orders.
Nobody must go to save him.
Chandra!
It has been a long time since
His Majesty has jumped into the river.
Amatya..
Shut up!
Let me remind you that he is a king.
He will surface like always for sure!
Chandragupta!
Chandra!
You..
You tried to kill me!
You all saw the way
he tried to kill me!
I only tried to increase
your tolerance, Chandragupta.
If you want to reach out
for the secret treasure of Dhananand
then this is the only way out.
I do not know why
but your guidance to the
desired path leads me to my death!
Sometimes I doubt
the path you show me.
I do not want to follow your path!
Chandra!
Acharya,
this time you crossed your limit.
Yes.
I did cross my limit.
And I have no regrets about it.
Because if Chandragupta wants to
steal the secret treasure of Dhananand
then he has to be a more flexible
diver and swimmer than Dhananand.
Only then Chandragupta
can reach his goal.
The diver from Magadha
who had gone in the water
I have buried him in
the depths of the Ganges.
Both of you claim to be
the best divers of Magadha.
Then go and find what I want.
If you complete this challenge
then along with special gifts
both of you will get
the reward of your choice.
Go!
Forgive me, Your Majesty..
But why all this?
When you very well know
that your treasure is safe
then what was the need
of sending them down there?
Are you trying to teach me
what I have to do in my own kingdom?
Amatya, this is the reason
you did not find
it necessary to alert me
that somebody was prying
on my secret treasure.
That someone was curious
to know about it.
Did you think that by
keeping this fact from me
I would never be
able to know about it?
I want to know
if my secret treasure is safe or not!
And this will be possible
by the victory of the divers
or their defeat!
Pardon me, Your Majesty..
But please do not suspect my ways.
My aim was not to
hide the fact from you
but bring the thief to you.
Please forgive me for doing that.
Forgiveness! Forgiveness!
Do you even know
what forgiveness means?
Forgiveness means a mistake.
Do not commit any mistake again.
It is your duty to inform me
about the developments in my kingdom.
And it is my duty to
see if it is important or not.
Do not assume
that I missed my target.
Today, my aim was only
to warn you
that whenever in the future..
Whenever..
Never keep any secret from me.
Especially when it is
related to my secret treasure.
The expert divers
of Magadha could not even
reach your secret place, Your Majesty.
This means your treasure
as always, is secured.
Secured, you say!
Nothing is safe, Amatya.
When I can do this
then there has to be
a diver in the world
who can reach the depths
of the Ganges holding his breath.
There has to be someone like me.
You..
You..
Chandra..
You should not have come here.
When a son gets the news
that his mother has been tortured
then her son has to come
to her rescue.. Right, Mother?
When I came to know
that cruel lady
punished you by making
you walk on ember..
Then I felt
that with that ember,
I should burn her alive!
And then I thought of seeing,
my mother's wounds first.
So that I can hurt her more than this.
You have gone through
so much of distress and
you are still facing all that.
And I am not tolerant.
Perhaps, I am not capable
of being the prince of Piplivan.
I am just someone you
should feel ashamed of.
I am a disappointment to you,
my family
and even for Acharya Chanakya
who is trying hard
to help me.
And I am failing, every time.
I am disappointing you.
Mother, I am not as capable
and brave as you are.
I was not this brave before.
There was a time when
I had this fear of heights.
What? How can you?
Trust me, I was scared of heights.
This thought used to
trouble me a lot back then.
That a timid woman
like me does not deserve
to be the queen of Piplivan.
That I do not deserve to be the wife
of the brave Chandravardhan Maurya.
And then, I got you in my womb.
When you were eight
months old in my womb
a priestess told me
that there is a temple on
the highest peak of the Piplivan.
She told me that if I walk
till there barefoot and pray
it will be very
auspicious for my baby.
Even the thought of climbing
such a height scared me.
Yet, I decided to trek that hill.
Because I wanted to
seek blessings for you.
But that trek
turned out to be more painful
and difficult than I had imagined.
I gave up when the
temple was just closer.
My legs stopped.
And then
my brave child
you motivated me.
You hit me with your
little legs inside
and made me reach the peak.
I felt like your soft touches
were motivating me to
overcome my fear and go ahead.
I am with you.
Yes, Chandra.
It was you who made me
strong during that tough time.
Chandra, it was you
because of whom I completed
that impossible pilgrimage.
And, Chandra, it is you
who has been giving me the
strength to face every hardship.
And you are saying that you are weak?
No, Chandra.
Might and bravery is in your blood.
It is inside you.
You just need to realise it, Chandra.
Channel that bravery
into your vision and nature.
Motive yourself,
just how you did to me.
There is one similarity
between time and sand.
When you try to lock
them into your palms
they just slip away.
But if you hold sand firmly
it does not slip away.
Time is like this sand
and perseverance is your firm motive.
If you pursue something
with dedication and focus
success will not slip
away from your hand.
These are my principles.
Make the right choice.
We are in deep trouble, teacher.
Look over there.
It looks like the problematic
one is caught in the net
who tried to take
advantage of the river.

================================================================================

Episode: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1m4XdAuq1U

Teacher, when there is
a huge river flowing nearby.
Why are you filling
in this well with water?
For him.
I am ready for the challenges.
Let's try again.
Think twice, Chandragupta.
Because the challenge this time.
Will be the toughest that
you could have ever faced.
Put forth the best that you can.
This time do not
put be inside a river.
Instead put me in a water body,
getting out from which is tough.
I knew that you were going
to say something like that.
That is why this time.
I have arranged this water reservoir.
Dhananand can stay inside
the water for one and half minutes.
I won't tell you to stay inside
for more or even equal to him.
For now aim to stay inside
the water for a minute.
Come.
Your time starts now.
Grab that rock and keep it over it.
'The fearless mother
whom you are looking at.'
'She was not that fearless
since the beginning.'
'There was a time when
I was afraid of height.'
'It used to haunt me.'
'A coward and frightened woman.'
'Is not worthy enough
to be the queen of Piplivan.'
'Then I had you in my womb.'
'Bravery and feat are
running inside your blood.'
'It's vested upon you.'
'You need to recognise it.'
'Motivate yourself.
The way you've motivated me.'
Teacher!
Teacher, I've committed a mistake.
Forgetfully I've set the
time of two minutes instead of one.
What?
Chandragupta..
Chandragupta..
Miracle. That is a miracle.
You have even crossed
the time frame of Dhananand.
How did you make it possible?
Because I was able to understand
the meaning of your words.
I only recalled the moment
when I was not even born.
While I was living in her
womb with the help of her blood.
I have turned her agony
and tolerance into my strength.
The mother who underwent
immense pain to breathe life
into her offspring.
I was inspired by it and
converted it into my breath.
And that is why
even death couldn't
take away my breath.
Unique.
Your bravery has given you
a new birth, Chandragupta.
Come out.
"Chandragupta Maurya.."
"Chandragupta Maurya.."
Teacher, what's the
requirement of this rock?
The weight of this
rock and Earth's gravity
will help Chandragupta to get
to the bottom of the river quickly.
His time and energy will be saved.
And he'll be able to concentrate
solely on his breath.
May you succeed, student.
Teacher.
Did you call for the boats
to transport the treasure?
No, why?
In that case we are
in deep trouble, teacher.
Look over there.
Oh God!
That's Dhananand.
It seems, he is aware that
someone is after his money.
Everybody hide.
'Where did all the wealth vanish?'
Isn't it perfect weather
for fishing, Amatya?
It looks like the problematic
one is caught in the net
who tried
to take advantage of the river.
Your sixth sense is amazing.
You were right,
somebody has eyed your wealth.
Go and get the one
that is caught in my net.
I wish to see him like
a fish without water.
If they capture Chandra,
his death is certain.
We have to help him.
No! If any of us
is spotted by Dhananand
the entire plan will be foiled.
It will be clear that we
wanted to steal his secret treasure.
Now, it's one and only
Chandragupta's challenge.
Hope Chandra is not in..
No! The teacher has taught
him to survive under water.
So he will be safe.
Even if he survives underwater
how will he escape those
who are waiting to hunt him?
Be ready with your weapons.
'To survive under water, you
shouldn't just control your breath'
'but controlling your
energy is necessary.'
'You will have to
conserve your energy.'
'You will have to trick death.'
'To survive, sometimes we've
to pretend as dead, Chandragupta.'
Why are this divers taking so long?
Surely our divers will come
out with his dead body, my Majesty.
He is tricking us by
hiding below these corpses.
Attack!
Where are you, Chandra?
'Chandra escaped successfully
from Dhananand's security.'
You displayed exemplary courage,
Chandra.
Where is the coach, Bhairav?
Acharya is in.
He's making the flat bread.
What?
We failed in such an
important attempt to steal
Dhananand's secret treasure
and all our efforts were in vain
but coach is busy
preparing flat bread?
Acharya, we started so long back..
Despite all the hard work and efforts
we are back to zero.
Dhananand defeated us again
and you are silent!
So what if Dhananand has changed the
location of hiding his hidden wealth?
We will find it again.
We will loot it again.
We will get more opportunities.
How are you going to take
advantage of this opportunity?
While trying to bake Rotis,
you're burning them.
Oh, yes!
It is really is burnt.
What does one Roti burning do,
Chandragupta?
We still have more flour.
We have fire as well.
And the pan is hot.
More Rotis can be baked.
Do you understand
what I am trying to say?
It is you who does
not understand, Acharya.
The palace might be on
the fire and it must be chaotic!
And here you are talking in riddles!
- Is the palace on fire?
- Yes!
Then go there, Your Highness.
Why waste your time with us here?
I get it. That is what I should do.
You can sit here
and enjoy your burnt Rotis.
I will go to the palace.
Stop, Slave!
"Amatya.."
Where are you going in such a hurry?
Where were you?
Where would I go?
Anyway, why do you ask?
You are the bodyguard of Her Highness
Durdhara and she is looking for you!
Is this how you are you
going to uphold your duty!
What is more important to
you than serving the royal family?
Tell me!
Amatya, forgive me.
- The thing is..
- Be silent!
Your hands..
What would happen to my hands?
Oh!
So you read the palm lines?
Then tell me, what can you
read from the lines on my palms?
I can read that you
just came out of water.
I can read that you are definitely
keeping something from me.
Hail Amatya Rakshas.
His Majesty has summoned you.
Keep this in mind.
I am Amatya Rakshas.
You cannot evade me for long.
What happened?
Why do you all seem so astonished?
This is my precious
and invaluable chamber!
Now, why did I call you all here?
For a while, someone
has been trying to steal my treasure.
He is also trying to loot this.
Your Majesty, our naval
army has searched every corner
of Ganges, coast to coast,
but we did not find the thief
I think he was not able
to withstand out attack and died.
I also think that he was washed
far away due to the flow of the river.
Until I see the corpse of the thief
no one is to tell me that he is dead
because he was not a normal thief.
He searched out my hidden treasure.
He went so deep to the riverbed
of Ganges where not even most
skilled of the swimmers could not go.
From under the water,
he attacked me with my dagger.
His aim was perfect.
Amatya, how do I believe that he
got caught in the flow of the river!
He escaped from my trap.
Who could it be?
Your Majesty
there is someone I suspect.
Slave.
Venom is a great product.
If it is introduced in
the blood stream all of a sudden
it can be fatal and kill.
But the antivenin made from the venom
serves as elixir in
saving thousands of lives.
It means that goodness or
evil does not dwell in an object.
It is in the intent
of the person using it.
So if you want to be safe
and be successful
you should learn to read and understand
the intention of people around you.
Because there is no greater weapon
or shield than intent.
The policies are mine.
The destiny is yours.
Only one person can dream of destroying
your power, kingdom and money.
- What is his name?
- Any doubt. Chanakya.
Your doubt is my belief.
Now you will get him.

================================================================================

Episode: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wp8jGI20Oe4

Who could be so devious
to escape my trap?
Your Majesty
I suspect someone.
'Tell me then.
What do you read from my palm lines?'
'I can read that you
just came out of water!'
'I can read that you are
surely keeping something from me.'
According to me,
only one person can be behind this.
- And that is..
- Chanakya.
Yes, Your Majesty.
I think Chanakya has a hand
in this incident.
This is no time for guessing, Slave!
There is not much difference
between suspicion and assumption.
After the incident
I enquired many people and found
out that Chanakya had sworn to destroy
His Majesty's kingdom.
'You humiliated my hair.'
'I swear that I will destroy
your entire family, Dhananand.'
The responsibility of apprehending him
was given to the chief minister.
Just like the water in the fist
slips from between the fingers,
Chanakya had slipped
from the chief minister's hands.
He has already done this.
So, doing the same would
not be tough for Chanakya.
Silence! Be silent, Slave!
Chief Minister,
do not make your incompetence apparent
by venting your
frustration on the slave.
Tell me.
Why have you not caught Chanakya yet?
Not even your trained
and huge spy network has
not been able to catch him.
Forget about that.
Till date,
you have not been able to get
even a tiny bit of
information about him.
It is because he is not in Magadha,
Your Majesty!
Is he really not in Magadha,
Chief Minister?
Because according to what I heard
he swore not to leave Magadha
until his vow has been fulfilled.
Who better to understand
the importance of a Brahman's vow
better than you?
Right, Chief Minister?
Who knows when the knowledge
will be used as a weapon!
- Find him.
- Okay, Your Majesty.
Not you, Chief Minister.
Only a rat can make a hole
in a cunning fox's den.
My little spy,
Chandragupta will catch that cunning
and devious Chanakya.
Me?
Your Majesty, should I find Chanakya?
Yes.
You will have to do
this in only one day..
You have just one day.
One day?
Your Majesty.
If this slave finds
Vishnugupta Chanakya
I, Chief Minister Rakshas
will bow down to this lad's feet
and salute him.
Good! Very good..
The chief minister's
pledge will be your reward
if you meet this challenge
within the time limit.
If you are unsuccessful
you will punished
for raising your finger
against the chief minister.
Capital punishment.
'Wonderful, Slave.'
'You have invited your death.'
'It is impossible to find
Chanakya in such a short time.'
How? How do I confine
Chandragupta inside the palace?
Do I chop his legs off?
No..
Do I imprison him?
No! I do not understand
what I should do!
Your Highness,
His Majesty has given that slave
an important task but you are
trying to make him unsuccessful.
Yes!
If he finds Chanakya
within a day's time
he will become more important
and beloved to His Majesty.
He might even ask
for a title as a reward.
No, I have to do something.
I have to stop him
so that he fails to
complete the challenge.
So that he always stays
under my boots as my bodyguard.
Not under your boots.
He has become a beloved in your eyes,
Durdhara.
That is the reason you do not want him
to complete the task
and go away from you.
What has happened to you all!
That king has given me the
most difficult job in the world
and instead of giving me suggestions
you guys are going away from me.
What do you want us to do, Chandra?
We did not expect this from you,
Chandra.
How could you name Acharya
in front of Dhananand?
How could you put his life in danger?
He is right, Chandra.
We admit that he
makes you work too hard.
But, Chandra, this does not mean
that you will frame him
and settle the scores with him.
This is not right, Chandra.
Do the three of you think
that it was my dangerous
idea to mention
Acharya's name in front of the king?
- This means..
- This means..
Yes.
You have guessed it right.
After sending the three
of you to the palace
Acharya stopped me
in private and told me..
'Dhananand will not
easily spare the person'
'who has an eye on
his secret treasure.'
'At this moment, he and Amatya'
'will be trying their
level best to find that thief.'
'Everyone will be
suspected by then now.'
'Everyone will be a suspect for them.'
'And you will also become'
'a suspect very soon.'
'How?'
'Have you seen
the fingers of your hands?'
'By seeing them, anybody can guess'
'that you have been in
the water for a long time.'
'In the water, where Dhananand
had hidden his secret treasure.'
Amazing.
Acharya's words have come true.
Amatya suspected you after
seeing the wrinkles on your fingers.
And he was about to inform the king.
Yes.
And Acharya gave me a suggestion..
'Before they start thinking about you'
'you will have to distract
them towards somebody else.'
'Towards whom?'
'Towards me.'
'You will have to
make Dhananand believe'
'that I had attempted
to steal his hidden treasure.'
'I had planned the entire drama.'
Even Acharya had no idea
that the situation would
worsen to this extent.
I will have to find the target
through which I wanted
to distract Dhananand.
And I will have to
do it within one day.
Oh, God! What will happen now?
He has created this problem.
So, he will have
to give a solution too.
I am going to meet Acharya now.
Servant!
Yes, Princess.
I want to drink
the cold water of the lake
which is located in the
southern side of the palace.
But my leg is hurting a lot.
Shipra.
No problem, Princess.
I will get water from
the lake for you immediately.
No, stop!
You may bring water from anywhere
and tell me that it is from the lake.
I do not trust you.
You take me there.
Princess, you heard just now
about the challenge given
to me by the king. How can I go?
The king has challenged his servant
and my order is for my bodyguard.
Inform the king that
I wanted your help.
'Oh, God!'
'Where are you stuck, Chandragupta?'
'This brother and sister'
'are one better than the other.'
'How do I reach Acharya quickly now?'
'Servant, you had promised
to find Chanakya within a day, right?'
'Just wait and watch,
how I will make you'
'serve me the entire
day due to my leg pain.'
'Today, this princess'
leg is not injured.'
'My luck is bad.'
'Time is passing.'
'I will have to think
of a plan and fool her'
'and meet Acharya.'
'But how?'
'This princess is
stubborn and uncultured.'
What! What did you tell me?
No. Nothing.
I did not utter a single word.
I was just enjoying this palace.
'I want to drink
the cold water of the lake'
'which is located in the
southern side of the palace.'
'But my leg is hurting a lot.'
'Okay!'
'So, this egoistic princess'
leg is not injured.'
'I will teach her a lesson right now.'
Oh, God! Such a huge serpent?
- Help! Help!
- Serpent?
- Where is it?
- Yes. Here..
Serpent. Help!
- Serpent.
- Run! Help!
Where is the serpent? Where is it?
Run. Why are you..
Hey, did you fool me?
Did you fool the king's sister?
Tit for tat.
Princess,
you had also tried to fool me.
Your leg is fine.
Walking using both your fine legs
and drink the entire water
from the lake.
I have to go for
an important challenge.
Servant, you..
How dare he..
I will not spare him.
'Before attempting this loot'
'I enquired many and found out'
'that Chanakya has vowed
to dethrone Dhananand.'
'I will dethrone you'
'and give this place
to the deserving one.'
'I will not tie my hair'
'until I fulfill my vow.'
'I want Chanakya on my
feet as soon as possible.'
'So that I can kill him
with my own hands.'
What are you saying, Acharya?
Shall I inform Dhananand
where you are hiding?
Yes. This is the only
way to save your life
and to win his trust back.
Sit down. Sit!
Tell me something, Acharya.
Since when do you
have this abnormality?
Do you find difficulty in breathing
or experience sleeplessness?
What?
Are you asking me?
It is obvious.
Acharya, you are behaving abnormal.
Because a normal mind will
never get an idea of suicide.
Who told you that
I want to commit suicide?
Oh!
Informing Dhananand
about your hiding place
is like inviting your death.
He will send his
whole army to kill you.
Listen to me. Just forget your vow.
Tie your hair and
go somewhere very far.
Acharya, we cannot fight his
army with our words.
We actually need to fight with them.
I will say something.
Please do not mind.
How can a soft Brahman like you
know what a war is?
You will not be able to
face his army even for a second.
Dhananand
will behead you
in no time.
You do not worry about my life.
Winning the emperor's trust
is the most important thing now.
Remember this.
Dhanananda's wealth
is not his only power.
His trusted ones
are his support system.
After defeating Amatya Rakshasa,
his most trusted one
and by letting him
know about my hideout
you will win back his trust.
The death of Amatya Rakshas
will be the path of your success.
Okay.
I have saved you once.
I will do it again.
Anyway
I still have some time.
I will think of something.
You will not do anything as such!
You will not intervene to help me
even if Dhanananda's
soldiers try to kill me.
You will not attack them.
Do it for the sake of your mother,
Chandragupta!
At some point of our life
we feel as if we've been
attacked by a storm of problems.
We get only two options
in such hard times.
Either face it or ran away.
Do not be shocked.
Both of them are different options.
First one
run away from the problem
get disappointed and accept defeat.
That is what people generally do.
And the second option is
fight against it.
Because if we are strong
nothing can harm us.
The choice is left to you.
Will you face the problem
and defeat it
or will you just give up?
My strategies, your destiny.
Help!
Do not come closer.
Help! Is anybody there?

================================================================================

Episode: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3Ps7h0k4SE

What is the next solution, Amatya?
Solution six, Your Highness.
To harm using rats.
According to this
we have to let hungry rats
on his face inside a closed room.
Except eating Chanakya's head
they should have nothing else to eat.
Your Majesty,
after that, they will not come out
until they have eaten
through his head.
No, Amatya..
I do not like rats.
They spread filth all around.
Give me some other solution.
Your Majesty, do not take offence
but I am sure that the slave
will not be able to find Chanakya.
Trust my belief.
Hello.. Hello..
Those who begin a job with doubt
will always be unsuccessful,
Amatya Rakshas!
Who are you!
Who gave you the
permission to come in here?
Soldiers, throw him out.
Stop, Amatya Rakshas.
I thought that you
would be busy in completing
the challenge that I'd given you.
But you are acting like a sage, Slave.
Chandragupta?
Forgive me, Your Majesty.
But using this disguise,
I have found Chanakya out.
What?
He is going to come to a wedding
to give blessings in Gomtinagar
tomorrow evening.
And how did you find that out?
Using my disguise
I entered an assembly of Brahmins
heading towards to Takshashila.
I heard secret rumors
about Chanakya there.
To earn their trust
I made them believe
that I am a dedicated
followed of Acharya Chanakya.
That I follow his teachings.
I told them how I got
to people who I had lost.
How he taught me to control my rage.
How he showed me things
of life I never knew to exist.
There is no greater weapon
than belief, Your Majesty.
I made them believe and
got all the information about
Chanakya that I needed.
Very good!
Very good, Slave..
Why are you just
standing there, Amatya?
Prepare the soldiers.
You have to go to Gomtinagar now.
Go and present me
the head of Chanakya.
Of course, Your Majesty.
I will follow your orders.
'Acharya, how will you
escape this trouble by yourself?'
Come, Acharya.
I am fortunate
to have you give blessings
to my daughter on her wedding.
My daughter is eager
to get your blessings.
Amatya will be here with
the army any minute now.
How are you going to
escape from him now, Acharya?
You don't cry, child.
He will not say anything to you.
He has come here not for you
but for me.
No!
He made you vow to your
mother that you won't do anything.
"Amatya.."
"Amatya.."
"Amatya.."
Sage..
The end of your life is here,
Vishnugupta Chanakya.
Your dream of vanquishing
the Magadha Empire
will remain a dream
and never be realised.
My journey has just begun,
Amatya Rakshas.
And my dream will not be realised
until I remove Dhananand
from the throne.
Until I unite the divided India.
But it is still not
too late for you, Amatya.
Abandon the evil and
come over to my side.
Evil?
What you call evil is my duty!
I am upholding it.
As long as I live,
I will continue to do so.
Surely it is with this
mindset that Dronacharya
and Kripacharya
supported the Kauravas.
And the world bore
witness to their sad end.
I am not here to argue
about what is right.
You still have time.
Surrender yourself, Vishnugupta.
I will request to His Majesty
to give you an easy punishment.
He is your emperor, not mine.
You go and uphold your duty.
Go and serve your debt to Dhananand.
I will uphold my duty.
I will pay my debt
towards my motherland.
Vishnugupta,
do not force me to kill a Brahman!
Your Majesty. What are you doing?
Preparations for repenting.
To repent for killing a Brahman.
The same Lord Rama
did after killing Ravan.
The same.
Does that mean you
have found Chanakya?
You can assume that.
Amatya has gone to bring him here.
As soon as I see
Chanakya's severed head
these Brahmins will start
performing the veneration
so that I can cleanse myself
of the sin of killing a Brahmin.
You must be day dreaming
to be thinking of killing me.
You and your soldiers
can't even touch me
let alone killing me.
Right in front of your eyes
I'm challenging all your soldiers
to try and push me out of this circle.
You had come here to kill me
but you've made a mistake.
You have brought very
few soldiers with you.
It will tilt the balance in my favour.
I will help you.
In order to ensure a fair fight,
I will only use one hand
to fight your soldiers.
Without any weapon..
Without any plan..
What are you doing, Acharya?
People behave like fools
when their ends is near.
On seeing his death
standing in front of him
the Brahmin has lost his mind.
What are you looking at? Kill him!
Acharya is holding a weapon
instead of the scripture..
What am I seeing?
"He attacks with power."
"And wins every time he attacks.
"He is dedicated to his country."
What is happening?
I will become unconscious
on seeing this.
"He thinks of revolution in his mind."
"He is Chanakya.."
"He is Chanakya.."
"He is Chanakya.."
"The one who bows
down to the country."
"And kills the enemy."
"He has love and hatred both."
"He attacks as well as kills."
"He is Chanakya.."
"He is Chanakya.."
Kill me, Vishnugupta.
And do a favor to your motherland.
Not now.
I still have to settle an old account.
Yours.
'I respect you'
'so that is why I am giving
you one last chance, Vishnugupta.'
'Stay away from the
borders of Magadh.'
Now it is time to repay that.
I give you your life in charity,
Amatya Rakshas.
Go and tell Dhananand.
He may tighten his
security as much as wants
but I will definitely
loot his secret wealth.
I agree that I was unsuccessful
in my first attempt.
But I will try again
and will be successful.
And then I will build up
an army with his money against him.
You still have time.
If your intellect has awakened
then come to our side Amatya Rakshas.
Otherwise we will meet
again in the battlefield.
"He is Chanakya.."
"He is Chanakya.."
"He is Chanakya.."
No!
Acharya, you never told me
that you are so well
trained in using weapons.
Some qualities and powers are such
that they should be displayed
or used only at the right time.
The situation there was such
and that is why I used a weapon.
But right now the situation
requires you to be
present in the palace.
Oh, but, Acharya..
Go back to the palace right now.
Y-Yes..
I-I going back to the palace..
Please don't point this sword at me.
Greetings.
I am very sad to tell you, Dhananand
that all your plans to kill me
have gone to waste.
Long live the King.
Amatya has entered the palace.
Welcome, my favourite, Amatya..
Never before did the bloodstains on
your clothes give me as much pleasure
as they are today.
These aren't just bloodstains..
They are a mark of respect.
He always considers it
his duty to fulfill all my wishes
and that is why he isn't my minister.
He is my great minister.
Today..
Amatya has reached
a greater level in my eyes.
Amatya, I'm here praising you
and you are not giving me
the thing that I am waiting for.
Where is Chanakya?
Bring Chanakya here.
Amatya, what happened?
- Where is Chanakya?
- He managed to escape, King.
You heard me right, Emperor.
But forgive me, Emperor..
It was necessary to inform you
that Chanakya defeated
Amatya's soldiers
and fled from Gomtinagar.
Is this slave telling the truth?
Tell me everything.
Emperor, I was not present there
but there were others who were present
from whom I heard about this incident.
Forgive me, Emperor..
But I heard that
Chanakya singlehandedly
slayed your soldiers
in a gruesome way.
And that too, only with one hand.
I may be wrong in hearing this
but Amatya was present
during that incident.
Only he can throw
light on that incident.
Please tell us, Amatya.
Was that a false portrayal?
- Was that incident untrue?
- No.
Each word told by him is true.
Amatya!
Forgive me, Your Highness.
Please forgive me.
I made a big mistake.
You're pleading to
the wrong person, Amatya.
Recollect your vow!
Along with the punishment
you have to plead to this slave.
Go.
Okay.
By the way..
My great Amatya, listen.
If you bow down
to my slave
then your head
will be useless to me.
So why not be useful for this razor?
Definitely,
a death of a monk is imminent..
Not Chanakya's
but yours.
Are you seeing these saplings?
Growing into a tree,
is not their only identity.
Nature has hidden
a part below the ground.
So that it remains safe
from prying birds and animals.
The same way
keep your strength
and plans a secret.
Keep them to yourselves only.
So that when the time comes
that can be prove to
be your biggest weapon.
"The truth is a secret."
Just like this radish
an equal amount is below the ground
and above also.
Only when the time comes
it shows it's real identity.
My policies.
Your actions.
Do it soon, minister.
My razor cannot wait anymore.

================================================================================

Episode: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iecyT1LTM4

Minister
I can forgive you by considering
your good track record.
But my razor
does not understand forgiveness.
It is thirsty for blood.
You are my prime minister,
are you not?
So let me tell you.
I will surely kill a Brahman.
But it will not be Chanakya, but you.
The moment I keep
this razor on his neck
start chanting the mantras.
Do it soon, minister.
My razor cannot wait anymore.
'I just wanted to make Amatya,
lose his respect before Dhananand.'
'I did not want to get him killed.'
'What do I do now?'
No. Stop, Amatya.
You are a wise Brahman.
Bowing down before
me neither suits you
nor do I want to bear
the burden of this sin.
Amatya, you are elder
and wiser than me.
I cannot let you touch my feet.
Servant,
you are disregarding my command.
Ones deeds is what makes
him superior and not his age.
Now take Chanakya for example.
He vanquished the emperor
of Magadha with his deeds
and here we have another Brahman whose
deeds made him bow down to a servant.
And now, Chanakya will
hide himself in a place
which perhaps even you can't find.
And do not be so
compassionate towards him.
Had you been in his place
he would not have shown
any sympathy for you.
No, Your Highness.
I am concerned about you.
If you kill a Brahman today
even you will bear
the brunt of that sin.
And all of us here know
that killing a Brahman
is an unforgivable sin.
You are not understanding this.
I am the God of Magadha.
My words are final.
I will kill Amatya with
my razor and that is final.
Is there any way to
safeguard your promise
and also to avoid this sin?
Only Amatya can guide
us in this matter.
Amatya, please enlighten us.
For a Brahman
his knowledge,
respect, honour and reputation
are his roots.
That means everything to him.
If you cut down those
roots of a Brahman
it is equal to killing him.
Good. Very good!
I liked your suggestion, minister!
I liked it a lot.
'The royal food has made you lazy.'
'So you will not get it anymore.'
'You will get the same
food as our servants get'
'that is, jaggery and chickpeas.'
'We snatch all the
royal facilities from you.'
'You will now live
a life of an ordinary man.'
'Amatya Rakshas'
you got defeated by Chanakya,
did you not?'
'You will now take
the weapon training'
'until your hair grow.'
'Try to get back your honour'
'before your they grow.'
Vishnugupta!
'Vishnugupta!'
Why are you wasting your time,
Acharya?
You can cut this into 100 pieces
with your sword in just one go.
No matter how big a weapon is
if we cannot use it the
right way and at the right time
it is a waste.
If you use a weapon with
your mind instead of muscles
you do more with less effort.
Like this.
You are great, Acharya.
I used to think that
you were a mere Brahman
who does not see anything
past his dream of united India.
But now you have made me
realise that a person's thoughts
come out as the truth.
It is with this cleverness of yours
you were able to
trick the Magadha King.
That might just be impossible
to do for anyone else in the world.
I pay my salutations to you, Acharya.
Is that so?
I thought that you
only call me Acharya
but do not accept me as one.
It was just..
And surely, you also feel regret
that you did not give me
proper respect that you should have.
Also that you used to
doubt my knowledge of shastras
and method of teaching needlessly.
Today I have also found out
that you read thoughts as well.
But I am not so good in it, Acharya.
So tell me, how do we get
to Dhananand's secret treasure?
Princess Durdhara.
You are the main bodyguard
of Princess Durdhara.
And now, we will use that.
Through Princess Durdhara,
Dhananand will tell us
where he has hidden his treasure.
Mura, what are you doing?
You should not touch your face
with chilli powder on your hands.
It will cause burning sensation.
Chandra..
That slave cares for you a lot, right?
You also seem to care for him.
Right?
Do you know what?
That slave does not even
look at anyone in the palace
other than you and I.
Everything thinks that
he has gotten very close to me
in a very short time.
And that is true.
God knows why but I feel like
he will betray me someday.
Why do I feel that?
It is because I like him
just as much as you like him
I thought that I should
consult about this with you.
Tell me, Mura.
Why do I suspect him?
It is in your nature to doubt,
Dhananand.
Even your right hand
might doubt your left hand.
Betraying and think of
the one you trust as a traitor
is in your personality.
Ground the spices.
Ground the chilly into a fine powder.
Daima does not like
concessions in her work.
"Amatya.."
"Amatya.."
"Amatya.."
Trikal, I remember
that His Majesty had exiled you.
But if you
kill someone for me
I will talk to His Majesty
and open the doors
of Magadha forever for you.
But before that I want to know
if your powers are
just as good as they were.
I, Amatya Rakshas, call you.
An invisible human whose speed
and sound no one can estimate.
Bhukal..
The second one
Bhadrakal.
whose aim is perfect.
He makes anything his weapon.
He uses it as a weapon.
The third..
Avkal, he is a weapon himself.
His weapons are poisonous, sharp.
They pierce through
the hardest metals.
All three of you are not
just brothers but a form of Kaal.
You are Trikal.
I am happy
that the speciality
of your personalities
are still intact.
Your target is Vishnugupta
Chanakya's death.
There is only one way to reach him.
Chandragupta himself.
There is some connection
between Chanakya and Chandragupta.
You just have to follow Chandragupta.
You will find Chanakya automatically.
I had told you
that he will definitely find Chanakya.
He will definitely
complete his challenge.
I wish I could stop him.
Brother must be more proud of him now.
He is interested in everything
else apart from being my bodyguard.
Princess, shall I ask the king to
appoint some other bodyguard for you?
Why do you always talk negative?
I will not let him go very easily.
He will have to fulfill
his responsibility.
Help!
- Is anybody there? Help!
- Help!
Do not come closer.
Servant. Is anybody there? Help!
What happened, Princess?
Servant. Servant,
somebody has come to kill me.
Help me. Send him away.
Catch him. Servant, I am scared.
Princess, how can I catch
him if you do not leave me?
Yes. Go and do your duty.
- Go, catch him.
- Okay.
Where is the chit?
Let us go.
Okay. Hit on my face and run away.
The princess must be coming.
Oh, God! Servant.
Princess.
Hey!
Who was he and what is all this?
Princess, we will have
to inform the king immediately.
I am your culprit.
I have disappointed you.
You have always supported me.
You never betrayed me and I..
I failed in giving Chanakya's
chopped head to you.
Sorry.
Forgive me.
Brother.
Brother, somebody had entered my room.
I think..
I think he wanted to kill me.
It is good that the servant was there.
Otherwise,
I do not know what he would do to me.
Who was he?
I hope you have killed me.
No, Your Majesty.
Because we cannot find the
real culprit if we kill the intruder.
What are you trying to say?
Your Majesty, he was not an intruder.
He was an informer.
And I got something from
him that will leave you shocked.
You will be surprised, Your Majesty.
What are you trying to say?
Look at this, Your Majesty.
There are 12.5 alphabets
on these chits.
And when I joined these 12.5 alphabets
I found this message.
The hidden treasure has been found.
Hidden treasure?
I think your behaviour
has become like mine
by staying with me.
Today..
Somebody told me today itself
that I suspect a lot.
I do not trust the people around me.
Is the same thing
happening to you too?
My treasure is safe.
Nobody can find my treasure
because my treasure
is an unsolvable riddle.
And even if anybody reaches there
my treasure is hidden
by those unsolvable riddles
that nobody will be able to steal it.
Gold does not lose its value
even if it is on the ground.
Why?
Because its value
is not defined based
on its exterior form.
It is based on the nature of the metal
which it is made up from.
Similarly, not a person's conditions
but his nature is his real treasure.
So, learn to identify gold.
Otherwise, you may look away from it
since it is lying on the soil
and somebody else may get hold of it
and its power may become his treasure.
The teachings are mine
and the destiny is yours.
This riddle is the last chance
of stealing Dhananand's treasure.
'Finger in the eye.
Fire in the mouth.'
'A knife to the stomach.
It awakens your fortune.'
'A hand inside the burrow.'
'May it be a matter
of one and a half seconds.'

================================================================================

Episode: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Cf9OOnKBvc

My secret treasure is completely safe.
Nobody can find it.
Because it is a mystery.
My treasure is blended
with such a difficult riddle
that even if someone finds it
they cannot steal it ever.
- But, Brother..
- My dear sister..
Go, get some rest.
And you, servant
it is your duty to
safeguard my sister.
If you find an intruder again
kill him right there.
Sure, Your Majesty.
Please come, my Lady.
Someone knows where
my secret treasure is.
But who is it?
'Acharya said that Dhananand
himself would tell me'
'where he has hidden his treasure.'
'But he did not.'
'He is sure that
his treasure is safe.'
All you guards must be very vigilant.
And both of you
call some more soldiers
from our cantonments.
I want every corner of the
palace to be three times more secure.
Tighten the security
arrangements in the garden
junctions, main entrance
and in every corner of the palace.
Seal the whole palace. Go.
Oh..
Bhadrasaal, what is going on?
We are fulfilling the
command of the emperor.
Go.
This king is very strange.
He can pass any order at any time.
'You just have to spy on Chandragupta'
'and you will find Chanakya.'
These are the three
soldiers of our army
who had received the news
of theft of your secret wealth.
And in lieu of money they were going
to give this news to someone else.
At your order all three of them
have been killed
by giving them posion.
Bhadrasaal, you killed them.
But those who want to use that
information against me are still alive.
They are our actual enemies.
King Seleucus is arriving!
Accept my greetings,
the emperor of Magadha.
I heard that somebody
tried to steal your treasure.
Someone tried. People keep trying.
But the truth is
nobody can steal it ever.
I am sure you have not come here
to tell me about those
unsuccessful attempts.
- Am I right?
- You are right, Your Majesty.
Why would I talk about
that and hurt you more?
I am here with the proposal
of my friendship.
You are worried about
the safety of your treasure.
It is better you focus on
the internal matters of your kingdom.
Until then, I will make the strategy
of invading 16 kingdoms of India.
Oh!
I mean, 15 kingdoms.
The 16th one is Magadha
which belongs to my best friend.
I am extremely happy with this offer.
But your information in not complete.
Someone wants to steal the
wealth of Dhananand and make him weak.
But the truth is,
I have so much of wealth
that I can have any woman
in this world for my pleasure.
For example
your beautiful daughter, Helena.
- Emperor Dhananand!
- Oh..
Getting angry after hearing the
truth does not suit the brave ones.
I was just telling
you what the reality is.
But I am sure you did not like this.
- Bhadrasaal.
- Yes, Your Majesty?
Is this the culture of Magadha?
He is our guest.
He should not face any inconvenience.
Go, Seleucus
enjoy the hospitality
of Magadha once more.
Your master plan according to which
Dhananand himself would
have told us about his treasure
has now failed.
No.
My plan did not fail.
Really? And how?
Due to that attempt of thievery
Dhananand must have kept his secret
treasure extremely close to him.
And you just told me
that after reading those few words
Dhananand has tightened the
security of the palace by three times.
That means,
the treasure is inside the palace.
So, Acharya
this will create more problems for us.
Even if we find the secret
treasure in the palace
how will we steal it?
With the help of the
clue which Dhananand gave us.
You will have to solve
a very difficult riddle.
Just like how you
solved one while entering
the palace of Piplivan.
'A wanderer stuck between
morning and evening.'
'Someone who has been
walking for one month.'
Oh! That one?
I could solve it because
I read it in a book.
A book helped us back then
and now the one who is an expert
in crafting such riddles will help us.
He is the one and the only.
Are you talking about
that great riddle maker?
Yes.
Kings used to hire that riddle maker
to hide their secret treasure
or to make secret
chambers in the palace.
It is because of that riddle maker
that the secrets
of many royal families
remained mysteries for ages.
If Dhananand's secret
treasure is in his palace
I am sure that its
access has been blended
with a riddle of that riddle maker.
Do you mean to say
that the same
riddle maker is still alive?
Yes, I am sure he is.
Because a cruel ruler like Dhananand
will not let go such a talented person.
Going by Dhananand's cruel nature
I can say that he must have made sure
that this riddle maker
lives an awful life.
He must be alive
but he must have
lost the hope to live.
After the destruction of Piplivan
nobody saw or heard
about that riddle maker.
But now, you will have to find him,
Chandragupta.
Because we can reach
the treasure of Dhananand
only with the help
of that riddle maker.
Acharya, if that riddle maker
is related to Piplivan
I am sure
that mother knows something about him.
No doubt.
Yes.
So I will ask her about him tomorrow.
And I..
Acharya,
I am telling you about everything
and you are going into meditation?
Acharya!
Acharya, are you listening to me?
I have never seen a heartless,
stubborn, cruel
and weird person like
you who annoys me so much!
Leave me alone.
The wait is now over.
Get ready.
'Chandragupta,
the dominating side in a war'
'is the one who can anticipate
the next move of their enemies.'
'Understand the
pattern of the attack.'
'Observe it.'
'And stay alert for the next move.'
Counter attack.
'Keep that in mind.
Each of your senses is so powerful'
'that when required'
'only one of your senses
is enough to win you a war.'
'But for that you need to
calm your mind and concentrate.'
So finally you have opened your eyes.
You need a lot more practice.
If you were a bit more
attentive during the training
then you would not have been wounded.
The bloodshed went in vain.
In vain?
You could have died, Acharya.
It is good
that I got the impression
that someone was following me.
That is when I understood
if they did not attack me
then their target is someone else.
That is why I pretended
to take this path.
But I stayed here and saved your life.
Anyway it is impossible
that you will be thankful to me.
Just tell me, who were they?
Trikaal.
The three brothers.
They are latent
who kill for money.
But no normal human
being can reach them.
There is only one person
who could have sent them to kill me.
I need to take care of it by myself.
But he is now aware of the fact
that you are
to me.
Are you amazed to see
all your efforts going in vain?
In case the plan of my execution
comes on your mind again
do have the courage
to come on your own.
But it is worthless to expect
such deeds of bravado from you.
It is because of you
and that slave Chandragupta
I have lost all honour
and respect that I had.
Your honour and respect were gone
the day you accepted to
serve that lowly, cruel Dhananand.
Dhananand just showed
you a glimpse of it. -
Vishnugupta.
Moreover, I did not come
here to tell you about your errors.
I have come here to
shatter your illusion.
Did you think that slave
found me with his effort?
No, Amatya Rakshas.
I wanted that obsequious
slave of Dhananand reach me.
That is why I threw a bait at him
and then he came to me.
Do you know why?
That is because I want to convey
a message to the Emperor through you
that I am adamant
with the vow which I took
and I will make sure to complete it.
Very soon I will
create a deceptive trap
which will bring an
end to the nefarious ruling
of Dhananand to an end!
"He is Chanakya!"
"He is Chanakya!"
It is necessary for
our plan to succeed, Mother.
Only you can help me in doing it.
Dhananand had made that
riddle maker captive here.
Before someone suspects us,
please tell us.
That person was none other
than the great architect Tithiraj.
After the attack on Piplivan
he was brought along
with me to Magadha.
As far as I know, after that
Dhananand had banned
entry for everybody
inside the palace for three months.
Maybe he was chalking
out some secret plan.
Maybe a secret path
or a secret tunnel.
And then..
After three months,
what became of him, Mother?
The inevitable happened.
In front of the cruel Dhananand,
even Tithiraj met the same fate
just like other artisans.
After getting his secret
place made from that artist
Dhananand chopped off his hands.
Even his tongue was cut off.
So that he could not
create a new riddle in future.
And he could not tell anyone
about his last created riddle.
Where is that riddle maker now?
He is here.
Somewhere in this palace,
he has been made captive.
But nobody knows where.
This palace is massive.
If Tithiraj is held
captive in this palace
then it will be like finding
a needle in a haystack.
But I will make sure to find Tithiraj
so that I can find
the wealth of Dhananand.
Do you see this cotton?
Sometimes it becomes
the source of light for the lamp.
Sometimes it is woven
into a robe for somebody.
Sometimes it becomes
the tail of an arrow
and makes the arrow reach its mark.
Sometimes it shields you
from the biting cold in the winter.
That is because the cotton
accepts all challenges.
The same way in life
a person who accepts challenges
in all the adverse
conditions which comes to him
he definitely reaches
the heights of success
he also makes others benefit
by his challenging ways.
So never be afraid of challenges.
Face them.
These are my principles.
Make the right choice.
This riddle is the last chance
of stealing Dhananand's treasure.
'Finger in the eye.
Fire in the mouth.'
'A knife to the stomach.
It awakens your fortune.'
'A hand inside the burrow.'
'May it be a matter
of one and a half seconds.'

================================================================================

Episode: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMgnJPflcnc

Where is that riddle maker now?
He is here.
He has been confined
in this very palace.
But nobody knows where he is locked.
If Tithiraj has been
confined in this palace
it will be very difficult
for us to find him.
Stul, how can you feel
like eating even after hearing
the riddle maker's tragic story?
Forgive me.
But as you know
I feel very hungry when I get sad.
Indeed!
Hunger! Food!
If the riddle maker has
been confined in this palace
I am sure they even serve him food.
- From the royal kitchen!
- From the royal kitchen!
Yes, you are right.
Now listen to the plan.
'Stul will watch the royal kitchen
during the lunch time.'
'Someone will surely come there
to take food for the riddle maker.'
It's been so many years, Daima.
He stinks of rotten food now.
I do not know why
we have confined him.
Even you did not mend
your ways in all these years.
You ask me the same question
and make me furious.
Your job is to obey orders
and not to ask questions!
Get lost!
Okay, Daima.
What are you doing here, servant?
Forgive me, Daima. Forgive me.
I was just..
Do not give me any excuses!
What were you doing in
the kitchen during the time
when nobody is allowed in here?
Nothing, Daima.
Tell me what your plan is!
I wanted to steal
a 'Laddu' from the kitchen.
Henceforth,
you will think a hundred times
- before stealing anything!
- Yes.
Remember this!
Chandragupta and you
are mere servants of this palace
and are not allowed
to walk freely around here.
Remember this!
Where are you going?
I was not going anywhere.
I was just enjoying
the beauty of this palace.
You are not paid wages
to enjoy the palace.
You have been appointed
as my bodyguard. Understood?
Princess, I have already told you
that I need not be with
you in order to protect you.
You must have forgotten
that after that spy's attack
the king has asked you
to take special care of me.
Do you remember that?
So, henceforth, I will decide
when and where you can go.
And it is time for my dance practice.
Come along with me.
'I must get rid of this
arrogant princess soon'
'and come back here.'
Come, servant.
Minister, how are you even alive?
I do not understand, Your Highness.
As of late,
you are being humiliated by me
and by that servant and by Chanakya,
sometimes.
How are you still able to live on?
I mean, how are you tolerating this?
I am merely focusing
on solving the problem.
And what is the problem as per you?
Do not mind me saying this but it
is something you do not want to hear.
So, I better remain silent.
However, Your Majesty
I will come to you
very soon with evidence.
I understood.
You are still targeting
that servant of mine.
Whereas, he is the one
who took us to Chanakya.
In fact, he had almost
helped us catch Chanakya.
That is what seems
all the more suspicious.
When the whole army of Magadha and
I could not find that clever Chanakya
that servant found him in just a day!
Think over this.
And do not forget that dream,
Your Highness.
You had a dream where
he was cutting your nose.
Expecting dreams
to turn into realities
is mere foolishness.
Dreams give us signs.
Rather than understanding the dreams,
themselves
one must understand
the signs they are sending.
But you are merely after that slave.
Hence, you use the dream as an excuse
and malign his image before me.
This is the last
thing I wanted to see.
The scholarly and genius Amatya
is using a dream instead
of his knowledge to create history.
Great!
Amatya Rakshas, your intelligence
has been reduced to nothing.
Absolutely nothing.
But Your Majesty,
I was trying to say..
Enough!
I should consult someone else now.
Since you are blinded
by your hatred for that slave.
I will come to you next for advice
only when your delusions
are cleared away.
Dhananand has made a huge mistake
by uttering my daughter
Helena's name with his foul mouth!
Now he must pay for this!
Previously,
I was going to invade Magadha
after acquiring the 15 kingdoms.
But now..
Now Magadha will be my first target.
Dhananand is fond of beautiful girls,
isn't he?
You will go to his palace now.
Now you will become
Dhananand's favoured mistress
and my eyes inside the palace
and give me information
about every move
that Dhanand makes.
Understood?
'I had seen that soldier
take this very path.'
There is no one here.
Because of that arrogant princess
I missed this chance!
Enough, my friend. I am full.
Do you think I'm a fool
to believe that you are full so soon?
Friend, I am making amends.
Let me do it.
Let me feed you three whole Rotis.
But you are not at fault for this.
If anyone is at fault
it is Daima.
I have to teach her a lesson.
That is what she wants.
She is using me to get to you.
So, do not be impulsive
and give her the opportunity
that she is waiting for, Chandra.
But my friend, she scalded your hands.
She did not scald my hands.
She made me feel fortunate.
The future emperor of sovereign India
fed me food with his own hands.
It is no small matter.
If that Princess Durdhara
had not crossed my path
I would have found that riddle maker.
Every lock has a key.
For every problem there is a solution.
One just needs to
scrutinise it vigilant.
Tell me, Acharya
what is the solution
to find riddle maker?
Come with me.
Acharya, I thought you would show us
the way to the riddle maker.
But you have brought
us to this forest.
Cut this shrub.
Acharya, how is this plant
connected to the riddle maker?
Do as I say. Cut this shrub.
Sure.
Amazing!
Acharya, what plant is this?
It is not important
what plant this is.
It is important what the plant can do.
The specialty of the plant's sap is
it seems like a clear
liquid during daytime
But in the dark of the night
when there is no fire or illumination
this begins to glow.
So, through this
sap I can find that path
which that soldier uses
to take food for that riddle maker.
Dhumketu,
now listen as to what you must do.
'When that soldier returns'
'to the royal kitchen to
take food for that riddle maker'
'you must discreetly smear this sap'
'on the soles of his shoes.'
'And then,
the traces of his footsteps'
'will lead me to the riddle maker.'
'I must erase these traces.'
'Or else, if anyone sees them'
'they will grow suspicious.'
'Why did the footsteps
vanish after this?'
'Surely there is
a secret door over here.'
'Your plan is working as expected,
Acharya.'
Where did the trail of
footsteps end at this point?
'How do I find the riddle maker now?'
Where did he disappear again?
How do I find the riddle maker
amidst such darkness?
'The specialty of
the sap of this shrub is'
'it seems like a clear
liquid in daylight'
'but in the dark of the night'
'when there is
no fire or illumination'
'this begins to glow.'
'After getting his secret
place made from that artist'
'Dhananand chopped off his hands.'
'Even his tongue was cut off.'
Do not be scared!
I am not your enemy, but a friend.
I need your help to slay Dhananand.
I am the son of Emperor
Chandravardhan Maurya and Queen Mura.
I am Chandragupta Maurya,
the prince of Piplivan.
A pitcher has a specialty.
It can quench anyone's thirst
with the cool water inside it.
However, if there is
even a small hole in it
it loses its importance.
Similarly,
those who bear great responsibilities
should be very cautious.
Because a single bad remark
against their conduct
can ruin their image forever.
Hence realise your shortcomings
and rectify them
before they destroy you.
The principles are mine.
But the fate is yours.
Only you can explain the unsolved
riddle under the protection of which
that evil Dhananand has hidden
his secret treasure in this palace.
What! Such insolence!

================================================================================

Episode: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plv9U6JwnNE

I want every information
about Seleucus.
When he wakes up, when he sleeps
what he eats,
where he goes, and who he meets..
I want all the information about him.
Send the most exceptional
and trustworthy spy over there.
I am feeling happy
by looking at something
other than wealth.
You are an amazing
and beautiful
creation of God.
Why are you standing there?
Come here.
Serve your king.
Samara has reached Dhananand's palace.
No matter whether
a man is rich or poor
once he is trapped
in the lust of women
he definitely gets destroyed.
And now, Samara will write the tale
of Dhananand's destruction
by giving me every information
related to him.
You were so beautiful!
You could have become
the dream of someone's life
but you died!
You could have filled
the life of any man with love!
But you have become
the reason for sorrow!
My friend, Seleucus!
How merciless
how harsh and how cruel
those people must be
who sent this beautiful lady
to this demon's den!
Why do the people
not understand that I..
I will kill every single enemy
who will eye Magadha
and its prosperity
with evil intentions!
What happened, friend?
Why are you shocked?
You are safe and you are my friend.
Why would you harbour evil
intentions against Magadha?
And what were you saying
about those 15 districts?
Yes! We will unite
and attack those 15 districts.
Then let us go.
Let us start the mission.
Do not worry, friend.
As long as you are my friend,
you are safe.
Lord Tithiraj, a revolt is
going to take place against Dhananand
on the next full moon.
And for the success of that revolt
we will have to steal
Dhananand's secret treasure
and create an army against him.
My mother had told me that only
you can explain the unsolved riddle
under the protection
of which that evil Dhananand
has hidden his secret treasure
in this palace.
What!
Such insolence!
Please tell me, Lord Tithiraj.
What is that riddle?
I know that the evil Dhananand
has taken both,
your voice and your hands
away from you.
But..
Perhaps, this can help you.
Please try.
B-But.. Please hurry up.
I do not have much time.
Hurry up!
'Finger in the eye..
Fire in the mouth.'
'A knife to the stomach..
It awakens your fortune.'
'During the cloudless rain,
may the eagle be with you.'
'A hand inside the burrow..'
'May it be a matter
of one and a half seconds.'
'Mahapadmanand.'
What does it mean?
Why have you written the word,
'Mahapadmanand'?
It is all right.
Please do not worry.
I will solve this riddle.
I give you my word
that I will definitely exact
your revenge against Dhananand.
Hey!
Your Highness?
It seems like your consciousness
is approaching its end.
You did not even touch
the food the entire day
but you are still smiling. All right.
Fill your stomach with
this smile until tomorrow.
All these soldiers are scared of you,
Amatya Rakshas.
That is why they are losing.
Come, fight with me.
Practice with me.
It seems as if I am
trying to kill you.
This thought had arisen in my mind.
Not only did you fail
in bringing Chanakya here
but you also broke
the rule made by me.
To kill Chanakya
you chose Trikaal.
The one whom I had banned.
Why?
Why, Amatya Rakshas?
You know
that I have never
doubted your loyalty.
But your disregard for my orders
is intolerable to me.
The problem is severe, Your Highness.
Chanakya has killed Trikaal as well.
I disregarded your order.
Please forgive me.
Forgiveness..
Chanakya is proving repeatedly
that he can challenge
me in multiple fields.
And you are proving to
be useless with every step.
Stay here
and practice.
Your Highness, I will..
As far as Chanakya is considered
my sixth sense is telling
me something else.
The things that are happening outside
are illusions.
The real game
is being played inside the palace.
I have to find out what that is.
I will have to take this
riddle to the Acharya soon.
Only he can help me in solving it.
Why are you in a hurry?
Please forgive me, Your Highness!
I was not paying attention.
Please forgive me.
Stop!
What are you hiding in your hand?
Show it to me.
You know it very well
that I am omniscient.
Do you not?
So, what secret are you hiding
in your hands? Bring it here!
What is this?
'If the king sees that riddle'
'then he will kill you, Chandra.'
Why are you roaming
around with a blank page?
A-Actually, Your Highness
I wanted to write my feelings
on this blank page.
But I was unable
to find the right words.
So, my dear cockroach
has been mesmerised
by someone's beauty!
Y-Yes, Your Highness.
Now, how can I hide anything from you?
You are omniscient.
Your Highness, this is true that
a beautiful girl
has stolen my heart.
Great! This is amazing!
This is the age of falling in love.
Pour your feelings out on this page.
And let me know the girl's answer.
Of course, Your Highness.
Oh!
Oh! I was saved.
Chandra, this page is blank.
You were going to write
the riddle on it, were you not?
- What happened?
- The riddle is written on it
but not using the normal ink.
I used the juice of that special plant
that disappears in the light
and glows only in the dark.
'Finger in the eye..'
'Fire in the mouth..'
'A knife to the stomach..'
'It awakens your fortune.'
'During the cloudless rain'
'may the eagle be with you.'
'A hand inside the burrow..'
'May it be a matter
of one and a half seconds.'
'Mahapadmanand.'
Oh, Lord! Is it a riddle or an epic?
- It is so long!
- But, Acharya
what does it mean?
I heard that you were smiling a lot.
Your happiness
makes me anxious.
I feel like snatching away your smile
and your life.
But if I do that, people would say
that I killed a great artist
just because he was smiling.
No.. No..
So, I will tell you a story today.
A story that only my
seven brothers and I know.
This is a mixture of
two riddles and not one.
Look at these pointer symbols.
Both the symbols are
opposite to each other.
It means
one riddle can take us
to that secret treasure
and the other riddle will
bring us out of that place.
What does the word
'Mahapadmanand' mean?
Today
on the death anniversary of my father,
the great king, Mahapadmanand
I will tell you
the secret of his death.
Everyone thinks
that my father died in my arms.
But the truth
is that I strangled him to death.
What could I have done?
Old age and diseases
had addled his brain.
He wanted me to share my money,
my property
and my kingdom with my brothers.
'Forgive me, Father.'
'You made me the king.'
'You told me that a king
has to be autocratic'
'and cruel regarding his decisions.'
'I have to be cruel with my brothers
if I have to remain a king.'
'Before that with you..'
'Is there anyone here
who wants to challenge me?'
'Does anyone want to lay
a claim on the throne of Magadha?'
'Is there anyone?'
So, now when you know the secret
that no one other than
my brothers and me knows
then this reason
is enough to kill you.
Soldiers!
He has solved many riddles.
Now, kill him in cold blood.
Bury him in a secret place.
Even death's messengers
should not find
the great riddler's body
whose soul they want to reap.
Take him away!
The signs given to you
by the riddle maker, Tithiraj
indicate that a statue
of the late king, Mahapadmanand
is situated in Dhananand's palace.
I am sure
that the way to reach
this secret treasure
is related to that statue.
Even if such a statue exists
then only the royal family
can reach it.
How can I go there?
Only you can go there, Chandragupta.
Do not forget
that you are Princess Durdhara's
main bodyguard.
Tomorrow is the death anniversary
of the late king, Mahapadmanand.
Using Princess Durdhara as the medium
you will reach that statue.
But remember, Chandragupta
that you will just have tomorrow.
Because after tomorrow
that statue will be
closed again for a year.
So, if you fail tomorrow
then it may become impossible
to rob Dhananand's secret treasure.
When we face a problem in life
until we remain within it
we will keep getting trapped in it.
We can find the solution
only by going away from the problem
and thinking about it.
My ethics..
Your destiny.
By stealing Dhananand's
secret treasure tonight
the first step of our
revolt will be successful.
'Finger in the eye..
Fire in the mouth..'
'A knife to the stomach..
It awakens your fortune.'
'A hand inside the burrow..'
'May it be a matter
of one and a half seconds.'

================================================================================

Episode: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YchqEoULwnM

'Tomorrow is the death anniversary
of the former king, Mahapadmanand.'
'And you will find that statue
using Princess Durdhara.'
'Chandra, you have only today.'
'Very quickly, I have to
reach King Mahapadmanand's statue.'
'And I have to manipulate
this arrogant princess to do that.'
Your bodyguard is at your service,
Princess.
Servant, leave me alone today.
Go from here.
'She always forces
me to walk as her shadow.'
'Today, when I myself
want to be with her'
'so that my plan can succeed,
she is asking me to go away.'
'I will have to do something.'
You are still here?
I told you, leave.
Are you worried, Princess?
Your worry is my worry, Princess.
Tell me, what can I do
to bring that lovely
smile on your face again?
Servant,
today is not the day to smile.
It is my father, King Mahapadmanand's
death anniversary today.
Did you love him a lot?
Why should I tell you this?
Okay, do not tell me.
Stop!
Father loved me a lot.
I was his favourite child.
And why not?
I was his only daughter
among eight brothers.
He loved me more than his life.
Princess, you are very lucky.
Lucky?
Are you mocking me, Servant?
May God not let anybody be mocked
in such matters.
You are lucky,
because you have your father
and some of his memories.
I do not have even that.
any moment spent with my father.
I do not remember
How did he die?
Your father?
I just remember
that he died
for his honour and pride.
And how did your father die?
I do not know.
Only my brother was
with him at that moment.
But I am happy
that he was in the arms of my brother,
King Dhananand during his last moments.
'Chandra, it is not easy to reach this
statue amidst such tight security.'
'One mistake and I will be dead.'
No.
I cannot go inside.
Whenever I see his statue, I realise
that I have lost him forever.
No.
'Remember one thing, Chandragupta.'
'You have only tomorrow's day'
'because that statue will be locked
again' 'for one year after tomorrow.'
'So, Chandragupta,
if you miss tomorrow'
'it might become impossible
to steal Dhananand's hidden treasure.'
'Forgive me.'
'It pains me to take advantage
of somebody's emotions.'
'But I have to do this.'
Princess.
I know what you are
going through right now.
But this is the moment
when you should thank him
for all the beautiful
memories of the past
which made your present
and future bright.
You should go near his statue and pray
so that his soul can
attain peace and joy.
Servant, you are right.
I have come here on your request.
You come with me too.
Let him come.
'Finger in the eye,
fire in the mouth.'
'This riddle may
have a literal meaning.'
'I will have to go
closer to this statue.'
Princess,
I had heard from some priests
that if we close our eyes and
recite the Gayatri mantra 11 times
our prayer reaches the dead ones.
And their soul will rest in peace.
Is this true?
Will the chants of
my mantras reach my father?
I am not completely sure.
But there is no harm in trying.
Right?
- "Hail.."
- Not like this, Princess.
Close your eyes
and remember your father.
Bring his image in front of your eyes
and offer your mantras to him.
Until you chant the mantra 11 times
and the veneration is complete
do not open your eyes.
Okay.
[Sanskrit shlok]
'Forgive me, Princess.'
'This is the first time'
'I have seen a different
side of your personality.'
'Unwillingly,
I have to take advantage of this.'
Finger in the eyes.
Fire in the mouth.
Princess, my father's memories
have surrounded me
after seeing your love and
dedication towards your father.
Forgive me, Princess.
But I will have to go now.
But you keep your eyes closed
and continue to chant the mantras
for 11 times.
Servant.
He actually left.
I think he was also
missing his father.
What happened, Brother?
Why did you call
me here all of a sudden?
Is everything all right?
Oh, God!
This is Dhananand's room.
What have I got myself into?
Brother, did you see that?
The curtain was moving.
No.
What happened, Brother?
Brother
what has happened
in the last couple of days
has made me anxious.
That attack on Durdhara..
'Brother,
there was someone in my room.'
'He.. He might've
been here to kill me!'
And then
that attempt to steal
my secret treasure.
And Chanakya slipping away
when we had almost caught him.
'Chanakya tricked Amatya's
soldiers and ran away.'
Could all of this be happening
because of father's curse?
I had killed him
with these very hands.
Could this be the punishment for that?
'I am happy that he was in my brother'
'King Dhananand's arms during
the last moments of his life.'
No, Brother.
You were the favourite son of father.
He could never curse you.
Brother, that is why you
could never become the emperor.
A father might not curse his son
but an emperor never forgives the one
who usurps his throne.
Now take me for example..
when he tried to take away my throne.
I killed father
But I spared my brothers.
Do you know why?
Because none of my
brothers have the courage
to go against me
the way I went
against our father the great emperor,
Mahapadmanand.
But your lives are safe
as long as our sister
is ignorant of this truth.
The day Durdhara finds out
that I was the one
who killed our father
you will lose your life.
Not at all.
None of us will ever do that, Brother.
Rest assured.
'Dhananand is so cruel.'
'He killed his own
father for the throne.'
Come.
Let us drink together today.
Also, let us remember our father.
Come.
Where do I go now?
Dhananand left his razor here.
He does not go anywhere without it.
Brother
I forgot my favourite
razor in the room.
Go ahead, I will be there.
I must find a way to get out of here.
'Finger in the eyes,
fire in the mouth'
'a knife in the stomach..'
Will turn your fortunes.
Could it be referring
the stomach of this idol?
Knife in the stomach.
Sometimes a simple effort is enough
to solve the most difficult mysteries.
Now take this cloth for example.
Just pulling a small thread
can unravel it completely.
Similarly, to destroy
an impregnable palace
having the knowledge
of its one weak brick is enough.
My strategies, your destiny.
Bring the secret
treasure from the palace.
There is only one key to get success.
Keep moving ahead
fearlessly without stopping.
By stealing Dhananand's
secret treasure tonight
the first step of our
revolt will be successful.

Episode: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M71Knl_Lskk

Why do I feel that someone was here?
I think
that I am being too suspicious.
If all these things are here
then they must be
here to show the path.
So much of gold!
How will I take all
this away from here!
And I do not see any
path to get out of here.
'Look at these directions.'
'Both are pointed in
the opposite directions.'
'This means'
'one puzzle can take
us to the secret treasure'
'and the other puzzle will
show the path to get out of there.'
'It should rain without clouds.'
The eagle should be with you.
That means.. I got it.
I found the path.
Wonderful, Dhananand.
Only you can create
such a difficult puzzle.
But now that I have solved this puzzle
then I will loot your
treasure and take away soon.
Ten steps ahead, from here till there
and there is a tunnel
in which there are many stairs.
And it is connected
to Dhananand's room.
And then the secret treasure..
Then that locker
which contains a lot of things.
A lot of things!
And then the water and the wall.
Then suddenly,
that hill, open air and open sky!
And then this..
What is all this?
Relax. Take a deep breath.
Now, just focus and tell me.
What did you see?
Towards the North-east,
on the other side of the hills
ten steps ahead, there is a
door to get out of that secret place.
And that path is very dangerous.
And it will become even more difficult
to take the treasure away from there.
That is why we will do
the task in two different teams.
You will be in one team
and will bring the secret
treasure from the palace.
And Sthul, Dhoom and Indra
will wait for you outside
the door near that hill.
So that the treasure
stolen from Dhananand
can be taken out without wasting time.
Okay.
If we work hard for one week
then we will definitely
be able to steal the treasure.
We do not have one week's time,
Chandragupta!
I have already told you.
After tonight,
Dhananand will close the statue
of Mahapadmanand for one year.
And then after that,
he will open it only after one year.
Whatever it is,
we have to do it by tonight.
No matter what the situation is
you have to steal Dhananand's
secret treasure by tonight.
But we are not ready to
complete such a tough mission.
How can we steal so
much treasure by tonight?
If you keep thinking
about the problems
then you will get trapped inside it,
Chandragupta.
You will not find a solution.
Remember.
There is only one key to get success.
Keep moving ahead
fearlessly without stopping.
The responsibility of
bringing these three boys
to the door near the hill is mine.
You just go to the palace right now.
Go and work on your plan.
Fast!
Right.
Let us begin
the end of Dhananand.
By stealing Dhananand's
secret treasure tonight
the first step of our
revolt will be successful.
'It is not possible to
reach cave from the secret path'
'that goes through Dhananand's room'
'because outside his room,
the security is very tight.'
'That is why I have to
take the path of Mahapadmanand.'
'And to reach there again'
'the most important
key of my plan will be'
'Princess Durdhara.'
'First of all, I will make sure'
'that Princess Durdhara
is in Shipra's room with her'
'and not in her own room.'
'And then I will start the second
step of my plan with mother's help.'
Somebody, please help!
Princess Durdhara's room is on fire!
'By distracting
everyone with this fire'
'I'll head towards
Mahapadmanand's idol.'
Run, Princess Durdhara's
room is on fire.
Go. Go fast.
Go and bring some sand. Go.
Rush. Go.
Go guys.
'Princess Durdhara's protection'
'is far more important
to the king than his own life.'
'That is why he'll go there
himself to check on the princess.'
'And with that it'll be
easy for me to enter his room.'
Where is this smoke coming from?
Princess Durdhara's room is on fire.
Extinguish the fire. Fast.
Fire in Durdhara's room!
Go. Go.
'Everyone in the palace is
trying to protect princess Durdhara.'
'But what about Amatya Rakshas?'
'He is nowhere to be seen.'
Run, Princess Durdhara's
room is on fire.
Go. Go, fast..
You two stay alert
to protect this place.
And close the door. Fast.
'The room with Mahapadmanand's
idol is empty now.'
'The only thing left,
is to get rid these soldiers.'
What are you guys doing here?
Didn't you hear that the
princess's room is on fire?
Come, we need to save
her and bring her out.
- Let's go.
- No we can't go there.
We have the orders from the king.
That we will have to protect
this room with our lives.
Are you guys denying a
soldier from the special team?
Are you guys stupid?
This is only the idol
of the king's greatness.
But the king's sister's
life is on the line there.
Think.
If he comes to know
that though you were aware
that the princess was in danger
you stayed here to guard
the idol of the king's greatness
think, what will happen to you guys.
You guys stay back,
I am going to save her.
Wait. We will join you as well.
Do not stop. Keep going.
I will be right behind.
'The first step to achieve
Dhananand's wealth is complete.'
'No one can stop me
now from reaching my goal.'
Durdhara!
- Durdhara!
- Brother.
- Are you all right?
- Yes, Brother.
I was not in my room
when the fire broke out.
I was in Shipra's room.
But what caused this fire?
It's such
that the curtains
of her room caught fire.
Listen to me.
Yes, sir.
You were assigned to protect
King Padmanand's idol, weren't you?
What are you guys
doing here in that case?
We were going to save the princess
her room is on fire.
A soldier told us that
our presence is required there.
Okay, go.
Who can it be?
This dress is slowing me down.
I think I have to get rid of it.
'The bird of Jove is with you.
Your hand is in the hole.'
'It is a matter of
one and half 'Ghadi'.'
What does one and half 'Ghadi' mean?
Maybe I have not yet understood
this part of the puzzle.
Finger in the eyes.
Fire in the mouth.
I have to inform the king about it.
Sire.
This dress.
I found it in the chamber
of the late king Mahapadmanand.
But no one has the permission
to go into that room.
Where were the soldiers
guarding that room?
Maybe one of them went inside.
Forgive us, Sire. We are here.
One soldier came and
told us that we are needed
for the safety of the princess.
That means
this fire did not start on its own
someone started it.
So that they could
distract me and..
'Hurry up, Chandra.'
'Dhananand is coming towards you.'
'Knife in the stomach
will turn your fortunes.'
There is definitely
a thief in my chamber.
Break it down!
Wonderful! You did it, friend.
This is not the time to celebrate.
Dhananand could come here any moment.
We have to hurry up. And..
What is it, Chandra?
Why have you fallen
silent all of a sudden?
Everything is done
but I have not yet solved
the last part of the puzzle.
'It is a matter of
one and half 'Ghadi'.'
What could this mean?
Let us solve all
the problems one by one.
First of all, we need to
load this treasure on those chariots
before that cruel king
Dhananand comes here.
- Okay.
- I am sure, friend
that you will soon find the
answer to the last part of the puzzle.
Come, let us load this
treasure on the chariots.
Okay.
Why are you standing
there like statues?
Go!
'It is a matter of
one and half 'Ghadi'.'
'What does it mean?'
'I am missing something.'
Move aside!
That thief took my knife with
him so that I could not reach him.
That means he has solved the puzzle.
That thief is stealing
Dhananand's treasure!
'It is a matter of
one and half 'Ghadi'.'
That means..
Oh, my God!
It was an indicator of time.
That means this door
closes in 36 minutes.
Hurry up, friends.
We do not have much time.
Friend, leave that.
This door is closing. Come quickly.
No! We have come so far so
we will take everything with us.
I will not leave a single coin behind,
let alone a box!
I will take everything
of that Dhananand from here!
M-My treasure!
My..
Do you see these gold coins?
If I keep collecting them
and put one on top of the other
they will stay stable for a time
but after a while
they will not be able
to support their own weight
and crash.
The same way
when greed gets out of control
it makes a person's base unstable.
It births imbalance.
Be it the greed of money,
happiness and comfort
or of respect and reputation.
Whenever it gets out of limit
it disappoints us.
between greed and ambition.
That is why learn to differentiate
My ethics, your destiny.
'For a unanimous India master
Chanakaya put his life in danger.'
Stop, king.
If you kill him then you will
never be able to reach to your wealth.
'What will be the
result of this planning?'

================================================================================

Episode: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLcK8Q-Kino

M-My treasure!
My..
Run!
Hey!
He.. He will kill us!
Only if he can catch us.
You remember a thief is the one..
Who gets caught..
Faster, friends!
He is getting closer!
Is he a man or a demon!
Chandra, he is running
faster than the chariots.
Indra, have you brought
what I asked for?
Yes, it is in a bundle
on your chariot.
The three of you, go ahead.
I will stay here
and try to distract him.
- Okay. Let us go!
- Let us go..
We do not have much time.
Let us go!
Run! Faster!
This is the beginning of your end,
Dhananand.
Remember our last meeting.
That day, I was on the ground
and you were laughing.
'If you ever feel
like uniting India again'
'let this insult remind you
that I am the biggest obstacle'
'for your dream of united India.'
'Magadha is your obstacle,
not some foreigner!'
Today, you are on the ground.
You are on your knees in front of me.
You compared me to dirt.
Do you remember my reply?
'You have compared me to dirt.'
'I will raise a new emperor'
'from this very dirt!'
All of these events are the beginning
of the fulfillment of my vow, Dhananand!
And now also begins the journey
of you becoming a demon from a king.
by stealing your treasure, Dhananand.
I have made my first move against you
Be alert now
because you will be subjected
to many more such moves in the future.
And then slowly
your dark empire will end.
Only thing left will be
the remains of your empty ego.
"Chanakya.."
"Chanakya.."
"Chanakya.."
"Chanakya.."
Chanakya, I..
Chanakya!
"Chandragupta."
"He is a warrior. Chandragupta."
"His sight is as sharp
as a blade. Chandragupta."
"He is brave and patient.
He is the base of a race."
"He is logical and intelligent.
He has the magnificence of the sun."
"He is Chandragupta Maurya!"
"He is Chandragupta Maurya!"
I cannot believe we have
really stolen that
evil Dhananand's treasure.
Yes, we have stolen.
Now we just need to take
it somewhere secret and safe.
Let us go.
Stop!
Oh, God!
We got caught at the very end,
Chandra.
You have been caught.
I have recognised you, Acharya.
But I do not want any
of you to be recognised.
It is not advisable to
take the treasure out now.
All the doors of Magadha
would have been closed by now.
The security at the border
will be more tight now.
All the doors of Magadha
have been closed.
If anybody tries to go out of Magadha
he should be killed immediately.
So, it will be impossible to
take this treasure outside Magadha.
We will have to stay
here and make a plan.
But where will we take
this treasure by staying here?
- And how?
- I will plan something.
Now, all of you return
to the palace immediately.
Your absence there
can lead to suspicion.
- Go.
- Okay, Acharya.
Stulbhadra,
help me in hiding this treasure.
I am in trouble.
I will be sacrificed today.
Yes, Acharya.
We do not have time to waste now.
Dhananand will try his level
best to get this treasure back.
He must be planning something.
Future successors of the barbers
all of you will be
given an important lecture.
The advice given in today's class
will give you an important
guidance in your life.
The aim is not just to
cut this boy's entangled hair.
But we have to sort
his entangled hair.
Who will solve this puzzle?
'The chain of incidents
is the beginning'
'of the completion of my promise,
Dhananand.'
'And also begins the journey'
'of you becoming
a subject from a king.'
Great King Dhananand,
you and your ancestors
had been trained here how to cut hair.
Today, you have come
here with an intention
of solving some puzzles of your life.
Remember that you have to gain control
over yourself and your
mind before solving any problem.
So, when the mind is calm
the hands will start
doing its work on its own.
And the answers to your questions
will be right in front of you.
'Brother, did you see that?'
'The curtain was moving.'
'This outfit was found in
the late king, Padmanand's room.'
'A soldier came here and informed me'
'that I am required
here to guard the princess.'
'This means, the fire did
not break out but it was lit'
'so that he could distract me and..'
'I had got that puzzle
composed in a special way'
'that even if anybody solves it'
'he will have to go
through my personal room'
'if he has to steal the treasure'
'and that was impossible.'
'But this was still made possible.'
'only if the thief is helped
by somebody in the palace'
'who knows every route here.'
You have solved the problem,
Your Majesty.
Yes, Acharya.
If you go to your roots
the root of the problem
gets solved on its own.
I am very happy today, Your Majesty.
So happy that I could not stop myself
from coming here and thanking you.
Today, Dhananand's secret treasure
could be stolen with your help.
Just he took away my treasure
my family
and my kingdom, Piplivan, from me
somebody has taken away Dhananand's
favourite thing from him today.
His secret treasure.
Piplivan will always
be grateful to you for that.
Instead, I..
The one whom you have come to thank
has already gone
to God and thanked Him
for being relieved of
the pain that I gave him.
Now that I know
that even you were involved with
that riddle maker in this conspiracy
I will give you such a punishment
that history will remember it, Mura.
Six..
Chandra, looks like the king
is punishing someone.
That is why there is so much of crowd.
Come, let us see.
Five..
Mister, listen. What is going on here?
The king has caught the person
who helped Magadha's enemies
in stealing his treasure.
He is now going to
give a death sentence.
Four..
There are 298 coins in it
for these baskets and fruits.
But we had this deal for 300 coins.
Yes, I know.
But I have two coins less.
I will sell these fruits
and give you the two coins.
All right.
Thank you.
Acharya,
we have this heap of gold coins.
But you still paid
him two coins less. Why so?
Because I do not want
him to be suspicious about me.
These gold coins can
gain anybody's attention.
Put these baskets in the cart soon.
We have very less time.
But where will we
hide so much of wealth?
At a place that Dhananand
cannot even think of.
One!
- Zero!
- Your Highness, stop!
This maid has nothing to
do with the theft of your treasure.
But I am sure you are related to her.
I knew
that you will come.
I am sure you are related to her.
Yes, Your Highness.
It is the relation of
trust which is between us.
And I am sure
that this servant
does not have enough
courage and strength
to make such a big plan
of stealing your secret treasure.
Is it?
I heard her thanking that riddle maker
because of whom that
thief stole my treasure.
But this is obvious.
She will obviously thank someone
who goes against you or harms you.
If she comes to know
that I am killing you
she would thank even me. Right?
Do not trick me, servant.
I just do business.
If you want her to be alive
bring Chanakya before me.
My whole army is searching for him
but I am sure you can find him.
You have time till sunset.
You better bring him here.
Or else, I will surely give
you the chance to light her pyre.
This is my promise.
There is nothing bad in being a thorn.
But before we hurt someone,
we should know
whom we are hurting.
Such situations may
arise before humans too.
We can be enemies with anyone
but before attacking them,
make sure you gauge
how powerful he is than us.
Because, if the enemy
turns out to be more powerful
you will be destroyed.
Hence, until you do not
find the weakness of the enemy
it is better to let
him be your friend.
My strategies, your destiny.
'For a unanimous India master
Chanakya put his life in danger.'
Stop, king.
If you kill him then you will
never be able to reach to your wealth.
'What will be the
result of this planning?'

================================================================================

Episode: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDOfhj1dl7M

Chandra, what will you do now?
How will you save your mother?
I will find Chanakya.
Acharya!
Acharya!
- Acharya!
- What happened, Chandragupta?
Where is Acharya Chanakya, Bhairav?
He must be hiding
Dhananand's stolen treasure.
- But where?
- I do not know.
'You have the deadline
until the dusk today.'
'I will spare her if
you bring Chanakya here.'
'Or else, I will surely give
you the chance of lighting her pyre.'
Where would you hide
Dhananand's treasure?
Where are you, Acharya?
'We should always think
two steps ahead of our enemy.'
'By reading his mind
we can trick him.'
You must be in a place
where nobody can expect
that treasure and you to be.
Acharya,
will we hide the treasure here?
In the graveyard?
Stulbhadra, Dhananand's last rites
should be performed
along with this treasure.
So what could be
a better place to hide this
treasure than this graveyard?
Dhananand will leave no stone unturned
to find this treasure.
He can even get the
whole land of Magadha dug.
But he will not even imagine
that his stolen
treasure would be buried
in this graveyard.
So, hiding it here
is the best option.
I will not care even if you
have to dig up the whole Magadha
I just want my treasure. Go!
We have arranged the weapon
for Moora's execution, King.
Then what are you waiting for,
Bhadrasal?
Show it to me.
The liquid falling from this
pot will slowly burn this rope
and bring her closer to this dagger.
This rope will break
completely by the dusk
and that will be the end
of Moora's life, Your Highness.
Very good!
In fact, I should not have
let her be alive for all these days.
Acharya, we have dug up a sacred land
like graveyard to hide this treasure.
We have misused it.
Is it fair?
Stulbhadra,
this is a war against the evil.
And winning over the evil
is the only rule of such a war.
And this is possible only
when we uproot every hindrance.
Hail the Lord! Hail the Lord!
I have respect towards
those who are dead.
But they have left this world.
We are responsible for
those who are still on this world
all alive.
Acharya!
Chandra, how did you
know that we are here?
Because now, he thinks like I do.
But why do you look so worried,
Chandragupta?
My m-mother..
Dhananand has arrested her.
He said that he will kill my mother
if I do not take
you to him by the dusk.
Have you come to arrest me now?
No, Acharya.
I have just come with
a plan to get my mother free
and it is not possible without you.
I am sure that Chanakya
will not go out of Magadha.
But I am more interested
to know how my servant
would present that wicked
Chanakya before me by the dusk.
I want to know what plan he makes.
Look, Acharya, my mother will be here.
Maithri will distract
both these guards
and bring mother safely to this place.
Inder and Dhum are
digging a tunnel here.
That tunnel will
lead us to this place.
After this point my
mother will come out safely.
Tell me, Acharya. What do you think?
I think this is a good plan.
It is just that we
have very less time.
The dusk is just around the corner.
Mathri is taking a risk
by taking part in this plan.
She is in the palace of Dhananand.
She can even be suspected.
She might even get caught.
Maithri is ready to take this risk
to safeguard the queen of Peplivan.
- But I..
- No more discussions!
My mother's life is at risk.
All right.
We will go to that
forest and dig the tunnel.
But remember this.
Be ready as this plan might even fail.
I am ready, Acharya.
Bhairav has sent a message.
'Acharya, Maithri has sent a message.'
'The security arrangements
at the palace'
'She will have to
stay in a secret place'
'till the situation calms down.'
'What is your order?'
Acharya,
can I start digging the tunnel?
It is time for sunset.
Take this.
Maithri has sent a message.
She wants my permission
to leave Magadha.
This clearly means
that she is unaware about your plan
which can have only one outcome.
Your plan is not to free your mother
but to hold me captive.
Chandragupta!
Acharya, the path to free my mother
will be opened only
if you are held captive.
Forgive me.
But if I cannot save my mother
I do not think
I can find myself
capable enough to protect Magadha
and my motherland.
So, I will have to save my mother
to understand my own capability.
I will have to handover
you to Dhananand.
Your Majesty, it is time for sunset
and the time that you had
given to the servant, Chandragupta
is almost over.
And I am sure
that he cannot bring Chanakya.
Rakshas, even I think the servant
will disappoint me this time.
But it is good.
Success does not teach
a man what failure teaches him.
For example,
your failure of finding Chanakya
has inspired you to
become a capable warrior.
Isn't it?
The servant will also
learn a lesson from this.
Now, he will realise how painful it is
when you fail to fulfill your duty.
I am not scared of my death,
Dhananand.
Because I am happy due to the fact
that after my death
there will be somebody
who will be trying
continuously to destroy you.
And I will be pleased
to die with this happiness.
Let me fulfill
your wish immediately, Mura.
Your Majesty.
What happened?
That servant has held Chanakya
captive and he is bringing him here.
Chanakya, I will take
back from you with interest
the treasure that
you have stolen from me.
He is a thief. Don't spare him.
Shame on you. Shame on you.
Shame on you. Kill him.
Kill him. Kill him.
He is a thief. Shame on you.
'Forgive me, Acharya.'
'I will have to handover
you to Dhananand.'
'This is the only option
left to save my mother.'
'Chandragupta,
you are becoming emotional again'
'and taking a hasty decision.'
'And this emotion is
your biggest weakness too.'
'These emotions have
developed my personality.'
'I have met my mother
after a very long time'
'and I cannot lose her so easily,
Acharya.'
'Everything that we had
planned against Dhananand'
'will be destroyed due
to this one decision of yours.'
'I can understand your
emotions towards your mother.'
'I respect it too.'
'But do you not have any
duty towards your motherland?'
'I just know that my
mother's life is in danger'
'due to our plan for revolution.'
'And this is not necessary, Acharya.'
'You want to handover
me to Dhananand.'
'Handover me.'
'But remember'
'that your present deed
will affect your future too.'
'I am ready for that.'
'Very good.'
'Return me to Dhananand.'
'But do you think Dhananand
wants only Chanakya?'
'No, Chandragupta.'
'You will have to return the
stolen treasure to Dhananand too.'
'But, Acharya'
'we stole that treasure
with great difficulty and..'
'No, Indra!'
'If Chandragupta has
decided to hand me over'
'to Dhananand,
then let him have his way.'
'If he has already decided
'to return the stolen wealth
of Dhananand back to him'
'then let him return it.'
[Indistinct chatter]
That servant will get Chanakya
here soon, Your Highness.
There is one more good news,
Your Highness.
Along with Chanakya, that slave is also
bringing back my stolen wealth, right?
Yes, Your Highness.
Then don't just stand there, imbecile!
Go and check if that hapless monk
is giving back all my wealth or not.
Of course, Your Highness.
Now I can see it on your face..
Even your expression..
I can see your confidence
taking a beating.
The day which I was considering
to be my darkest day
that is going to turn out
to be the luckiest day for me.
Along with Magadha,
the entire world will see
that one gets death if
somebody tries to be my enemy!
And the joy which I am getting now
is because of that dirt ball
Chandragupta!
'Chandra, how could you do this?'
Slave, some day
I will definitely find out
how you manage to complete
such an impossible task.
Soldiers, immediately carry all the
baskets of wealth to the royal palace.
There onwards,
start counting the wealth.
Quickly inform me if
you find a lesser amount.
Where are you, slave?
My hacksaw is getting impatient
to taste the blood of Chanakya!
'All the incidents are leading
to complete my vow, Dhananand!'
'And the journey of your
legacy is coming to an end!'
'By stealing your wealth,
I made my first attack, Dhananand.'
Come, Chanakya!
Your time has come to meet death.
'Forgive me, Mother.'
'I know that you are
upset with my decision.'
'But after all these years, I do
not want to lose your motherly love.
'There was no option
left to save your life.'
Do you see this abandoned nest?
This shows the birds nesting here
has learnt to fly.
The birds have carried
on with their lives.
The same way
if we have to go forward in life
be successful,
then just like these birds
by giving up all the comforts of life
by leaving our secured surrounding..
We should face the challenges.
Remember that our past
becomes the biggest obstacle
while pursuing for a successful life.
My policies.
Your actions!
See, Chanakya.
Your oath and all your efforts
have brought you to this situation.
This handmaid and
you are about to die!
- Your Highness..
- Enough, slave!

================================================================================

'The braid that you insulted today..'
'I, Acharya Vishnugupta Chanakya
swear upon the same braid'
'that I will destroy
the Nand Dynasty, Dhananand!'
'I will dethrone you..'
'And crown a good ruler..'
'I, Vishnugupta Chanakya'
'swear to dethrone you.'
'I will unite India,
and bring forth the future emperor!'
Chanakya..
Where is your future emperor?
I do not see him here.
Perhaps, he is afraid of me.
See, Chanakya.
Your oath and all your efforts
have brought you to this situation.
This handmaid and
you are about to die!
- Your Highness..
- Enough, slave!
I know that you risked your life
to capture this cunning Brahmin.
In return,
I have given this handmaid
another day to live.
Nothing more than that.
But, Your Highness
this handmaid did not
aid Chanakya in this theft.
She has nothing
to do with this theft.
Even if that is the case she was
indeed happy because of the theft.
That is enough to execute her!
To save his mother's life
Chandra got Acharya captured.
But now, this evil Dhananand
will kill both of them.
Oh, Lord! What will happen now?
Now, both of you
get ready to die.
Brahmin, you are cunning
but it seems that
you are foolish as well.
That is why you are
laughing while facing death.
I am not laughing at my death,
Dhananand.
I am laughing at your cheap mentality.
You are as cheap and petty
as you were the other day
when I had sworn to dethrone you.
I am able to see what you cannot.
By the time you understand the same
the process of your
destruction would have started.
What do you want to say!
Your Highness, I know
what this Brahmin is trying to say.
I have understood his
thought process, Your Highness.
There is only one
meaning behind his words.
The woman who was once
Piplivan's queen..
If she is killed publicly
then the public will
consider her a martyr, right?
With this handmaid's death
the rebels will gain courage.
They will grow rebellious.
The public will think that a coward
who killed a handmaid,
is not worthy of being a king.
And finally, this thinking
will become the reason
of your kingdom's ruination.
Tell me, Brahmin!
This is what you meant, did you not?
That is why you were laughing
at the great King Dhananand!
You are too intelligent
for your age, slave.
With age, you are losing
your intelligence, Brahmin.
I pity you.
A boy as intelligent as Chandragupta
should have been
your chosen future king.
But it is your misfortune
that he supports me
and not you.
This handmaid's death will harm me
more than keeping her alive.
For now, it would be
better to let her live.
Free this handmaid.
I am feeling insulted today.
To save your mother you
did cheating with your motherland.
You saved me
but made me feel shameful.
Chanakya!
I spent much time thinking
up ways to kill you.
After thinking a lot, I have decided
to tear up the head that
plotted and schemed against me.
Tear him apart!
Stop, Your Highness!
Your Highness!
How dare you!
How dare you interrupt
such important work!
I beg your pardon,
Your Highness but..
But there is no
money in the baskets.
What!
There was no money in those baskets,
Your Highness.
When our soldiers opened
them they died on the spot.
But how did this happen?
'Now, along with fruits fill these
baskets with poisonous liquid.'
'As soon as the baskets are opened'
'the liquid will turn into vapour.'
'But, Chandra, what is your plan?'
'Please tell us.'
'As soon as these baskets reach
Dhananand, my plan will be revealed.'
'But we do not have much time.'
'Hurry up!'
Those baskets were emitting
a poisonous gas, Your Highness.
We have to leave this place now.
That gas will reach here soon.
We have to go to a safe place.
No!
Until this Brahmin
tells me where my money is
I will not leave this place.
Pardon me, Your Highness
but it can endanger your life.
I have to take you inside.
Come with me.
You wanted to know
whom I have chosen
to defeat you, right?
Who will be the future
emperor of united India?
Then listen to me, Dhananand.
My disciple
is as stubborn as I am.
His efforts will not die down
until he kills you.
Go, the countdown to your destruction
has started, Dhananand.
You will not die
until I find your future
emperor and my money.
Place this thief,
Chanakya, in the most severe prison!
Chanakya, look at him carefully.
He is the great riddle maker
who had helped you.
He had told you the answer to
that impossible riddle, did he not?
With its help,
you robbed my secret treasure.
Torture of only two days..
No food, water or a way to escape..
Because I had him
buried alive in the wall.
But he is still hanging
by a thread of hope.
He thinks that someone will come
to rescue him.
But he doesn't know
that when someone enters
in the jail of Magadh
then there is no place
of hope and desire for him.
No hope, mercy..
Yes, you can buy mercy
if you can pay the right price.
If you tell me where
you have hidden my money
then I will pity you
and definitely let you live.
Dhananand, by wearing a crown
and sitting on a
gem-encrusted throne
you can pretend to be a king
in front of the world
but not in front of me.
I know your reality.
You are just a merchant.
Chanakya!
A merchant with a sole duty.
It is to earn money.
To fulfill your duty
you know only one way.
It is to bargain.
You are doing the same now.
You were never a king, Dhananand.
You not only shamed
the ethics of a king
but also your caste and creed.
You are a 'Napit'.
A simple 'Napit'
works all day
and earns money
to live happily.
But you are that 'Napit' king,
Dhananand
who robs his subjects
of their hard-earned money.
You had a chance
to become a source of inspiration
to your caste,
creed and the 'Napit' society.
But you have been reduced
to a black mark of shame!
How much!
How much..
He preaches so much, Amatya Rakshas!
Do something to block
his words from reaching me.
I only want to hear
his painful screams!
I want to hear him plead!
Our prison has the most
severe torture instruments
in the world, does it not?
Yes, Your Highness.
Try that he gets to experience
the most severe torture.
Of course, Your Highness.
I will be glad to torture him.
Mother..
Why did you bring me here?
Why did you bring
me to my father's tomb?
You had taken an oath
to not visit this place, right?
Yes.
I had taken an oath that
I would visit this pious place
the day my son fulfill's
his father's last wish.
He would have returned the
respect that Piplivan had lost.
But today, I had to break my oath.
But it is not your fault.
It is the fault of the
motherly love I harbour for you.
I had thought
that my love for you
will make you courageous
support you and make you powerful.
But the same love
has become your weakness.
What are you saying, Mother?
I am telling the truth.
It was your weakness that you risked
Acharya Chanakya's life to save me.
Acharya Chanakya is
the creator of united India.
And I.. I am the former
queen of a divided state.
You risked the nation's
future to save me!
Being the future king of united India
you must know
that nothing is more important
than Acharya Chanakya.
Today, swear upon your father's tomb
that after today
you will not let your feelings
overwhelm your duties.
Take this oath, Chandra.
My father knew that
I am a sensitive Kshatriya
who is not only sensible
but also respects his feelings.
I was away from
my mother for 12 years.
Still, I remembered you.
I understood your pain.
My feelings are not my
weakness but my strength, Mother.
These feelings play
a major role in my existence.
No matter the obstacle
that I have to cross
still, I will use my
feelings to find a solution.
Just the way I did today
to save Acharya Chanakya and you.
But yes..
I, Chandragupta Maurya
consider my father
King Chandravardhan
Maurya's tomb as a witness
and swear
that Acharya Chanakya will never
lose his faith upon me.
I will always fulfill
Acharya Chanakya's hopes and ambition.
"Chandragupta Maurya!"
The sandalwood tree
is known in the world
for its light fragrance.
But the world often forgets
that the same sandalwood
tree plays host
to the most poisonous
snakes in the world.
Similarly, the one who speaks sweetly
can also harbour enmity towards you.
'Too much politeness is
the sign of a cunning person.'
The one who talks more
politely than necessary
can turn out to be
detrimental for you.
So, be it the sandalwood tree
or the people you meet in your life
give them a place in your
life after a thorough analysis.
You will be safe.
My ethics..
Your destiny.
Acharya, Bhadrasaal's mother has come
to know that I am prince of Piplivan.
He has sent a message to Dhananand.
He might be here any moment.

================================================================================

Episode: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-b23OgjUn5E

I am the Brahma..
I am the Brahma..
Vishnugupta Chanankya..
I am the Brahma..
This is hell made by
Amatya Rakshas Vishnugupta.
If you put your feet
then you will get burnt.
If you move your feet
aside then you will get hanged.
And you will die.
If you get unbalanced then you will
fall on burning coal and will burn.
If you try to escape
then my soldiers will not spare you.
You have only one option.
Tell me soon as to where you
have hidden the treasure of the king.
Who is it whom you want to save?
What is your conspiracy
against Magadh? Tell me!
[Sanskrit shlok]
Do you remember the
meaning of these words?
Or has the company of a cruel
and foolish king like Dhanananda
has made you forget your learnings?
It means
'I am the one'
'who brings everything
into existence.'
'Tiny drops of water
can make an ocean.'
'But it is also true that
the loss of just a water drop'
'from an ocean cannot
destroy its existence.'
This torture can hurt my body
but it cannot cause
any harm to my soul.
All these atrocities cannot
hurt my soul, Amatya Rakshas.
Because I am equal to Brahma.
This is your problem!
You are not Brahma,
but a mere Brahman.
You are a human and every
human has a limit to bear anything.
And when that limit gets crossed
a person loses his hope and courage.
I will make sure I make your cross
that level of tolerance, Chanakya.
Very soon, I will make you forget
your self-respect and bow down to me.
And that is when I will
ask you about your dear friends.
Torture him so much
that he should think of his death,
every second.
Hurt him more!
I am the Brahma.. I am the Brahma..
My dear friend,
Seleucus, has sent me this.
These clothes and grains.
The two basic needs of life.
This is not a gift.
It is a mockery on
my current situation.
He wants to show sympathy towards me
since I lost my treasure.
Your Highness we must
answer Seleucus back.
No.. No..
Anger is a quality of the weak,
Bhadrasaal.
Instead of showing anger
we should prove to Seleucus
and the whole world
that I am yet the most
powerful and impeccable.
That I am as predominant
as I was before
in spite of facing such a big loss.
Gather the soldiers, Bhadrasaal.
I want to make a special announcement.
Chandra.
I have seen some servants
making the king's chariot ready.
They are preparing to
take him out of the palace.
I am sure that the king is going
out of the palace for a few days.
What?
Only the king can
give me the permission
to meet Chanakya in the dungeon.
I must do something.
- Long live King Dhananand.
- Long live!
- Long live King Dhananand.
- Long live!
- Long live King Dhananand.
- Long live!
- Long live King Dhananand.
- Long live!
- Long live King Dhananand.
- Long live!
- Long live King Dhananand.
- Long live!
- Long live King Dhananand.
- Long live!
- Long live King Dhananand.
- Long live!
- Long live King Dhananand.
- Long live!
- Long live King Dhananand.
- Long live!
Emperor's sudden decision
of going out of the palace
and gathering his army here..
- Long live King Dhananand.
- Long live!
What is he up to?
- Long live King Dhananand.
- Long live!
- Long live King Dhananand.
- Long live!
The brave hearts of Magadh
the festival of 'Maha
Poornima' is around the corner
and on that auspicious day
the great Magadh will proceed towards
gaining control over the whole Bharat.
Magadh will form an
alliance with Seleucus
and attack the 15 kingdoms
and invade them.
15?
'Exactly after a month from now'
'on the occasion of 'Maha Poornima''
'we will begin this
movement of revolt.'
'That means,
the festival night on which
'Acharya is planning
to revolt against Dhananand'
'is the same time when
Dhananand will proceed'
'with this plan of his with Seleucus.'
I will personally conduct
the battle training program
for the next two days
where every soldier of our army
will polish his battling skills
and make himself ready
for the upcoming war.
Hail!
- Long live King Dhananand.
- Long live!
- Long live King Dhananand.
- Long live!
- Long live King Dhananand.
- Long live!
- Long live King Dhananand.
- Long live!
- Long live King Dhananand.
- Long live!
- Long live King Dhananand.
- Long live!
What did Chanakya tell you?
Where is my treasure, Amatya?
I was unsuccessful in finding
that out, Your Highness.
He is the one responsible
for your humiliation.
He is the reason
why I got your hair cut.
If anyone looks here,
I will gouge his eyes!
It pains, right?
Amatya, that humiliation
still hurts you, does it not?
What is the use if you
cannot make him reveal it?
Your Highness
I caused all those atrocities on him
which nobody could bear ever.
It looks like he still
remains unaffected.
But rest assured.
I will make sure
he accepts his defeat one day.
I will keep hurting him,
Your Highness until
he tells where he has hidden
the treasure he stole from you.
'I am responsible for
the pain Acharya is suffering.'
'He is suffering because of me.'
'But not anymore.'
Forgive me, Your Highness.
I think Amatya's efforts
are praiseworthy.
But they are not effective.
Servant!
Your Highness, the first time
I tried to find Chanakya
disguised as a Brahman.
The second time
I captured him by deceit.
Both of my attempts were successful.
So I think
instead of a straightforward effort
we should break
Chanakya through deceit.
If Amatya does not have any objection
I would like to help him.
- But it is not so easy..
- Amatya!
Because of your ego, you have lost
the golden opportunity
to take revenge from Chanakya.
But I will not lose my money.
- Bhadrasaal.
- Your Highness.
Do not stop this servant from meeting
with Chanakya for the next two days.
For the next two days,
I will be at warfare maneuver camp.
As you wish, Your Highness.
And you..
You know what kind of a welcome
I want when I return, right?
You will get the results,
Your Highness.
You heard the king, Commander
immediately take me to Chanakya.
Let us go.
Vishnugupta!
Ayah, I want you
to keep a keen eye on that servant.
I have given him the responsibility
to get Chanakya to talk
and I want you to know
their conversation completely.
I want you to know about
every single word they exchange.
But, Your Highness, that Chanakya
is securely imprisoned.
How can I keep an eye
on that servant there?
If I go to the jail,
both Chanakya and that servant
will get alert.
Ayah, sometimes ears
can work as eyes.
The walls of the prison
where Chanakya is kept have ears.
You can listen to their conversation
from the room adjacent to the prison
because one of the walls is hollow.
I understand, Your Highness.
Do not worry.
I will keep both my eyes
and ears on that servant.
One more thing, Ayah
as soon as you find
out something important
contact me directly.
You will give that
information only to me
no one else.
As you wish, Your Highness.
'I give you my word'
'I will take your
revenge from Dhananand.'
What happened, servant?
I want to go alone from here.
I hope you do not have any problem
with questioning Chanakya.
Not at all.
Acharya!
Acharya?
Forgive me, Acharya.
You are suffering
so much because of me.
But do not worry, Acharya
I will get you out of here soon.
No matter what the consequence is
I cannot leave one more great
man to die here because of my duty.
Just a while ago
I saw Tithiraj's
body being carried away.
But I will not let that
happen to you, Acharya.
Before Dhananand gives you
one such terrible death I will
get you out of here, Acharya.
Chandragupta,
do not magnify the mistake
you made because of
getting blinded by emotions
by getting blinded by emotions again.
Do not do any foolishness.
If you really want my forgiveness
then stay focused on your target.
To free Magadh from Dhananand
you have to take the throne of Magadh.
High Majesty does not know
that he is sheltering a traitor.
His favourite and beloved slave
is conspiring against him.
I have understood, Acharya
that both I and my goal
are incomplete without your help.
Just become free and
we will get everything.
Dhananand has gone out of
Pataliputra for a couple of days.
This will be the
right time to free you.
Dhananand is not in Pataliputra?
For him, nothing is
more precious than wealth.
Where could he go despite
such a danger upon his wealth?
And why?
He has arranged for
some military training.
He has gone there
to conquer 15 states.
Acharya, this time my sole goal
is to free you from the prison.
No, Chandragupta!
When the motherland
is in the hands of tyrants
there is no value
for mine or your life.
If Dhananand is successful
in establishing his rule
over the 15 states
with the help of Seleucus
no one will be able
to do anything against them.
My wounds will heal, Chandragupta.
But the destruction those
two will bring upon the motherland
our motherland will never
be able to heal from that.
Dhananand and Seleucus's friendship
is the greatest danger
to sovereignty of India.
We have to sow the seed
of distrust between them.
We have to bring Seleucus
over to our side.
Their friendship is very strong.
Both of them are greedy for power.
Those who have such
a quality in their character
all their bonds are momentary.
This strong friendship
between them is a pretext.
Deep inside,
they hold distrust for each other.
That is the reason
Dhananand has arranged
the war training
camp despite the
danger upon his wealth.
It is a signal to Seleucus
that he is still mighty.
That is all right, Acharya.
Even if we do increase the
feeling of distrust between them
what will that accomplish?
We will use Seleucus'
army against Dhananand.
We will remove Dhananand
from his throne.
We will bring light to our
goal of unification revolution.
This is the reason..
Chanakya was brought
in as a prisoner twice..
The punishment for
betraying Dhananand..
I will give it to you!
Acharya, if we use Seleucus' army
how will your dream
of unite India come true?
Seleucus will take Dhananand's place
and then he will become our enemy.
[Sanskrit shlok]
It means that those who save
even the half during
times of danger are wise.
Seleucus is our friend as long
as Dhananand is our enemy.
After Dhananand's end
we have to unite all the states
and remove Seleucus
from the borders of India.
And then
the entire India will
have one rule, one king
Chandragupta Maurya,
the Prince of Piplivan.
I was right!
Chandragupta is Piplivan's prince.
Mura's son!
No matter how dangerous weapons are
if they are not sharpened at times
they lose their edge.
Human brain and body
are like a sword.
If your brain is not confronted
with problems on times
it becomes less active.
Just like that,
if the body forgets struggle
or practice of facing tough situations
it starts to become weak.
So if you get tough
situations in your life
do not turn away from them.
Face them.
If you turn away,
you turn away from your security
and your progress.
My ethics..
Your destiny.
A delay of moment in giving this
message of conspiracy to king would be..
Acharya, Bhadrasaal's mother has come
to know that I am prince of Piplivan.
He has sent message to Dhananand.
He would be here any moment.

================================================================================

Episode: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0rQ797e9o8

Acharya promise me,
the moment you feel
that you are succumbing to the torture
you will tell me immediately.
Promise me.
All right, Chandragupta.
But now, leave quickly.
You do not have much time
to face all the difficulties.
Go, Chandragupta.
Save India.
Save India before
Dhananand destroys it.
All right, Acharya.
If I delay in informing
the king about this conspiracy
it will prove fatal for him.
I should inform the king right away.
There is no soldier or messenger here.
Where are they all?
How do I send this message?
Tell me, lady.
Do you need to send a message?
I need permission to
meet the king right away.
Of course, lady. I know where he is.
I will take your message
to him right away.
Wait!
Not you.
I will ask someone
else to send the message.
Lady, you know
that I am the fastest messenger in the
state. I will give him the message.
You might be,
but I do not need you for this task.
Where are they?
No messenger is here. Where are they?
What happened, Mother?
You seem anxious.
I need to send an important
message to the king.
I need a messenger.
If that is the case to the king.
I will take your message
Yes.
'As soon as you find
some important information'
'you will contact me directly.'
'You will give that
message to only me'
'and not anyone else.'
No.
Just tell the king that I have to
meet him as soon as possible.
This information cannot wait
until the end of his conference.
He has to return to
the palace immediately!
Of course, Mother.
Chandra, it is done.
This herbal paste will heal
Acharya's wounds and lessen his pain.
Before anyone comes here
take this medicine to Acharya.
All right, Mother.
G-Greetings. I was passing from here.
I saw the things scattered
around here and stopped.
Look, that handmaid has
made such useless utensils.
Moreover,
she has increased the work here.
I wonder why she is so absent-minded.
The king has high hopes for you.
You know very well what you have to
do with those who fail to serve him.
If you have to work
harder for this task
then take the help of this slave.
He will never refuse to help you.
I believe that.
I have some other work.
I will leave now.
Greetings, lady.
Chandra, I have to tell
you something important.
Be quick, Dhumketu.
I have to go to the Acharya.
Amatya Rakshas' torture
must have hurt him a lot.
Chandra,
Bhadrasal's mother wanted to send
an important message to the king.
It was important.
When I told her that I would
take her message she refused.
She sent the message
through Bhadrasal.
Not only that, Chandra..
She did not give a written
message to Bhadrasaal
and asked him to inform the
king to return as soon as possible.
She has a piece of
important information.
Chandra, do you not
think that it is suspicious?
Dhumketu,
she is the king's foster mother.
She keeps doing things like these.
Do not pay attention to it.
I have to go to Acharya now.
He needs me.
This paste is too runny.
What could I do, Acharya?
This paste was made in a hurry.
Bhadrasaal's mother..
What happened?
Why are you suddenly
thinking about her?
I wonder what her problem is.
My mother was making earthen pots.
She came there and
broke all the earthen pots.
She ruined my mother's hard work.
One more thing.
She wanted to send a piece
of important information to the king.
But she sent Bhadrasaal
and not Dhumketu.
I think that to exact revenge upon me
she hurts my dear ones.
Shrewd woman!
No, Chandragupta.
This cannot be a coincidence.
There is something that
has escaped our notice.
There is a link that
we are unable to connect.
Otherwise, it cannot be a coincidence
that she wants to send
some information to Dhananand.
Oh, Lord!
- She knows everything.
- Who knows everything?
Bhadrasaal's mother.
She has come to know everything.
The walls are not soundproof,
Chandragupta.
This wall is hollow.
I am sure that Dhananand must have
appointed her to keep an eye on us.
She now knows everything
regarding the both of us.
She knows about your mother, Mura.
She knows that you are
the prince of Piplivan.
She even knows about
our plan regarding Seleucus.
Moreover
she even knows about the
rebellion on the full moon day.
It means
that everything has come to an end.
No. Not yet.
If you stop her when
we still have time
then we may be able to save our plan.
Go, Chandragupta. Go now.
All right.
You were looking for me,
while I was looking for you.
I have heard everything.
I am aware of your true identity.
Prince of Piplivan!
A prince? What are you saying?
I am a slave. An insignificant slave.
I think you are mistaken.
- At least, listen to me..
- Enough!
Do not dare to utter another word!
Enough of your acting!
You have trapped everyone
with your silver tongue!
You have betrayed the king!
You will be definitely
punished for the same!
Lady.. At least, listen to m-me.
You are mistaken.
- You are misunderstanding me.
- Quiet!
I misunderstood you until now.
I always doubted you.
On you and that wicked woman, Mura.
But the king
killed an innocent person.
But now, your lie has been exposed.
I have sent a message to the king
and he is on his way back.
You must be praying
that the king never enters Magadh.
But this will not happen!
He will be here soon
and flay all of you alive!
Lady, try to understand me.
Why did you stop?
Did you run out of words?
This is what happens.
A lie cannot that she wants
to send some information to Dhananand.
That's why the great rebel of Piplivan
Chandragupta Maurya,
seems to be worried.
I want
you to receive such
torture before you die
that your death seems easier to you.
So let us go, Prince.
Lady!
It is Bhadrasaal's mother!
I have to sound the
alarm of danger soon.
My bangle?
Where did my mother's bangle go?
'Is my bangle in her hands?'
Slave!
Yes, Princess?
Were you looking for me?
Yes.
I mean, I was looking for words.
I am writing a poem.
But I am stuck at one line.
I am unable to form words.
Will you help me
in completing the poem?
Wait, let me recite it to you.
'I am eager to find only one thing.'
'I wish my life partner
comes to me one day.'
'Before anyone finds that bangle'
'I have to reach
Bhadrasaal's mother soon.'
Tell me, slave.
'Life is momentous.'
'Death comes for all of us one day.'
Amazing! You rhymed the words!
Wow, slave!
Is there something that you cannot do?
Now, my poem is complete.
I will go and recite
it to Bhadrasaal's mother.
This alarm goes off
when a member of
the royal family dies.
I pray to God that
Chandragupta has found
a solution to stop Bhadrasaal's mother
and this bell has been
rung because of the same.
Mother.. Mother..
Bhadrasaal's mother.
- Oh, God!
- Mother!
Lady.. How did this happen?
Someone, call the physician
as soon as possible!
Let us lie her corpse
down on its back.
Stop!
How can a man touch her body?
Have you forgotten your manners?
'What does she want to tell me?'
'What is so important that
she called me immediately?'
'Is it related to the conversation
between the slave and Chanakya'
'that I had asked her to eavesdrop?'
'Is Chanakya conspiring against me?'
'She is not holding my bangle.
Then where did it go?'
Please move back, Shipra.
I need to perform an analysis.
Get up.
Mother, I am innocent.
I did not kill her.
I know that.
But she is no more.
You will have to stay alert in future.
Thank you, Mother.
Say something, Physician.
Mother!
I am unable to believe
that she is no more. Mother!
You are right, Shipra.
She is still alive.
Really?
Hurry up!
Take her to the treatment room.
'If she regains consciousness,
she will reveal my secret.'
'What should I do now?'
Come..come..
The birds that are restrained
in a cage since their birth
cannot fly away from an open cage
even after they grow up.
They keep wandering around the cage.
The same thing happens
with domesticated animals.
Have you ever thought
about why it happens?
Why do they not escape
even after cutting
their bonds loose?
Why do they not fly away?
They stay near us.
Because the most dangerous dependency
or slavery is psychological.
If someone becomes
a slave psychologically
then even after the bonds are severed
that person does not
try to live independently.
So, be it a person or a thought..
Be it a thing of leisure or a place..
Do not become dependent
on them so much
that your heart forgets to beat.
Keep your heart open.
If your heart is free
then no one can enslave you.
My ethics..
Your destiny.
I am convinced that it
is him who pushed mother over
in order to kill her.
If the servant is behind all
this then he will surely be punished.

Episode: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRoyLvKhUKo

Royal Physician.
She will be healed soon, will she not?
As per royal protocol, I shall give out
any details regarding her treatment
only to the Emperor.
Attention!
The Lord of Magadh,
Emperor Dhananand is approaching!
Yes, Mother. Tell me..
Mother!
My Lady..
Brother!
Brother!
Royal Physician.
When will she regain consciousness?
After falling from such great
height her nervous system has failed.
The nerve connections of her brain
to the body have been severed.
She might wake up now,
or in a day's time
or it might take her
a week or even a month.
Or she might never wake up at all.
At the moment,
medication alone will not help.
It is love that will truly heal her.
She can hear everything
but cannot speak.
She can feel but cannot express.
If she ever awoke..
She will definitely wake up,
Royal Physician.
Unless she has passed on
the important information to me
she cannot leave her earthly form.
Exit!
Mahamatya, Bhadrasaal!
Until Bhadrasaal's mother
regains consciousness
have her quarters cordoned off.
Surround her room with
seven tier impenetrable security.
So that no one is able
to enter her room but me.
Even the royal physician will
attend to her only in my presence.
Every moment of every day
the security guards
will keep a close watch.
Why the tight security, Brother?
This was a mere accident.
No more than a tragic co-incidence.
She fell from a height
and got injured.
No..
She is not one to simply fall over.
She is a fighter.
I am sure someone pushed her over.
You will see the plight
of the one who did this to her.
I shall inflict
hellish torture on him.
I think I know who has done this.
Your obedient servant, Chandragupta.
I deeply regret the
narrowness of your minds.
Anything that might
go wrong in the universe
shall always be attributed
to that servant by you all.
I beg you pardon, My Lord.
But my allegations are not baseless.
Neither do they root
from my dislike for him.
I have solid evidence
to back my opinion.
What evidence do you have?
Absence.
Absence?
Yes, My Lord.
Look at this. I have records
of the entries made into the prison.
Chandragupta has signed
here at this time.
That means, he was not with Chanakya.
Then when mother met with
this accident where was he?
I am convinced
that it is him who pushed mother over
in order to kill her.
He has a clear motive for doing this.
Mother always treated him
and his three friends with suspicion.
When you were not present at the
palace he took the opportunity to try
and kill mother.
Mother did not trust Chandragupta
and his three friends so much so that
instead of his friend Dhumketu
she chose me to deliver
the important information to you.
'Just tell the emperor that I
need to see him as soon as possible.'
'This message cannot wait
until after his camp is over.'
'He must return to
the palace immediately.'
My Lord.
I agree with Commander Bhadrasaal.
Me too, My Lord.
If the servant is behind all this
then he will surely be punished.
He will have to pay
penalty for every breath
that Bhadrasaal's mother
takes in this condition of hers.
Whatever happened
was not right, Mother.
Irrespective of the sort
of person Bhadrasaal's mother is
she is still a lady.
And an aged lady.
And today, because of me..
she is lying on her deathbed.
I deserve to be punished, Mother.
And whatever happens now
I am ready to face it.
Chandra, listen to me carefully.
What happened was no fault of yours.
You did not intend to do any of it.
That was nothing but a mere accident.
- But Mother..
- No, Chandra.
You did try to save her.
But it was not within your control.
That is why,
you must believe me, Chandra.
You are not a criminal.
You must get rid of the fear
and guilt gnawing at your heart.
As long as there is
fear and guilt in your heart
your face shall reflect it.
And Dhananand can smell
fear from miles away.
So, Chandra, say it..
You did not attempt to kill her.
Say it, Chandra!
Yes. I did not attempt
to kill Bhadrasaal's mother
Look me in the eye and say it.
Yes. I did not attempt
to kill Bhadrasaal's mother
I am not a criminal.
Yes, Chandra. You are not a criminal.
Do you understand?
You are not a criminal.
I have one more reason
to suspect Chandragupta.
at such an inopportune moment
when the entire palace staff
and members have gathered here..
Everyone is concerned about the events
that led to Mother's accident
he is nowhere to be seen.
Usually, he is always
around every incident
major or minor,
to express his opinion.
- Where is he today?
- I was at the temple.
To pray for the well being
and longevity of Bhadrasaal's mother.
What do you reckon?
That you will manage to
befool us with your excuses?
You must have been to the temple
to pray for yourself instead.
The truth is that you are the one
who attempted to kill mother.
What are you saying,
Commander Bhadrasaal?
Why would I want to
kill Bhadrasaal's mother.
There could be many reasons
but we need not get
into the details right now.
Right now, what is important is that
you were missing at
the time of the accident.
Where were you?
And this evidence alone
is enough to prove you guilty.
Speak up. Tell us where you have been.
He was with me.
What?
Yes, Brother. At the time of the
accident the servant boy was with me.
He was helping me finish my poem.
We were together when
we heard the bell ring.
And together we ran to the place
where Bhadrasaal's mother had fallen.
Chandragupta, you have
brought offerings from the temple
for Bhadrasaal's mother have you not?
Hand it over to him.
Who knows,
God might answer your prayers.
I hope..
That your mother returns
to good health soon.
'I must meet Chanakya soon.'
'My Lady, I want you to keep
a close watch on that servant boy.'
'I have entrusted him with
the duty of making Chanakya speak'
'and you must closely
monitor their conversations.'
'The prison Chanakya stays in'
'there the walls have ears.'
'Yes, Emperor.'
'Dhananand still suspects you,
servant boy.'
'And he will substantiate
his suspicion now.'
I have come here in a discreet manner
because everyone in
the palace is suspecting me
especially when I come here
I feel as if everyone thinks,
I am a traitor.
I have come here to
warn you for the last time.
Be careful.
You can get yourself into danger.
I despise it
when I am the reason
for people's suspicions.
I despise it when people call
me your disciple, you fraudster!
You are the reason for
all what is happening with me.
You still have a chance.
If you have a hand
in the murder of the maid
then, better surrender
yourself right now.
She was just a maid.
But, the emperor
considered her as his mom.
Thus, she is equivalent
to being a queen.
And to murder a queen
is a big crime in itself.
But, if you accept your crime
I will request emperor
to give you some grace.
But, that will happen
only if you accept your guilt.
Whether it is a sin or virtue
if I haven't done something
why should I accept it?
But, I do confess that
I stole Dhananand's money.
I also confess
that, I have hatched a
conspiracy to outhrow Dhananand
and make someone much
more able to replace him.
But, murdering a woman
is beyond all thoughts and desires!
So, what you are trying to say
is that, it was an accident!
That she fell down from such a height
and you have nothing to do with it!
Use your brains, my dear.
You have locked me up in this room.
It's been a long time since
I have seen the light of the day.
I can barely breathe fresh air
and you are alleging me
of having committed a murder!
You think,
I would've called someone here
and instructed him
to go and murder the maid.
I am sorry to say this
but you are nowhere close
to what I thought you are.
Don't think you will be
able to mislead me you fraudster!
You only know to talk big, my dear.
Only one thing is
prominent from your talks
and that is, there has been
an attempt to murder the maid
and it has been useless.
She is very much alive
and wil come out of
her consciousness one day.
When that happens,
she will tell the emperor
what happened with her
and who tried to murder her.
And then, the culprits cannot escape.
'Seleucus!'
'I have understood,
what you are trying to convey to me.'
'Before the maid comes
back to her senses'
'I will see to it that Dhananand
and Seleucus' friendship breaks.'
Okay. I am going now.
- But, I will soon be back.
Okay, get going. Whenever
you come my answer will be the same.
So, don't waste you
time on me anymore.
You may go now.
Who does this priest think he is?
Why is he so arrogant?
Your Highness, you are here?
Come with me.
After Durdhara's statement
everyone stopped suspecting you.
But you know me.
I do not blindly trust anyone.
Even if everyone stopped suspecting
you after Durdhara's statement
I still suspected you.
That is why I followed
you and listened
to the conversation
between you and Chanakya.
What!
But how?
There was no one there
other than Chanakya and me.
It is not important
how I listened to it
the important thing is that
you have proved yourself innocent.
I am happy that you performed
admirably in this test.
Now I declare you innocent.
You did not attack ayah.
Thank you, Your Highness.
As your servant, I have to prove
my loyalty every day, every moment.
And I have no problem with that.
My body and heart is at your service.
Good.
But that conversation
with Chanakya has disturbed me.
That is why I have thought
of a special punishment for him.
Chanakya, you are in a terrible state.
It is as if your life has no purpose
but to end itself circling
around this crusher.
You are a scholar, a learned man.
Why? Why are you putting
yourself through this?
Tell me!
Where have you hid my treasure?
Fine.
Do not tell me.
Tomorrow,
my bulls would take your place
and I would be blissfully
happy with my treasure. And you!
You will spend
the rest of your life
treating these wounds.
Until His Highness asks
you to stop keep walking, Priest!
Dhananand, you..
No matter how much you make me suffer
but the pain I caused you
by stealing your treasure
compared to that, I do not even feel
the pain of wounds
you have inflicted upon me.
If I feel anything, it is happiness.
I feel happiness.
Chanakya!
Do not give him food or water today.
'Acharya, forgive me.'
'You have to suffer
so much because of me.'
'But not anymore.'
'I will free you from here.'
Do you see this lotus flower?
It's journey of life is very strange.
It's life starts in mud.
But it does not let that mud
stain its existence.
It is considered so
pure that it is offered
to the Goddess of money,
Laxmi, Herself.
The same way,
in what conditions a person is born
which family he belongs to
does not decide that person's future.
Rather, their actions
build their future.
That is why, if you want a good future
choose to do good things.
My ethics..
Your destiny.
'Be careful. Today, Amatya
was here to ruin your strategy.'
Amatya Rakshas.
'I will kill two
birds with one stone.'
'I will take down
Dhananand and Seleucus.'

================================================================================

Episode: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kOoZZx9rR4

'I must find a way to release
Acharya as soon as possible.'
'But how?'
'I have to find out
about Bhadrasaal's mother'
'from the royal
physician at any cost.'
Royal physician!
Greetings!
Everyone is doing his or her bit
to get Bhadrasaal's mother treated.
Can I help you in any way?
Do not worry. We are giving
her a new form of treatment.
She will be fine soon.
In fact, sooner than
what we are expecting.
Oh, I see!
That is good news.
What are you doing, Chandra?
Have you gone mad?
Why are you pelting
stones at the king's statue?
Do you even know its punishment?
What else should I do!
What else do you expect
from a frustrated person
who is failing time and again?
He is that Dhananand
who has tortured
Acharya Chanakya so much
that even thinking
about it makes me scared.
He is that wicked person
who has reduced my
mother to be his servant.
He is the person who
has befriended Seleucus
and terrorised entire India!
Why do you not try to break
their friendship, Chandra?
After all, Acharya has handed
this responsibility to you.
Yes.
But I cannot do anything alone,
Stulbhadra.
I do not have anyone to guide me.
Neither Acharya nor my mother.
What do you mean?
Dhananand has banned
Acharya from meeting anyone.
That means
nobody can even go to
supply food or water to him.
And on the other hand
he has sent my mother
with the other servants
to fetch soil from the banks of Ganga.
It is because of Dhananand
that I am unable to
contact those two people
who are the most important
to me at this time.
The time is passing.
Bhadrasaal's mother
can recover at any time.
I do not know what to do!
My life without Acharya
is like a bow without an arrow.
I am directionless.
Idea!
I have an idea.
Chandra, why do we not bring
Seleucus and Dhananand together
and let them have
plenty of alcohol?
And then, they will
start cursing each other and
start fighting.
Okay, I will think of something else.
Chandra,
I would have surely helped you.
But I need to go now.
One of the troops is going
to Seleucus with Dhananand.
They might leave at any moment.
My absence there can raise suspicions.
What?
What did you say?
Are they going to meet Seleucus?
That means
they are forming a new strategy
to attack the 15 districts.
Perhaps, I know what I have to do.
Acharya Chanakya,
you will be proud of me.
Friends, trust me..
I am nothing without you.
Nobody can motivate
me as well as you do.
That is all right, Chandra.
But what will you do now?
Something which can result
in mass devastation.
And the first level of my plan
is to make Amatya
doubt his own skills.
This great strategy is surely
beyond the imagination
of even Seleucus and his army.
If we frame the strategy
the battle will be under the control
of our king, Dhananand.
Very well, Amatya. Amazing.
I will be waiting for you outside.
Amatya, I want to talk
to you about something important.
You should not stop people who
are heading for something auspicious.
How can I expect a cheap
servant like you to know this?
Amatya!
I know that you are still upset
with me that I got your braid cut.
Even Bhadrasal is
holding me responsible
for what happened with his mother.
That is why I have taken the
initiative of proving my dedication.
Look, I know that it is important
for us to invade the 15 districts.
This is a matter of
reputation for our king.
His honour is at
stake before Seleucus.
That is why I have made
this strategy for the war.
Will a servant like you
teach me to strategise?
No, Amatya. That is not the case.
Look, I know
that the king does
not trust you completely.
In such situations a person
tends to lose self-confidence.
One starts doubting
his own capabilities.
If you ever feel
that your strategy is not foolproof
my strategy will prove
to be helpful for you.
Because somewhere, down the line
the king and I think the same way.
And yes, you can take its credit.
'I should now seek
advice from someone else'
'because you are now blinded with
your hate towards that servant.'
'I will come back to you only when
you get rid of your misconceptions.'
'Go ahead, Amatya.'
'The actual auspicious
work will start now.'
'But it will be auspicious
for me and not for you.'
Your Highness!
Amatya Rakshas
my prime strategist.
I heard that you have been making
this strategy for the last two nights.
I hope you will present
it perfectly before Seleucus.
I just want us to be
ahead of him in every front.
For sure, Your Highness.
I just want us to be
stronger than Seleucus.
And as you know
Seleucus and I had a deal,
that the one who presents
the most desirable strategy
will direct this war.
It is that winning
king who will direct
both Greek and our army
to win over the 15 districts.
As you know
I do not like fighting battles
under somebody else's direction.
My honour is at stake, and yours too.
This is your golden chance
to win back my trust and respect.
I hope that you will
not disappoint me.
Rest assured, Your Highness.
My strategy will surely
make you victorious.
Very good!
'I hope that I can make
him win with my strategy'
'and get back my lost honour.'
'My plan is working.'
Come forward.
Let us strategies our plan.
- Of course. Philip!
- Patience, Seleucus.
Amongst us Amatya Rakshas
is the eldest and also
more experienced than us.
For the sake of his
experience and capability
we should allow him to share his views
and strategy with us first.
Perhaps,
after listening to his strategy
you may not have to
explain your strategy.
I am a valiant warrior
of Macedonia, King.
I believe in capability and not age.
As you are my friend
I will not ignore your words.
Let me see Amatya's strategy.
- We will decide the right strategy.
- Of course!
Amatya Rakshas.
Of course.. Your Highness.
'If you ever feel'
'that your strategy is not foolproof'
'my strategy will prove
to be helpful for you.'
'Because somewhere, down the line
the king and I think the same way.'
You may notice that here..
There are 16 districts
that together form India.
But the most powerful
district of all these
is the one and only Magadh.
How should we conquer
the rest of the districts..
Please allow me to explain it.
First..
We will attack those districts
that are small and weak.
It will be easy to conquer them.
Gaining victory over them
will give confidence to our army.
Gradually,
we will attack the remaining districts
and come out victorious.
As it has been decided,
that on the full moon night
with the blessings of Lord Shiva,
we will commence our attack
and hoist our flags
in all these districts.
When the strategy is weak
then even God cannot give us victory.
Please be clear in what you say,
Seleucus!
I will explain what
I want to say, King.
Definitely,
we can attack the smallest district
but that will not benefit us.
Did you see, Your Highness..
More than gaining,
we will lose in this minor attack.
The news of the attack
will reach the powerful districts
and they will get time
to get ready for the battle.
We cannot afford to lose time
and time is the most powerful
weapon in a battle, Your Highness.
But if we attack and capture
the strongest district..
Did you notice what happened here?
The entire structure crumbled
when the support was removed.
If we strike and capture
the strongest district
then the rest of the 14 districts
will surrender to us out of fear.
Our youngest and the
least experienced warrior
Philip has strategised this plan.
who is way young compared to Amatya.
As I explained, King..
I believe in capability
and not the age of a person.
Your Highness, tell me..
Do you still believe
in the strategy of Amatya?
I do not think so because
Amatya has lost your trust.
We all can see the result of the same.
His braid that has been cut off..
You had cut it.
Your Highness, tell me..
Do you agree to my battle strategy?
As it was decided
the one whose strategy will be good,
he will lead the battle.
Only that person
will command the army.
Yes, Seleucus.
Your strategy for
the battle is the best.
I had told you,
that this was the right opportunity
for you to make yourself proud
in my eyes but you disappointed me!
Because of you, I was insulted again!
In front of everybody,
Seleucus insulted me
and portrayed himself to be superior.
Now, Seleucus will
lead the army of Magadh!
I am disappointed with you!
Stop there!
Remove your footwear
and walk barefoot until the palace!
You heard me!
This is your punishment,
Amatya Rakshas!
'Great, Chandra! Your plan worked.'
'By making Amatya
doubt his own decisions'
'you changed his strategy
at the nick of time.'
'Now, it is the time for
the second stage of your plan.'
Now starts the next stage of my plan..
Amatya and Seleucus
will go against each other.
Nab him! He should not escape!
Sire, I think that intruder sent
a message with the help of this arrow.
'Be careful. Today, Amatya was here
to ruin your strategy.'
'By ruining his strategy, I proved'
'that I am your well-wisher.'
'We will meet again.'
Who in Magadh is concerned about me?
"Chandragupta.."
"Chandragupta.."
'I will kill two
birds with one stone.'
'I will take down
Dhananand and Seleucus.'
Did you see
that to burn a small page
even the mighty Sun has to become
a thin ray of light
and focus at one point?
In the same way
even if you are strong and capable
but if you do not focus
your energy and efforts
at a single point
then you will not gain victory.
My ethics..
Your destiny.
For a guerilla war we
will reciprocate likewise.
Stab in the back and be
ready to be stabbed in the back.
Amatya! Who did this to you?

================================================================================

'You were never a king, Dhananand.'
'Not just the throne's pride'
'but you have also humiliated your
class and your very own echelon.'
'You had an opportunity'
'to be the torch bearer for your
class for the disconsolate society.'
'And here you standas
a scar of disgrace.'
'Our youngest and the
least experienced warrior'
'Philip has strategised this plan.'
'And he is a lot younger than Amatya.'
'Tell me, if you accept my proposal.'
'As decided, the better warrior'
'will be ahead in the game.'
'He will rule the empire.'
The enemies of Dhananand will
experience my true strength now.
I have something perhaps nobody
would have even imagined of.
Agnimukh.
Speak of the devil.
The Ex-Commander-in-Chief of Piplivan.
The warriors of Piplivan..
I hope you all remember
we made a deal in exchange
for your lives.
You will mine gold coins for me
and make my palace a gold mine.
This is the very reason
you all are here
in this gold mine to work for me.
Far away from Magadh
at this distant gold mine your job
is to stock Dhananand's repository.
I am here to tell you
something significant.
From today onwards without rest
and without catching a breath you
all will work every hour of the day.
As time never stops flowing you
will not stop working at any cost.
Every single person
will keep working with rest
until my command.
Sorry, King!
But, they are already pushing
themselves beyond the limit.
They do not get enough
time to eat or sleep.
Taken away this time
it will be a disaster.
The man over there..
He is running high fever
since the past three days.
Yet, he is working
without medication or rest.
Is it so? I still see him standing.
He is able to drink water.
It clearly means there is
still some strength left in him.
And this strength better
be used to stock my repository.
But, King..
After a king makes his
decision hesitation or refusal
often brings one closer to his end,
Agnimukh.
All of you, hear me loud and clear.
You owe me every single interest
and involvement of yours.
You will owe me by
stocking my repository.
Agnimukh, they say..
A warrior caste until
paying it's debts doesn't
deserve liberation.
So, stock my gold repository
to pay your debts.
Fulfill your purpose
as a warrior caste.
But, Lord,
why did he flee in the first place
if he really was your well-wisher?
Why did not he reveal himself?
Who might it be?
Regardless he said,
we will meet again.
At this point in time it
is secondary to find out my saviour.
I need to know who
plotted my death instead.
'Alert! Cut top knot came
as a serpent to kill you.'
'The result is obvious.'
'His missing plait.'
'You did it on your own, didn't you?'
Amatya Rakshas is a scholar And
a scholar cannot
belittle his knowledge.
But, I'm Seleucus
the Emperor of Macedonia.
I will not tolerate an attack on me.
For a guerilla war we
will reciprocate likewise.
Stab in the back and be
ready to be stabbed in the back.
And the attack will be tactful
enough not to put me in the limelight
but the one who is the reason
of Amatya's top knot being cut.
Right now,
King Dhananand's biggest rival
is Advisor Chanakya.
Kill him.
Careful, Amatya.
'If I want,
I can kill all of you here.'
'But my aim is not to
kill but to follow you all'
'to who has sent you here so the
next phase of my plan can start.'
All my valiant warriors!
Show your skills!
Because the best of the warriors
will fulfill my dream of
capturing those 15 districts.
Come forward!
Sire! Sire! Sire!
Things have taken a bad turn!
There is trouble!
I'd told you all that
after killing Amatya
you all should get out of Magadh.
- What are you doing here?
- Sire, we were going
to kill him but that
slave of Dhananand came there.
Who was it?
- Chandragupta?
- Yes.
He saved Amatya.
Oh, God! He is a close
associate of Dhananand.
Seeing me with all of you
that slave understood everything.
He will now send
the message to Dhananand
that it was me who
tried to kill Amatya!
My political ties with
Dhananand are over now!
My dream to capture
this country will shatter.
Bring my horse.
I will have to do
something about it!
It is not viable to become
an enemy of Dhananand.
Amatya!
Who did this to you?
Your Highness,
I do not know who they were.
Amatya, I am not happy
with your recent work
because every time
you have disappointed me.
But not taking
the attack on you seriously
is impossible.
Attacking you means attacking me.
Who can it be who is
attacking my dear ones?
First, it was Durdhara..
Then Bhadrasaal's mother and now..
Now my dear advisor.
Who is that person
who is right under my nose
but I am not able to catch him?
Slave, Amatya told me that you
saved him from the
attackers and followed them.
Tell me.
Who had sent them?
- It was..
- Be alert!
King Seleucus is arriving!
Even my dear friend Seleucus is here.
All of a sudden what made
you come to my court, Seleucus?
I heard somebody attacked Amatya.
I thought of enquiring
about his well-being.
Emperor, if you ever need
any help please do notify me.
After all, we are friends now.
Attacking one of your near ones
means you have been
indirectly attacked.
Who is that criminal?
Whoever it is he is stupid, Seleucus.
That's because my favourite slave
Chandragupta had followed them.
He is about to tell me
who the perpetrator is.
Tell me, Chandragupta.
Who is that person?
- Emperor.. - I agree that
he is your favourite slave.
But after all, he is a mere slave.
That too, he is a child.
It would not be right
to blindly trust him.
You yourself should
look into the matter.
If young boys from Macedonia
can strategise a battle, then
why cannot our boys from Magadh
follow the killers
and get them caught, King Seleucus?
You have to agree with what
Amatya just said, Seleucus..
Because many times,
he has proven himself.
My dear slave..
Speak up!
Who was it?
Your Highness
those killers
were disciples of Chanakya.
The proof is their
appearance and clothes.
'This slave knows that it
was me who conspired to kill Amatya.'
'But why did this
slave not take my name?'
Your Highness,
we have confined Chanakya.
So to take vengeance
those disciples had attacked Amatya.
Emperor, I even followed
them to take them as prisoners
but please forgive me..
They escaped.
Forgive me, Seleucus..
But I do not need your help.
The murderers this
slave is talking about..
Their teacher is in my prison.
So, I'll handle the situation.
Thank you for your
concern and sympathy.
Now go and strategise
the combined attack that
is going to be held the 15 districts.
Slave, come with me.
I'll tell you about our next step.
Yes, Your Highness.
Slave.
You keep on pleasing me
with new and advanced things.
But this time you failed
to break his silence.
You said that you can anticipate
what's going on in his mind.
And can see the greed hidden
in his mind regarding my wealth.
But you couldn't succeed yet.
So I've decided
that this time when you
will go to interact with him
I'll hear your conversations
from an adjacent room.
To decide that what's
lacking in your initiative.
Sure, Your Highness.
So, this time I am going to
observehow you extract the truth from
Chanakya.
And what are the processes
that you are adopting in reality?
Look at me, you wicked Brahmin.
'Dhananand is standing
just behind this door.'
'He is listening to us.'
'I have initiated the
task that you've assigned me.'
'I attacked Seleucus.'
'And in a way'
'that the suspicion is on Amatya.'
'And when he attacked Amatya
in order to take revenge'
'I saved Amatya.'
'And by not revealing
the truth of Seleucus'
'I'll definitely earn his
trust and friendship as well.'
'What else did Seleucus say?'
'Nothing yet.'
'But I am confident'
'that my plan will be successful.'
Start the interrogation, slave.
Even though you speak a lot
but now when I'm willing
to hear you speak
you are completely silent.
'I can't see you'
'like this anymore, sir.'
'I'll get you out of here.
As soon as possible.'
Only a sound?
'You are more stubborn than I am.'
'Go and wait for
Seleucus's signals.'
I'm leaving for now
but I'll break your silence very soon
you wicked Brahmin with an open hair.
So that was your plan?
As you went inside,
both of you remained silent
no one uttered a word.
The only thing that I could hear in
all this while is just a random sound.
Was there some mute performance?
Calm down, Your Highness.
I was silent because
I was waiting for him to speak.
But he is very stubborn.
If he was silent,
then you have this sword.
A lot of tough guys
falter in front of this.
Why didn't you use it?
If his silence could
be broken with torture
he would have spoken by now.
That is why I'm telling you
to let me do the job my own way.
And then if I feel that
I will not succeed in my work
in that case you
have the sword already.
Your Highness!
Mother has regained consciousness.
What?
Why are you standing there, slave?
Come with me.
Let's go and figure
out who attacked her.
The most deadly attack of this
universe comes from our tongue.
That is our words.
Because a blow with the
weapon can kill our enemies
or make them handicapped.
But the blow of our
strong and harsh words
will not kill our enemies
but the monster of revenge
will take birth in their mind.
Which can be deadly for us.
That's why do not lose control
over your tongue, even in anger.
My ethics..
Your destiny.
Tell me who is the one who is
among us and betraying us. Speak up.
Chandragupta!

================================================================================

Episode: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2b3q6-v96Ss

Say something, Ma'am.
I know you still have the strength.
Please try.
Look my condition without you.
First, my wealth was stolen
then you had a fall
from such great height
and finally an attack on Amatya.
All this can't be a coincidence,
this is a conspiracy.
I know that you are
aware of the conspiracy.
Please tell me, Ma'am.
Tell me who is the one who
is among us and betraying us.
Please give it a try, Ma'am.
You are strong enough. You can do it.
'After Dhananand's end,
the entire united India'
'will have only one ruler,
only one emperor.'
'Piplivan's crown prince,
Chandragupta Maurya.'
Brother?
He is the eldest brother, Ma'am.
It isn't me, my lord.
I came here just now.
No, Brother. It isn't me.
Calm down, Brother. Calm!
You needn't worry, as she
couldn't point correctly today.
But I'm confident that she will
will recover soon
and identify the traitor.
'Grandma's health is improving.'
'She may recover soon.'
'I don't have much time to spare.'
'Chanakya has asked me
to wait for Selucus's signal.'
'I wonder if it may be late.'
My coach, you trained me in yoga
so that I can build up courage
and can keep myself calm.
But with every passing moment,
I'm becoming impatient.
The full moon night
is about to appear.
You are held a prisoner.
Grandma is recovering.
But you have asked me
to wait for Selucus's signal.
Why is it so, my mentor?
May I know the reason for this attack.
Our friendship started this way itself
so refreshed the same.
Please excuse me,
this is my yoga time.
I think we have a lot of similarities.
Because we, the people of
Macedonia also worship the sun.
Come on let's start
this new relationship
by worshipping the Sun God together.
May I know what are
you praying God for?
Dhananand's end!
Enemy's enemy is a friend.
So come on,
as friends let's join hands
so that we can finish Dhananand.
Why is Emperor's reliable
servant praying along with Selucus?
It's good that your journey
has been great so far.
You saved me from the snake
sent by Amatya and safeguarded
my secret from Dhananand.
But will this be
sufficient to trust you
as you are Dhananand's loyal servant.
I can't trust you so easily.
Yes, you shouldn't trust easily.
But I have something
that can clear your doubts.
What can a servant have
which can please Macedonia's king?
If a loyal servant turns out
to be a friend he can be very helpful.
Friendship's first lesson! Trust!
Something is fishy.
I have to inform
the Emperor immediately.
This is Dhananand's stolen treasure.
How is it with you?
Why?
Are you still doubtful
about this servant's ability?
Did you steal it?
But how?
You're just an ordinary servant
and just a kid.
You aren't successful
always when you go deeper
you may get stuck in the marsh below.
So without going to
the root of the matter
just understand that when
I can get you here secretly
I can finish Dhananand as well.
You mean to say all
this wealth belongs to me?
Had this not been so you wouldn't
have been here, King Seleucus.
But beware.
If Dhananand somehow
even gets a whiff of it
then I shall somehow
find a way out but you..
You may definitely get into trouble.
Dhananand shall definitely
not get a whiff of it.
What is the hurry, King Seleucus?
If I have given you such
a big proof of trustworthiness
then how can I believe just like that
that you will not
betray me for Dhananand?
What do you want?
Freedom.
Freedom of Acharya Chanakya
who is Dhananand's captive.
What?
Do not be surprised.
There is no trade
bigger than friendship.
Give and take.
If you want this deal
then you will have to help me.
You have to put your
hands in Dhananand's pit
in order to free Acharya Chanakya.
So my favourite slave
was talking to Seleucus?
Yes, Your Majesty.
Our spy could not hear their talks
but he saw them shaking
hands and offering prayers.
After that both of
them left from that place.
Our spies even tried to follow them
but those two were successful
in giving them a slip.
Three drops of this lethal poison
are enough to put
you to sleep forever.
Go and bring my dear cockroach.
As you command, Your Majesty.
My dear slave
you always surprise me. Now
what are you planning with Seleucus.
I am curious to know that.
So did you understand the plan?
There is risk but in exchange
there is so much reward as well.
You mission is definitely risky
but it is also not impossible.
I shall wait for you at the palace.
As soon you enter the palace
it shall be my duty to bring
Acharya Chanakya to this wall.
But you have to ensure
that my people shall prepare
the path under my direction.
And shall come to the
other side of this wall.
As soon this wall falls
Acharya Chanakya shall be free.
And then..
Our friendship shall be even stronger.
Amazing!
Unbelievable!
Greetings, Your Majesty!
Come, slave.
Do you know today I am astonished.
I heard you met my friend Seleucus?
A man consider himself smart
but remains oblivious of
what is happening around him.
So many surprising things
take place every day.
Take this liquid for instance.
It does not look it can harm anyone
but death lies inside it.
I don't know why I
feel like using it on you.
I shall kill you using this.
You met my friend Seleucus.
What did you two discuss about?
I am eager to know about it.
Yes, Your Highness. We two met.
But I just wanted to help you.
You wanted to help me.
Well, of course you do.
But I want to know
how will you help me.
When Amatya's strategy
failed before Seleucus's
since then this thought
has been driving me restless
that now Seleucus
will have a upper hand
against those republics
in the mission and not you.
He will definitely lead Magadh
but he will try every now and then
to demean you, Your Majesty.
He will keep trying to command over
not just the Magadhan
army rather you as well.
Hence, I thought
we should do something
by which he shall stay in control.
And you made Seleucus
believe that you are his friend
so that you can stay in his side
but be my eyes and ears!
- Is that not so?
- Undoubtedly, Your Majesty.
Seleucus will think I am his spy
but I am working for you.
Amazing!
Once again you made me
happy with you job, Chandragupta.
You have my permission
to carry on your mission.
Do something so that Seleucus
stays under Magadh's.. My feet!
'Seleucus shall see his place later'
'but first I shall definitely
show you your place.'
'The mission has started anyway,
Dhananand.'
You think so much about me, slave.
Hence, you must also get
the reward for your loyalty.
Hence, I have thought
I shall help you with the
responsibility given to you.
I did not understand, Your Majesty.
I am thinking about Chanakya.
I believe you must have interrogated
him in every manner possible
to find out about my treasury but..
But you could not
crack him yet, hence..
I have prepared this
special decoction.
The one who drinks this always
speaks the truth and nothing else.
We shall administer
this decoction to Chanakya
and find out about my treasury.
Come on, Chandragupta.
My favourite slave shall administer
this decoction to Chanakya.
Come.
'Seleucus must be on his
way to free Acharya Chanakya.'
'What if after having this decoction'
'Acharya tells about
our whole plan to Dhananand?'
What is it, slave?
Why did you stop?
You must feed this
decoction to Chanakya.
And I shall watch from afar.
An elephant has separate
teeth to show and to eat.
You must all have
heard about this saying.
The established meaning of this is
that we should not show off
But..
We get one more thing
to learn from this saying.
This is true
that an elephants outer
tusk cannot help him eat
but their huge size
and strong image
strike fear in the enemy.
They keep it away from the elephant.
Hence, never let your enemy see any
degradation in your strength.
Stay safe.
Keep in mind.
Before your enemy
your biggest weapon
is his fear of your strength.
My ethics..
Your destiny.
Because whoever will
try to break this wall
a dense smoke will come out from it.
It will kill that person
then and there itself.

================================================================================

Episode: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZXycMtm3Eo

Take this.
This will relieve your pain.
Your king comes here
to inflict wounds on me
and then, you come here to heal them.
Your king causes pain to me
and you try to relieve it.
I understand this game
of your king and you.
You think that you
can talk to me sweetly
and convince me to tell
you about Dhananand's treasure.
But that is impossible.
Consume this.
'This makes a person tell the truth.'
'You please don't say anything.'
'Or else, our plan will get ruined.'
You don't have to talk so much.
I am the reason why
you are still alive.
Come on. Drink it.
He had it..
Very good..
He had that special drink.
So, Your Highness
will he start talking the truth now?
No.
Because there is no
such drink in this world
which can make a
person speak the truth.
But some drinks can
surely kill people.
And that's what will
happen with this wicked man.
I had made this mixture of
poison and snake venom specially
to kill you, Chanakya.
Stop! Follow me.
The secret chamber starts from here.
It will take you to the dungeon
where Chanakya is confined.
And yes
be here until I open the door.
And make sure
nobody finds you entering
this secret chamber. Did you got it?
King, what did you do?
We should save him.
Why?
Because he is the only one
who knows about your secret treasure.
You cannot kill him.
Of course, I can.
That is why I killed him.
You should understand this.
This stubborn man
was not going to reveal it ever.
That is why I silenced him for life.
I will surely find
my treasure one day.
But, at least,
I will not be having this fear now
that he might give it to someone
who would possibly use it against me.
Am I right, Chanakya?
Now he will die.
Because the poison has
started showing its effect.
It is the end of Chanakya's chapter.
Your Highness
Seleucus is here to meet you.
Oh! Seleucus.
I should not keep him wait.
Servant, please be with him
until he breaths his last.
There must be someone around him
during the final moments of his life.
Right?
I trust you more than I trust anyone.
Acharya.. You cannot die.
I-I will not let
anything happen to you.
Hold on. I will do something.
Acharya..
I will bring the medicine right now.
Oh, God!
Did you not consume it?
Thank God that you did not.
Acharya, you did not consume it.
They why..
The moment I tasted it
I came to know that it is poison.
I kept preventing it from
going inside my stomach
through a breathing trick
and locked it inside my throat.
Yet, some of it went inside.
I do not have much time, Chandragupta.
No, this is not possible.
There must be a medicine which can
bring down the effect of this poison.
You know everything.
You are knowledgeable.
You know everything.
Tell me.
Yes.
There is a plant in Kehenvan.
The juice of its leaves
work as its antidote.
But the problem is
only I can recognise that plant.
I am very closer to my death,
Chandragupta.
Acharya, do you not trust me?
I have made plans
to get you out of here.
Seleucus is here for that as well.
He is helping us.
What are you doing, Chandragupta?
Acharya, I promised to you
that I would not let you stay here.
Now come with me.
I will give you medicine
and you will be all right
and Seleucus will advance
with the plan, Acharya..
Acharya..
'So I will have to turn
the wheel on the throne'
'to open the door.'
Welcome, my friend, Seleucus.
Well, how is the planning
for the war coming along?
Very well.
I am here to talk to you about that.
I was wondering how to secure
your palace when both
of us ride for the war.
These days, everyone wants to help me.
Dhananand
I will tell you about
holes in your security.
So I request that you do
not I am trying to humiliate you.
Instead, respect our station
and sit down on your throne
and listen to me carefully.
Of course!
I love my throne!
I love sitting on my throne
sit above everyone
and look down on everyone.
It is the greatest feeling!
The guards are shifting, Acharya.
The guards of a different
shift will be here soon.
We will have to leave soon.
We have to go to the wall
where your freedom awaits you.
Just 30 steps more, Acharya.
Gather your strength, Acharya.
We can reach that place.
Gather your strength.
I have explained the plan to Seleucus.
His men will be entering
the secret tunnel
hidden under the palace.
The tunnel that opens with turning
the wheel in Dhananand's throne.
This is the best liquor of Magadh.
No..
A friend takes things from his friend
with the right hand.
But let this be for later.
Let us talk about work first.
Chandragupta, because of me
you have put yourself in great danger.
I do not have much time.
Yes..
You know everything, right?
You have answer to everything, right?
But now you are not to say anything.
Only I will speak.
You are not to order me around now.
You are to obey my orders.
Acharya..
Acharya..
Acharya..
Acharya..
Acharya..
Acharya..
If not for yourself..
At least to fulfill
your dream of an united India..
Acharya..
Make effort, Acharya..
Or else you will
not have much time left.
Acharya!
Make effort.
I think the security of
this part of the palaceis weak.
Someone might make a
tunnel here and get inside.
This is the first camp
the person will have to cross.
This is where you have
made arrangements for security.
You have towers from which
you can keep an eye on everyone.
But that is not enough
because the security is
not as activeas it should be.
Just as an intruder
crosses this chamber
and reaches this chamber,
which is really a trap.
No, my friend..
It is not a web made
up of any ordinary material.
It's each and every wire is
made up of glass which is poisonous.
Whoever will touch them
will immediately die.
Still, Your Majesty.
If anyone is an expert athlete
then he can easily cross
it with his flexible body.
And if at all someone
crosses this area
then he will need to break this wall.
And it will not be difficult
for any strong person
And here,
he will then enter the third area.
Dhananand!
You should be worried
and you are smiling.
Friend, I am laughing
because whoever gained
this much of knowledge for you
has not considered my intelligence.
Because whoever will
try to break this wall
a dense smoke will come out from it.
It will kill that person
then and there itself.
You do not need to
worry at all, friend.
Because your friend
is not weak and foolish at all.
Absolutely not,
friend In fact, you are
my strongest and the dearest friend.
And I can fulfill my dream
of acquiring 15 districts
by uniting a special friend like you.
So, my dear friend. Stop worrying.
And drink liquor.
Twenty one! Twenty two!
A little more courage, sir!
A little more effort!
What kind of smell is this?
Chandragupta!
This is very deadly poison!
Close it quickly!
Whoever might be coming from
this path must have died by now!
What!
That means,
Seleucus's plan has failed!
Close it!
- Acharya..
- Chandragupta.
Yes.
I-I told you!
I am about to die!
Now, just..
You have to fulfill
my dream now!
Do not forget, Chandragupta!
This is a battle for truth!
I-It is now your battle.
Chandragupta, this..
Acharya..
No.
This cannot be.
You cannot go by leaving
your dream of united India behind.
Many animals and birds attack a tree.
Woodpecker attacks the branch
using its beak continuously.
Elephant rubs its body on the tree
using its complete strength.
And the bear attacks it to get honey.
But any of their attacks
cannot make the tree fall.
While a small termite destroys
a tree right from its root.
Have you ever thought
that how a small termite
becomes successful
in finishing the
existence of a huge tree?
Because the termite does
not attack the tree from the outside
but it attacks from the inside.
That is why always stay safe
from the attacks on the inside.
No matter how strong you are
do not let your weakness
come in front of your enemy.
And always keep an
eye on your security system
so that no one tries to break into it.
My ethics..
Your destiny.
'Dhananad, I am coming
to take revenge for master Chanakya.'
'Now you and your tyranny
will come to an end.'
Come, servant.

================================================================================

Episode: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9COoQnWiIY

Chandragupta, remember this.
This is the battle
of good against the evil.
It is now your battle.
Chandragupta this..
Acharya..
No.
This is not possible.
You cannot go away from
your dream of united Bharat.
There are no soldiers deployed here.
If Bhadrasaal gets to know
that none of us are in our position
we will lose our job.
Oh, God! What do I do now?
Acharya?
- Chandragupta.
- Yes?
I told you
that I do not have much time.
But
it is also my duty to ensure
that my dream of a united
Bharat does not end with me.
Chandragupta
you are the only one
who can fulfill my dream.
Promise me
that you will relieve your motherland
from the atrocities of Dhananand
and lead it towards the freedom.
Promise me..
No, Acharya.
Nothing will happen to you.
No, Chandragupta.
I do not want to hear anything.
This is the only
assurance I want from you.
Promise me that you will
safeguard your motherland.
No, Acharya.
I cannot promise you this.
Because I want you to
be alive and witness your dream
of a united Bharat getting fulfillled.
You have been after this from so long.
That is the reason
why I could see a
bright future of Bharat.
Or else, I always had this thought
that your dream of a united Bharat
is just your illusion.
But after seeing your determination
towards our motherland
every bit of me is ready
to dedicate itself from
the freedom for my motherland.
I, Chandragupta Maurya
consider my motherland
as the witness and vow
that I will fulfill your dream
of a united Bharat.
From this very moment
your dream of a united
Bharat will be mine.
I will become a hope of the millions
and the dispeller of injustice
the epitome of revolution..
From this very moment, I vow
that I will not be at peace, until
I fulfill your dream
of a united Bharat.
"The sun of the united Bharat.."
"Chandragupta Maurya.."
Bless me, Acharya.
"Chandragupta Maurya.."
"Chandragupta Maurya.."
"Chandragupta Maurya..
Chandragupta Maurya.."
But I am directionless
without your guidance.
So, I will surely get
you released from here.
No matter what..
You will not be doing that alone,
Chandragupta.
Your friends and I are with you.
Mother?
You cannot take him out of here alone.
It is important for us to help you.
Chandra, just tell me
what we are supposed to do.
Mother, the main doors
of the palace must be shut now.
We have to take him
out from some other way.
You are here in this
palace since years.
You must be knowing an alternate way
through which we can take him out.
Try to recall, Mother.
There must be a way.
The laundry area.
- What?
- Yes.
There is a drainage
in the laundry area
from where the waste
water of the palace goes out.
All right, Mother!
Indra, Sthul, Dhum, me and you
will take Chanakya
away from right under
the nose of Dhananand.
This is my plan.
Oh! Chanakya is dead!
What!
Is Chanakya no more?
Do you not understand this?
Go to the dead body.
Meanwhile, I will inform the king.
And yes, make sure you
keep an eye on the dead body.
It's Emperor's order.
Hurry up. Go soon!
Your Highness, I have a good news.
That stubborn Brahman,
Chanakya, is dead.
He did not die, servant.
He has been punished.
It was impossible for him to survive
after consuming that poison
which I made to punish him.
'I hope Indra and Sthul have
not faced any obstruction so far'
'any they have completed their task.'
Oh, God!
He died in a horrible condition.
That is what this traitor deserved.
- He is a traitor..
- He is a traitor..
Look!
Look! Whatever he did in his lifetime
is now a history.
But the person who
is dead now is a Brahman
and we should give him all
the honours which he deserves.
I think we should
perform his last rites.
Or else
all of us will bear
the sin of killing a Brahman
and we will be sent to the purgatory.
He is right..
Yes.
Let us change his dirty clothes first.
He is still a traitor for us.
If you are so bothered about him
go, perform his last
rites and change his clothes.
We will not stop you.
Okay!
Someone must do this.
So we will do it.
Yes..
Are you ready?
Hold on for some more time.
Because Chandra will
not let you die so soon.
If I have decided to kill anybody
nobody can save that person from me.
'And I will make sure I save Acharya,
Dhananand.'
If I have decided to kill anybody
nobody can save that person from me.
Well done, Your Majesty.
I am totally impressed by you.
Every step taken by you towards
Chanakya was very quick and effective.
Seleucus, the question is
not about influencing anybody here.
The question is about
setting an example
and conveying a message to everybody
that this is what
will happen to anybody
who has an evil intention towards
Dhananand's treasure and his throne.
Stop worrying now, Seleucus.
You might have realised by now
that I am capable enough
to solve my problems.
Come on, Servant.
Take me to Chanakya's dead body.
I am very eager to see him dead.
Your wish is my command, Your Majesty.
I am sorry, Chandragupta.
I wish I could do something for you.
You can help me even now.
Come, Servant.
Yes, Your Majesty.
'I will free Acharya
Chanakya from here on my own.'
'To help me,
you just have to come to the room'
'where I will be
present with Dhananand.'
What is your motive, Chandragupta?
What is happening here?
Where is Chanakya?
Your Majesty, we thought
of changing his dirty clothes
and making him wear
clean clothes of a Brahmin.
- That is why..
- Brahmin clothes?
He does not deserve any such respect.
Remove this!
Indra..
Indra.. Stulbhadra..
Friends, what happened to you?
But they were changing his clothes?
He is alive.
Chanakya is alive!
Close all the doors of the palace.
I want that wicked Brahmin.
Every plan of that servant
is succeeding, Amatya.
What happened, Amatya?
This armour was in the centre,
Bhadrasaal.
Somebody has entered
the tunnel using this.
'Your Majesty, those murderers
were Chanakya's disciples.'
Chanakya.
Somebody has tried to free Chanakya.
Why is he going to the washermen's
area with the rest of the maids?
He is a royal servant.
What work does he have over there?
This must be Chandragupta's new plan.
He is up to something.
Your Majesty, we do not know anything.
We were just changing his clothes.
Yes, Your Majesty.
I just remember
that I was hit strongly on the head
and I fainted, Your Majesty.
Your Majesty, we searched
every corner of the palace.
There is no clue about Chanakya.
Did he become smoke and fly?
He is in the palace.
Bring him!
'Dhumketu must be reaching
the washermen's area with Acharya.'
Friend Dhananand.
What is the matter?
There is a lot of chaos.
Has something happened here?
No, Friend.
Nothing as such has happened.
I keep making my army work harder
to increase my security arrangements.
And you also told me
that we are proceeding towards wars.
So, our security arrangements
should be strong.
Isn't it?
But I have heard some guards
saying to close the doors.
I have also heard that
somebody has run away from here.
I had announced this.
This is a security drill
and my security guards are perfect
and honest towards their duties.
Their rehearsal also
makes it feel like it is real.
Do not worry.
Everything is under control.
Instead, I am eager
to proceed as per your plan.
Go to your room
and make arrangements
for the next move.
Sure.
I will make a move now.
Wait, Seleucus.
Along with being my guest,
you are my best friend too.
If I am not able
to drop you to your room
my dear servant will come to drop you.
- Servant.
- Your wish is my command.
Listen to me.
It is your duty to ensure
that he goes directly
to his chariot from here.
He should not learn what
is happening in the palace.
Your wish is my command, Your Majesty.
Brother.
Brother.
I heard that Chanakya ran away.
Talk softly.
Walls have ears too
and enemies have many ears.
Brother, I saw Chanakya's friend going
towards the washermen's
area a little while ago
when he has no work there.
This is your only help that I wanted.
Thank you very much.
Brother, give me just one chance.
Just one chance.
I will prove that
Chandragupta has tried
to help Chanakya in running away.
If our support is taken away
from us all of a sudden
or we lose it
it feels as though there
is a darkness of problems.
Do not lose hope during such moments.
Have control over
your organs and emotions.
Try to find a solution.
You will find the
solution on your own.
My ethics..
Your destiny.

================================================================================

Episode: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LE5t2JeHT5g

Brother, just a while ago,
I saw that servant
Chandragupta's friend,
going towards the laundry bay.
He does not have any work there.
Brother, just give me a chance.
Just a chance.
I will prove that Chandragupta
has tried to whisk Chanakya away.
I only needed this much help from you.
Thank you very much.
Stop.
Where is the king?
He has gone towards
the laundry bay, Amatya.
Come, Bhadrasaal.
Acharya! Acharya, are you okay?
Come, Acharya.
Oh! Great King Dhananand.
I have heard that your best
and most dear enemy Acharya Chanakya
the one who stole your
treasure has escaped.
He escaped from under your
nose staining your reputation.
I do not have time for your
wretched conversation right now.
I know!
You do not even want to listen to me.
Do you know why? Because
I always speak truth in front of you
and show you your proper place.
Sometimes,
what I say becomes the truth.
That Chanakya vowed to destroy you.
'The top knot you have insulted today'
'I vow, with this
top knot as my witness'
'that I will destroy your
Nand dynasty utterly 'Dhananand!'
'I will dethrone you and
put a worthy ruler on this throne.'
He will not die.
He will fulfill his vow.
God would have to help him now.
Did you forget?
You yourself arranged
for a Mahamrityunjaya
mantra recitation ceremony
for Chanakya, King Dhananand.
Are you finished, Mura?
Move!
'I hope I have given you
sufficient time, Chandragupta'
'with which you have safely taken,
Acharya out of the palace.'
'I have to put that grid back on.'
There is nothing here, Brother!
Look, Brother.
This water is still moving.
I am talking about Chanakya and
you are pointing towards the water!
Now I am thinking
that I should have given
some of the poison
I gave Chanakya to you.
But never mind.
That poison failed
to affect Chanakya too.
Let us get out of here!
Wait, Your Highness!
Look at this.
Look, Your Highness.
Chanakya's necklace!
That means, Chanakya has
escaped using this water resource.
And that servant has helped him.
Acharya!
Just a little longer, Acharya!
We will soon reach the jungle.
And then we will find the
cure for your poison, Acharya.
Just hold on.
I will not let anything happen to you.
Let us go.
I will go inside this
tunnel and catch them.
That is not necessary, Brother.
They would have closed the other end.
Brother, servant Dhumketu
cannot do this alone.
His friend must be
helping him in this task.
And you know who that friend is.
Chandragupta!
Your Majesty, somebody has tried
to help Chanakya escape
through the tunnel.
This means, brother was right.
This has not been done by one person.
Go and bring them to me.
Chanakya!
They would not have gone very far.
Follow these footprints
and bring them to me.
Come on, Acharya. Come on.
We have reached there.
Little more patience.
I do not think
that we can leave safely from here.
Only one of us can survive.
My condition is deteriorating.
You go. Go from here.
Remember my pledge.
Go from here
before Dhananand becomes suspicious
due to your absence.
- Go.
- Wait here.
I will definitely find
a way out or a solution.
Acharya. Do not worry, Acharya.
I will be back.
There he is. Come on, catch him.
'I hope Chandra and
Acharya have left safely.'
Acharya!
Acharya!
Acharya, open your eyes.
Acharya, you had told me
that the juice of this plant
will work as a medicine
for this poison
and it will show its affect very soon.
Open your eyes, then, Acharya.
Acharya..
Oh, God!
I will have to call
a physician very soon.
Acharya, be patient.
I will be back, okay?
Patience!
Patience is an important virtue.
If it is used in the right way
the fruit will be sweet
and it will give great joy.
But unfortunately, I have to say
that you still need to have patience.
Acharya, you are in sound health!
How do I look like?
You are looking perfectly
all right, Acharya!
Believe me..
Never before your knowledge
sounded so sweet to me.
Then get ready
because now I will be departing
a lot of knowledge to you
which will help you in an effective
way in your rebellious battle.
And that starts right
from this moment!
Right now? At this moment?
Acharya, we just got
out of serious trouble..
You just got out
of the jaws of death..
- And you say..
- Acharya!
Chandragupta! Chandragupta!
- Your friend Dhumketu..
- What happened to him?
Dhananand has held him
captive as he has been accused
of conspiring to help Acharya escape.
What!
Chandragupta!
I very well know what you're thinking
and what your next
course of action will be.
But this is not the time to get
carried away and do something stupid.
You need to do things patiently.
Acharya, the life
of my friend is in danger
because he was helping me.
Now, I can only think
of saving his life
and nothing else!
Chandragupta!
Look at this image
very carefully, slave.
I will be slitting
your throat from here.
According to this manual
if the cut is made at this
juncture with a very sharp object
the victim experiences
excruciating pain.
And this work of mine
will be done by this razor.
In fact, the work
of a razor is to cut hair
but today, in the history of Magadh
this will give you a ghastly,
painful death!
By the way,
this razor is more lucky than you
because you lived
your life as a slave.
And now, you have earned
a name as a traitor.. Or shall I say
you are unlucky to get that name?
In fact, the work
of a razor is to cut hair
but today, in the history of Magadh
this will give you a ghastly,
painful death!
Death to the traitor!
Death to the traitor!
Death to the traitor!
Death to the traitor!
Death to the traitor!
Death to the traitor!
Death to the traitor!
Death to the traitor!
Dhumketu is innocent!
It is me who freed Chanakya, Emperor.
A man's life is like this wet mud
and it is like this wheel..
The circle of life.
It goes on revolving
and never stops for anyone.
And just like this wet mud,
life gets its shape
with only one help..
Your hands..
This means the work you do..
It is one's duty which
changes the present
and carves out the future.
So, do not waste time
in thinking what happened in the past.
Focus what is going
to happen in the future.
Only then will life be successful.
My ethics..
Your destiny.
Your Majesty, I did all that.
- Punish me all you want..
- Shut up..
You do not have to beg for punishment.
Because you will get punishment.

================================================================================

Episode: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lirHVx7dGZg

He is innocent!
Your Majesty, I freed Chanakya.
It was my plan, Your Majesty
I admit my crime in front of everyone.
I made the plan of freeing Chanakya.
That is why he is wearing that!
It is because I told him
to distract the soldiers
so that I could take
Chanakya out easily.
You know the truth now, Your Majesty.
Not even Amatya and his
spies could find Chanakya.
At that time, I found him.
I found him twice without
any help or any army.
And everyone here knows that
Chanakya is as good as an army.
Right, Amatya?
You must agree with me, right?
You think about it.
How could I have take him captive?
It is because he
was with me in the plan.
It was all his plan.
Then I brought him to you..
And when you tried to kill him,
I made sure to empty your treasure.
Yes, to save him.
And then I took your
permission to interrogate him.
And using that, I planned his escape.
And he is free now!
Yes..
Your Majesty, that..
Actually, Chandra,
your friend has already admitted
that he helped Chanakya.
He also said that just
as you find out about the truth
you will say such things to save him.
I will tell you the truth, Slave.
If your friend had
not accepted his crime
I would have placed the blade
on your neck and not his.
Why are you doing this!
- Why are you lying!
- I will tell you.
He is a traitor but
also a good friend.
He knows he has taken
advantage of your friendship.
And now that he can see his death
he wants to be free of betraying you.
He wants to be of
the guilt that hurts him.
No, Your Majesty,
he did not betray me.
- I am just..
- Shut up now,Chandra!
Stop supporting him.
For how long will you help you?
You should have severed
all ties with him
when he showed
his greed before Indra.
But no, you are forgiving, right?
What are you saying?
He is right!
You know everything, Chandra!
When I was given
a job in the royal treasury
Dhumketu had come there that day.
Do you remember what he said?
That we should take
some money from ourselves.
Nothing of the sort happened!
Shut up, Chandra!
Lying is not going to change anything.
You know that is what happened!
You are very compassionate
and idealistic.
Only because of you,
I could never fulfill my greed.
I got distracted.
I would have money right
in front of me but because of you..
Only because of you
I could never have it.
So I befriended Chanakya.
But if I had not gotten caught today
I would have gotten my share
from the money I stole from Dhananand.
And I would have gone far from you
and everyone else!
I found the coins
from your friend.
These are from the treasure
Chanakya had stolen.
These prove that Chanakya
and your friend were working together.
He got greedy for money
and helped Chanakya to escape.
How could you go so far?
Chandra has done so much for us.
He freed us from slavery.
He brought us to the royal palace.
And you could not control your greed.
Your Majesty, please listen to me.
I did all that.
- Punish me all you want..
- Shut up..
You do not have to beg for punishment.
Because you will get punishment.
Something that will remind
you that you are to be loyal
only to me and no one else.
Not your parents, siblings or friends.
The punishment
will be worse than death sentence.
Dhumketu will get death
sentence with this blade.
He will get it just as I order it.
I will not punish him, though.
You will kill him, Chandragupta.
Take this.
You made the mistake of
bringing him into the palace.
You did the mistake
of believing in him blindly.
And now, it is the
time for you to pay for it.
Chandragupta,
make sure you kill your friend
your friend and engrave those moments
in your mind forever.
Because that will keep reminding you
that you should only
be faithful to your master
and that you should
not trust on anyone
other than trusting on yourself.
What are you waiting for?
Finish this traitor!
If you do not kill your friend today
I will take it as
your sympathy towards him
and of your friends too.
Now the decision is yours.
Either kill Dhumketu
or put the lives of even
your other friends at stake.
Either kill Dhumketu
or put the lives of even
your other friends at stake.
Fine.
If that is your decision,
then so be it!
I will kill him first.
No!
Finish the task soon.
I knew that I would see this day.
That is why I had vowed to ensure
that I do not let your plan fail.
Go ahead, kill me.
Friend, why are you
sacrificing your life for me?
I was an ordinary servant, Chandra.
But after being with you
I got this chance of becoming
a part of your journey
towards your aim of becoming
the emperor of the united Bharat.
And now
I have got this golden chance
of getting martyred for my motherland.
And you are still
asking me why I did this?
Chandra, I am doing this
because I believe in you.
I can see that
you will become our future
emperor Chandragupta Maurya.
I did all this to fulfill that dream.
Promise me, my friend. No matter what
you will establish
yourself on this throne
and fulfill the dream
of a united Bharat.
Promise me, Chandra. Promise me.
Good!
Good!
Very good!
You did not let your friendship
come in the path of justice.
This is what I had expected from you.
Very good!
'This stupid servant's
punishment does not end here.'
'I will use his dead
body as an example.'
'I will show to the world'
'what happens to the people
when they are alive and after
they die if they betray Magadh.'
'He is dead.
But his punishment is still pending.'
'Every person who passes by
this area will throw stones at him.'
'Hit him.'
- Chandra..
- Queen.
Leave him alone for some time.
Let him be all by himself.
Please return to the palace
before anybody in the palace
senses your absence.
- But, Acharya..
- Trust me with him.
The future king of a united
India is mourning right now.
He is in grief.
But I will not let him
be like this for a long time.
Go without any worries.
'You guys cannot even
hold a rope properly.'
'Who put me down?
This happened due to this fatso.'
'Dhumketu will definitely get a
death sentence with this very razor.'
'It will be done just
as I had mentioned.'
'But I will not punish him.'
'You will punish him, Chandragupta.'
'Forgive me, Friend Dhumketu.'
'I could not save your life.'
In the game of chess
the king is the most important.
But despite being so important
he proceeds only one
step forward in one move
when compared to the other coins.
Have you ever wondered why is it so?
Because all the other coins
work hard to protect the king.
In real life too
this is the relationship
between a king and his army.
That is why a king should
always choose such people in his army
who will be always ready to sacrifice
their lives for their
king's safety and respect
because if it is a
game of chess or real life
a great king is somebody
on whom the future
of the people depends.
My ethics..
Your destiny.
Finally, you have left
your sorrows and pain behind
and risen as a warrior.
March ahead with courage
to make your friend
Dhumketu, earn respect, Chandragupta!

================================================================================

Episode: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyqoJ4gGDGY

Hey! Who are you! Leave me!
Where are you taking me! Leave me!
Leave me..
What is all this!
Finally you have left your sorrows and
pain behind and risen as a warrior.
A warrior who has the passion
to give a befitting answer
to his enemy, Chandragupta!
Turn your sorrows into your asset
and not weakness, Chandragupta!
Start the battle for independence
from the point your friend,
Dhumketu, left it.
Dhumketu, who became a martyr!
But even after his death
he has not been given
the respect of a warrior.
He has been slandered with
the humiliation of being a traitor.
'Every citizen who
passes through here'
'will throw stones on him.'
'Hit him!'
Chandragupta,
it is your duty to give Dhumketu
the respect and honour
that he deserves.
It is important to perform the last
rites of a warrior like Dhumketu
with all the rituals.
His sacrifice should
be acknowledged by us.
So, scatter the darkness of sorrows
and march ahead with courage
to make your friend, Dhumketu,
earn respect, Chandragupta!
'Dhumketu died for his motherland.'
'In this battle, you have lost
a loved one for the first time.'
'But it is not the last
time that someone would die.'
'In this rebellion for united
India'many will attain martyrdom.'
'Now that you have witnessed
Dhumketu's sacrifice'
'keep its memory
alive in your heart.'
'You are the future king
of united India, Chandragupta.'
'You cannot lose yourself
in the sea of despair.'
'But by keeping the fire of courage
that Dhumketu displayed alive'
'you can indeed destroy the kingdom
of that cruel and evil Dhananand.'
Dhumketu happily sacrificed their
life with the belief Chandragupta
that you will fulfill
the dream of united India.
'You will become his future King.'
'So, do not cry over his sacrifice'
'but remember the lesson
that you learnt from it.'
'For the success of every rebellion'
'a battle has to be fought
and blood has to be shed.'
'So from now on,
remember, Chandragupta'
'that no matter what happens
or whatever the cost is'
'you cannot allow
yourself to be shattered.'
'Dhumketu!'
'When you set
Dhumketu's pyre on fire'
'keep that fire alive in your heart'
'until you give a meaning
to the sacrifice of Dhumketu'
'and many people like him'
'by becoming the future
king of united India.'
'The way Arjun had not
stopped fighting after the death'
'of his son, Abhimanyu'
'in the same way'
'you have to continue
with the rebellion.'
'This battle against Dhananand
is for righteousness'
'as well as for dignity.'
Your Highness, look there!
'Your destruction is around'
'the corner, Dhananand.'
'Be ready to be destroyed.'
"Chandragupta Maurya!"
Your end is near you, Dhananand.
I will exact revenge
for all the lives
that you have ended.
You will have to pay for
the death of all those lives.
I, Chandragupta Maurya, swear that!
I, the future king of united India
swear to destroy you!
"The sun of united India!"
"Chandragupta Maurya.."
"Chandragupta Maurya!"
"Chandragupta Maurya!"
Where are you going, Chandragupta?
I am going to Seleucus
so that he gets us the army
and weapons as soon as possible.
Acharya, there are only
ten days left to the full moon.
We do not have time and we
have to make a lot of preparations.
Moreover, without an army
no rebellion can be successful.
Indeed.
Of course, you should go to Seleucus
to gain an army and weapons.
Seleucus has the greatest
weapons and armaments.
He even has an army.
And the money that you have given
him will make him give you all this.
But do you think
that you will gain the
loyalty of Seleucus' army?
What do you mean?
Seleucus'soldiers will
definitely fight for you
but their loyalty will
lie with Seleucus and not you.
The motive for which
you have ignited
the flames of rebellion
foreign soldiers will
never be able to understand it.
You need an army that is loyal
to it's motherland
and its independence.
Chandragupta, you need such soldiers
who are loyal to the rebellion
and are not bound by a deal.
You need an army that will die
for the sake of this goal.
They should fight with all
they have for their motherland
the dream of united India and you.
But, Acharya,
where will we find such people?
Such loyalty and passion..
Who can have it other than us?
It is possible.
It is those people to whom
you are the heir, Chandragupta.
Kshatriyas of Piplivan.
Kshatriyas of Piplivan?
But Dhananand had killed them while
destroying Piplivan, right?
This is a lie! A great lie!
A lie that Dhananand
spread in the world.
He wanted the world
to think of it as the truth.
But Commander Matsaldev told me
that after the destruction of Piplivan
Dhananand had imprisoned
1000 soldiers from there.
They are those 1000 soldiers
who have the same courage
and a need for revenge
that you harbour.
If they are still
harbouring the same feelings
then each of them can take
on 100 soldiers of Dhananand.
Today, after 12 years
the soldiers who are
alive among those 1000..
If we join hands with them
then we will form such an army
that will destroy Dhananand,
Chandragupta.
Rest assured, Acharya.
The Kshatriya soldiers
of my Piplivan..
Wherever they are in Magadh
I will find them out.
Then our army
will stand against Dhananand.
So, you are all those guards
who have been chosen
by Amatya Rakshas.
So, now that you have become
the new protectors of the palace
I thought of welcoming
you with a joint banquet.
Amazing!
It smells delicious!
What happened?
What are you waiting for?
Start eating.
Come on! Enjoy your food!
These heads are of those guards
who failed to stop my enemies
from taking the corpse
of Dhumketu from the marketplace.
They neglected their duties.
If you make the same mistake
then I will be here with these plates
but they will bear your
heads instead of these heads.
Go! And let me enjoy my food!
Amatya Rakshas.
What is the status of
my gold from Hiranyagarbha?
The gold has been dispatched
towards the palace, Your Highness.
It will be here soon.
Deposit it safely
in my secured treasury.
Seleucus will soon come
to know that Chanakya has escaped.
In that case
he will try to lord it over me.
So, I will fortify Magadh..
Money..
I will fortify it with money.
Because I do not want Seleucus
to think that he is better than me.
- Of course, Your Highness.
- And yes!
Amatya Rakshas
keep your eyes peeled and ears open.
I think that soon something
is going to happen in the palace.
Rest assured, Your Highness.
This time,
there will not be any mistake.
Think about it, Mother.
There must be a place
where Dhananand could have
imprisoned the Kshatriyas of Piplivan.
I did not even know that
for 12 years Dhananand has kept
the Kshatriyas of
Piplivan imprisoned here.
But I know something.
If Dhananand has imprisoned them
he must be making them do some task
instead of keeping them in jail.
Because Dhananand knows
that each Kshatriya of Piplivan
is as strong as 100 people.
They can even live
in the harshest conditions.
Chandra, I.. I am going home.
I am feeling restless.
I am going.
What happened, Indra?
New coins were deposited
in the royal treasury.
And when I was counting them, I saw
that they were drenched in blood.
I wonder whom that blood belonged to.
I do not know the conditions
in which that money was brought
into the royal treasury
that all those coins were..
All those coins were
drenched in blood.
I am feeling anxious due to the same.
New coins?
But where did the coins come from?
It is not the time
for recovering the tax.
No. These coins were
not recovered as the tax.
If this money was not recovered
as tax from the people of Magadha
then where can so
much of gold come from?
Indra, think about it.
You must have heard about this gold.
Think about it and tell us.
Yes.
I had heard the soldiers saying
that this gold is not the
result of the hard work of labourers
but a result of the
gruesome conditions
of the king's old enemies, Chandra.
A result of the gruesome
conditions of his old enemies..
Were they talking about
the Kshatriyas of Piplivan?
After listening to my
mother and Indra, it seems
that the place from
where the gold was brought
is the place where Dhananand
has kept the soldiers of Piplivan
and is making them work.
But I have to confirm my doubt
and Indra will help me in the same.
I will follow the chariots
that brought the gold here
so that I can find the place
that is the origin of that gold.
- Maitri..
- It will be troublesome.
Does Acharya Chanakya know your plan?
No, he does not know.
Moreover,
I do not have time to inform him.
Acharya asked me to
find those Kshatriyas.
I am going to do the same.
Despite being the future king
Chandragupta does
not care for his life.
He is stubborn.
If he decides something
- he completes it.
- But I know Acharya Chanakya.
He would want to
know this information.
I should inform him
as soon as possible.
Come on.
Hurry up! Move forth! Come on.
Move.. Come on.
'I hope that this path'
'takes me to the
Kshatriyas of Piplivan.'
To turn into a sword
a piece of iron goes
through many processes.
It has to be beaten by a hammer.
It is sharpened using many methods.
It is heated using fire.
After going through
all these processes
a sword gains its identity.
Similarly,
the troubles faced by a person
sorrows and defeat
shape the personality of that person.
So, if you want to defeat
your enemy like a sword
then be ready to
face those experiences
that shape up a sword and sharpen it.
Then you will succeed.
My ethics..
Your destiny.
It affirms my doubt
that you are Chanakya's spy.
Where he is hiding my money
and about his student, along
with whom he is conspiring against me.

================================================================================

Episode: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UhBtFuK87MU

'It is afternoon'
'but we have not reached the place'
'from where Dhananand
is getting his gold.'
'What is the secret of that place?'
Amazing!
Brother, do you remember
that we used to play
this game when we were kids?
I remember it, Brother.
Every moment spent with
you is memorable to me.
Brother, I agree
that you have lost your finger.
But by helping in capturing Dhumketu
you have earned my respect again.
Thank you, Your Highness.
But I do not know why I feel
that something is still missing.
I do not know, but there is something
that we are unable to see.
Look there!
Look at that bird!
It is different
because it is a messenger.
Rest assured, Your Highness.
From the time your money was stolen
all the messenger birds near
the palace are being followed.
Well done!
Then we have to catch
the one who sent that bird.
So as a spy, Acharya Chanakya
uses even beautiful women like you.
You should be ashamed to talk
so cheaply about Acharya Chanakya.
A different tone!
It affirms my doubt
that you are Chanakya's spy.
The thing is,
all my moves are striking true today.
I guessed blindly
yet I came to know the truth.
Soon that thief Chanakya
will be in front of me again.
With his death his oath,
the creation of united India
and appoint another king
will be ended by me!
'We are far from the
palace and the city.'
'I wonder what this place holds.'
'The security is tight here.'
'I have to hide somewhere else.'
Why is this place guarded so well
despite being far from the palace?
Does this place hold
Dhananand's secret treasure
from where those coins
were sent to the palace?
It seems that this is the same place
where the Kshatriyas of Piplivan
are being treated as
labourers by Dhananand.
I have to go near and check.
Do you know what is
going to happen to you?
My soldiers will burn
you with smouldering coal
and make you spill
everything about Chanakya.
They will torture you so
much that you will spew everything.
You will tell us where
he is hiding my money
and about his student, along
with whom he is conspiring aginst me.
You will tell us everything
through your lovely lips.
The things that you want
me to say after being tortured
let me tell you the same now.
You are a cunning man!
You are an impotent king!
Soon, the future
king of India will rise
and trample you to become the king.
Hail India!
You found salvation, but still
Chanakya will not survive!
Soon, my soldiers
will reach the messenger
using which you used
to send messages to Chanakya!
Did you hear that!
Chanakya, wherever you are
I will soon find
out your plans and you.
So, this is the secret
of Dhananand's wealth.
A gold mine!
This is the messenger bird
that was used by Maitri
to send messages to Chanakya.
Before it could reach Chanakya
it was killed.
What about the message
that it was carrying?
Where is it?
Your Highness, we did not
find any message tied to it.
Vishnugupta Chanakya has
again defeated us, Your Highness.
No.. Amatya Rakshas.
He has not defeated us.
Yes, this is indeed a game
in which Chanakya
is ahead of me sometimes
or I am ahead of him sometimes.
In a few days
Chanakya has lost two
of his loyal soldiers.
So, this game
is not so bad for me yet.
Accept my homage Warrior Maitri.
I trust that when
you sacrificed yourself
you must not have thought
even for a moment.
United India will be indebted
to brave women like you.
But, Acharya
how do you already
know about Maitri's death?
Who sent you this information?
My faith in Maitri told me.
I always knew that the day
Maitri's identity
is revealed to Dhananand
dshe would choose only one option.
She would choose to sacrifice herself.
Acharya, before it reached you
how did you kill that messenger bird?
To stave off such emergencies
I had made this plan long ago.
'In case of an emergency'
'if you have to send me a message'
'Send it to the ruins of the
pillar about a mile away from here.'
'So, even if someone
is following your messenger'
'they would not be able
to reach our secret hermitage.'
'Rest assured,
Acharya I will do the same.'
I knew that Maitri would send
me a message related to Chandragupta.
So, I was waiting for the
messenger bird near that pillar.
But when I saw those
soldiers approaching
I realised
that I do not have any other option
than to kill that messenger bird.
First, Dhumketu..
And now, Maitri..
I wonder how many
sacrifices will be needed
to dethrone Dhananand, Acharya.
Many sacrifices will be made
in this battle for independence.
But these sacrifices will
make us strong and not weak.
They will fan the flames of rebellion.
Pray to God
that Chandragupta finds
the Kshatriyas of Piplivan soon
who have been captured
and hidden by Dhananand.
Once those Kshatriyas join
us in the battle for independence
then our power will increase.
Are these the Kshatriyas of Piplivan?
Someone, help him!
Stop!
So the Kshatriyas of Piplivan..
You will never stop doing acting.
So my doubt was correct.
These are the Kshatriyas of Piplivan
whom Dhananand had
made captive for 12 years.
Soldiers!
You have become wounded very badly.
You have had a severe head injury.
It seems your spinal
cord has broken too.
Now you are of no use to me.
'If you learn to control
your anger and nurse it'
'then it will become
your biggest help.'
No..
No, this time I will not be enraged.
I will form a plan and act upon it.
Do not worry, Kshatriyas of Piplivan.
I promise you
that I will return soon
and free you all
from the shackles
of torture and slavery.
I just need to find the right way.
I found a way.
Now, I will steal this golden rock
and make it my key
to enter this gold mine.
Acharya
soon our army
will stand against Dhananand.
Our enemy, Chanakya,
is always a step ahead of us.
The proof is in front of you.
Before, I could save
my treasure from him
he stole my secret treasure
and hid it successfully.
When I poisoned Chanakya
he successfully executed
his plan of escaping with Dhumketu.
And when
we followed the messenger
bird sent to him
he killed it before it reached him.
This proves
that if we have to
win against Chanakya
we have to make a plan that
is a step ahead of his consideration.
That will happen, Your Highness.
Your Highness, I have found something
that can put us a
step ahead of Chanakya.
It can help us in finding
the next plan of Chanakya.
I thought that you would be
wallowing in the sorrow
of your friend's death.
But you are standing here,
in front of me to help me.
A slave cannot wallow in sorrows,
Your Highness.
So, instead of wallowing
in the sorrow of Dhumketu's death
I went to his home.
Then..
I found this.
This is a rock from my gold
mine and no one knows about it.
Dhumketu had this
rock and it indicates
that Chanakya definitely
knows about your gold mine.
- What!
- And the presences of this rock says
that after your secret treasure
Chanakya is eyeing your gold mine.
Your Highness, there is someone
who has joined hands with Chanakya.
Do you suspect someone from that mine
who could be your enemy?
Everyone there is my enemy!
Because everyone there
is a Kshatriya from Piplivan.
Think about it, Your Highness.
If Chanakya can bring
this rock from there
it means that he can contact
the Kshatriyas of Piplivan.
He can instigate them against
you and make them fight you.
He can make them rebel.
Your Highness,
I think that you should send Amatya
and end this problem
before it can rise.
No, Your Highness.
If I go there, it will alert them.
First, we have to
find out their plans.
For that, we have to send
our most faithful person amongst them
as a slave.
That person will act as our spy.
So, do you have someone
who can do this job, Amatya Rakshas?
There is a person, Your Highness.
Who other than your dear slave,
Chandragupta can complete this task?
He is the only one
who has the capability
to do the impossible.
Amazing!
So, you will take Chandragupta
to the gold mine, Amatya.
All right, your Highness.
'I just need to enter
the gold mine now.'
'I am going there alone but'
'I will come out with
my entire Kshatriya army'
'to destroy you, Dhananand.'
What does a person need
the most to stay alive?
Food?
Water?
Or air to breathe?
No, the most important thing is hope.
Even if a person does
not have items of luxury
but if he carries the
hope for a bright future
he can turn that hope into his power
and can overcome all the obstacles
that may befall him in near future.
So, even if you lose
everything in your life
do not lose your hope.
Do remember a ray of hope
a ray of hope is enough to
ward off the darkness of despair.
My ethics..
Your destiny.
Chandragupta meets
every warrior in that mine
how are you so sure that
they would believe Chandragupta.
It will be more difficult to instill
hope in those warriors of Piplivan
than rescuing them from the mine.

================================================================================

Episode: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UakNNc59kwg

I hope you don't
mind remaining chained.
You see, Chandragupta..
The plan was to send you
into these mines as a prisoner.
Hence, you must seem like them.
Sure.
But what is the motive behind
restraining me so early before
executing the plan?
I sense a different motive, Amatya.
Perhaps your plan was not
to make me look like a prisoner
but to make me feel like a prisoner.
Come!
Now make haste.
Patan Raj!
Order me, Senior Amatya.
His Highness has
ordered that this slave
be put to work in this
mine like your other prisoners.
And make him do rigorous work.
Brilliant.
After a long time,
I will get to extract gold
using the strength of a youth.
Moreover,
I am fed up of these old workers.
Why are they being hurt, Patan Raj?
Did they try to flee from here?
Try to flee?
Even their souls cannot
escape this place, Senior Amatya.
They are no more useful to me.
They have become a burden.
Hence I am shedding this burden.
Kill them!
No.
Stop!
Isn't it your concern that
they are no more useful to you
and who would work in their stead?
I will work in their place.
Just spare their lives.
Will this boy alone
do the work of five men?
Let us see how long he keeps it up.
Put him to work at once!
I hope you have understood
that I did this to win
the trust of these workers.
- See you.
- Take him away!
Remember, Patan Raj.
This slave must not
leave from here alive.
I was told that he had
come here upon the king's orders
for a special purpose.
To catch some troublemaker.
He is the root of all trouble!
I want this trouble to
be buried in this mine forever.
You must make sure that his death
looks like an accident.
And if you are unsure of doing this..
Remember, Patan Raj..
You owe me who you are today.
The king bestowed you
with this title upon my behest!
The king will hear and
see what I disclose to him!
And if this slave
gets out of here alive
your death is certain.
Do not worry, Amatya.
Your job will be done.
Because he is in my lair now.
Good.
Now that this boy
will work in your stead
go and spend the rest of your useless
lives in some corner of the mine.
If you are fortunate enough
you will attain death soon.
Or else,
you will rot in this hell longer.
What did you think?
That you have done us
a favour by saving our lives?
No, you have not done us a favour.
Rather, you have added to
our misery by saving our lives.
Once upon a time, people would
be all praises about my strong arms.
But today,
they are hardly strong enough
to carry this staff.
You have added to my humiliation
and made me lose my self-respect.
I will never bless you.
Never, ever.
Never..
Kushdhwaj?
'Kushdhwaj was the best
spear man of Piplivan.'
'His aim was flawless
With his strong arms'
'he would kill enemies
from far distances away.'
'Piplivan had won many battles
because of his might and skill.'
'He had immense strength and focus.'
Come, it is time to brand you.
Take this slave away.
Henceforth,
you are a slave of this hell
and like every other slave
you would bear a brand of slavery
so that it reminds you
that you will never escape.
Thank you very much.
Now even I am one of them.
- I can reduce their burden.
- Too arrogant, are you?
But just as gold melts
in the heat of this mine
so will your body and your arrogance.
Baldev!
Take him away
and tell him that it
is futile to act strong here.
Here he must toil day in and day
out and extract gold for His Majesty
and if he makes any mistakes
even you must face the consequence.
Sure, master.
Take him away!
Act tough all you want, slave.
But tonight will be
the last night of your life.
Until Chandragupta frees the warriors
of Piplivan from the gold mine
we must plot further strategies.
We must find out
who is appointed to
handle security details
in Dhananand's palace and when.
The number of soldiers
posted at each gate..
Where in the palace
can we sneak inside..
We must find this out
to infiltrate the palace
and for this, first of all we must draw a rough map of Dhananand's palace.
After that
our plan to infiltrate
the palace will become easy.
Come.
But Acharya, even if Chandragupta
meetsevery warrior in that mine
how are you so sure that
they would believe Chandragupta
and join Chandra's
army for our revolution.
This will indeed be difficult.
It will be more difficult
to instill hope in
those warriors of Piplivan
than rescuing them from the mine.
All these years of slavery
must have destroyed their morale.
The chains of servitude
must have killed their bravery.
Chandragupta's biggest challenge
is to instill courage in them again.
Is that all the strength you have?
You can barely lift a simple hammer.
And you think you could
do the work of five strong men.
Come with me.
Let me introduce you to this hell
so that all your delusions are broken.
Come.
'There are around 500 former
warriors here and just 50 guards.'
'Yet they are not even
making an attempt to escape.'
'Years of slavery has destroyed
their warrior within.'
'There is only one way to free them.'
'I must make them realise
their courage and valour.'
'I must remind them of who they were.'
'Fearless,
brave warriors of Piplivan.'
What happened?
Are you looking for a way to escape?
You can try all your life
but this mine will
forever keep yielding gold
and we will keep toiling here forever.
Hence, the sooner
you give up this thought
the better it would be for you.
Because escaping this place
is impossible for even me.
'I have never seen Baldev
utter the word 'impossible'.'
'Because he always had the
grit to achieve the impossible.'
'He was a strong-man
and ace warrior of Baldev.'
'He was the pride of our army.'
'And his specialty was'
'he beat his opponents
not just with might'
'but also his will-power.'
'Giving up was never in his nature.'
'This very confidence
and optimism of his'
'made him an invaluable
asset for Piplivan.'
'The warrior who would never give up'
'and would defeat enemies
with confidence and optimism'
'has given up all hope today.'
You ruined my one
last hope for salvation.
- Look..
- Enough.
You have caused enough damage.
Do not say a word more.
Because a slave like you cannot
understand the feelings of a warrior.
Never!
And I am such an unfortunate warrior
who has to just await his death
despite knowing that he won't
attain martyrdom on the battlefield.
Do not say a word more.
Ever since your gold
mine has garnered profits
we have doubled the production
of weapons, Your Majesty.
Why just double, Senior Amatya?
Increase it fourfold!
I want us to be ahead of
Seleucus even regarding armoury.
Put our best weapon forgers to work.
I want two chests of goods
from our mine, Senior Amatya.
So be it, Your Majesty.
If that Chanakya is instigating
those former warriors against me
we must ensure
that we burden them with so much work
that all that is left of their hope
and courage gets crushed to rubble
and they cannot even
think of rebellion.
I will kill them by over-working them!
So that not just Chanakya
I can gain control
over all the 15 tribes.
Sure, Your Majesty.
Your wish is my command.
- What amazing swords!
- Yes, Your Majesty.
This can kill five enemies
in a single blow, Your Majesty.
I have got this forged for myself,
Your Majesty.
After growing skilled in combat
I wish to see you feel
proud of me on the battlefield.
However, Senior Minister..
The efficacy of a weapon
lies in the hand that wield it.
I think this weapon
is fit for someone else.
Who, Your Majesty?
My dearest Chandragupta!
He has done lots for me,
Senior Amatya.
He deserves this, at least.
I guess even you agree with this.
- Am I right?
- Yes, Your Majesty.
It is owing to his faith in himself
that you sent him
on such a crucial mission
to my gold mine.
Am I right, Senior Amatya?
Indeed, Your Majesty.
Slave Chandragupta
is indeed incomparable.
'But pardon me, Your Majesty.'
'You will soon hear
about Chandragupta's death.'
A death falcon!
What is a death falcon?
It is a symbol of death.
Whenever this bird cries here
someone surely dies in here.
So, one more will die today.
Come, everyone.
Let us see who the
lucky one among you is!
You should have let them
die at Patan Raj's hands.
Or else,a warrior clansman would not
be compelled to end their own life.
I know that you would
call this cowardice.
But I am not burning myself
by jumping into this furnace
but also all my humiliation,
torture and shame
heaped upon me for 12 years
which made me forget
my courage and my real form.
Hence, in these final
moments of my life
I wish to remember not the Almighty
but the memories of Piplivan
and the sacrifice of
my great king Chandravardhan
and his bravery and valour.
Please do not jump!
You must not give up hope!
Hope? Lad, I had lost all hope
when I was brought
to this hell as a prisoner.
King Chandravardhan, please forgive me
for choosing such
a path for my liberation.
But I have no hope left
for escaping from here.
'Enough! Not anymore!'
'I, the prince of Piplivan,
will appear before them'
as the ray of hope to destroy
the darkness in their lives.'
I know that our prince
the last heir of Maurya
clan was killed on the very day
when that wicked
Dhananand killed our king
No!
Coal and seed may be
different in appearance.
But there is a
similarity between them.
Both of them, when deep below
in pitch darkness and
under immense pressure
become invaluable.
Coal turns into diamond
and a seed transforms
into a vast tree.
It is the same even with humans.
If a human stands firmly
in the face of huge odds
and strives to find
a way even in pitch darkness
and overcomes pressure and stress
only then he becomes great.
My ethics..
Your destiny.
No fear of death! No love for life!
Victory or death!
For the warriors of Piplivan!
I will free you all from here!

================================================================================

Episode: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwllI3rVbZg

I know..
That the our prince,
the last of the Maurya line was killed
the day when Dhananand
killed our King!
No!
'Give me your word, Chandragupta!'
'No matter how dire
the situations are!'
'You will not unveil'
'your true identity to
the warriors of Piplivan.'
'I will be the one to decide
as to how we will tell them'
'of you who you are and till
then you shall act as a mere slave.'
'Give me your word.'
'I give you my word, Acharya.'
Stop wasting time with futile words!
Jump at once.
Neither your dead King
Chandravardhan will come to save
nor any prince of Piplivan!
Laugh all you want!
Remember this well, Patan Raj!
A storm will come from the
land of Piplivan that will engulf you
and your evil Dhananand!
Await your death!
Hail the land of Piplivan!
Hail King Chandravardhan!
No!
'I hope that Chandra
is safe and sound.'
Stulbhadra.
How do you plan to enter the palace?
Acharya, we can infiltrate
the palace in here
if we dig a tunnel from
right here and we can attack them.
Here? A tunnel in this direction?
- Have you thought well?
- Yes.
A river flows this side of the palace.
How can you dig a
tunnel through the river?
Where are you lost in thoughts?
Yes, Acharya.
I was lost thinking
about something else.
I am worried for Chandragupta.
He is over there in great danger
and the very thought of him
being in peril strikes fear within me.
Whenever you are
worried for Chandragupta
you must remember
the hurdles and perils
and all the threats
that Chandragupta over came
with a new confidence
energy and valour!
Every hindrance he faces, only makes
him stronger and even more competent.
Chandragupta is true gold
and when he comes out
of the gold mine and the labours
then he will be at his finest.
No matter how terrible
situations lay forth
and even the greatest
of perils lay before him..
He must free himself
and the warriors of Piplivan
from all that danger!
Chandragupta has only two options
in this great righteous war!
He will either be victorious
or a martyr.
Seeing the slave getting
riled by the death of that man
I now believe that the
councillor may be right.
This slave is reason
for all the troubles!
We must kill him as soon as we can.
It will be done.
But remember this well..
The emperor is fond of this slave.
His death must look like an accident.
We have never failed you, my Lord.
It will be done as you wish.
Please rest assured.
Agreed.
I have sent other
guards to the perimeter
and I will make certain
that none of them comes here
So that your path stays clear
and that slave dies tonight!
'Hail King Chandravardhan!'
'No.'
'My soldiers die hailing
the name of my father!'
'But no more! I will give
them a new life! A new hope!'
'I will set them free!'
Slave.
Slave.
It seems you have never
seen a death up close before
and that is why you seem so rattled.
Rest assured.
Give it time.
You will soon be used to this torment.
Are you used to this?
Even after 12 years
I can still see the same pain
in your eyes even now.
You are right.
I am in pain
but I do not mourn the
death of my fellow warrior.
I am hurt as this is
not the death he wanted.
None of us want to die like this!
We all want to die fighting
and defending our motherland
in the battlefield like a warrior!
We have been taught this
one thing since childhood!
No fear of death! No love for life!
Victory or death!
For the warriors of Piplivan!
For the warriors of Piplivan!
No fear of death! No love for life!
Victory or death!
For the warriors of Piplivan!
No fear of death! No love for life!
Victory or death!
For the warriors of Piplivan!
Warriors of Piplivan!
These are not mere words
but the flame
that can rekindle
the power within you!
The gold burning in these forges
have not yet allowed
your blood to run cold.
So remember it well.
This torment and this humiliation!
This pain and suffering!
Use it as a fuel
to fan the flames of your revenge!
Repeat after me!
No fear of death! No love for life!
Victory or death!
For the warriors of Piplivan!
For the warriors of Piplivan!
I will free you all from here!
I will bring you hope!
I give you my word!
Hope is the worst thing
for ones rotting in these mines!
If they see hope,
they will begin to imagine.
That it is possible
for this pain to end!
And they may believe
in a great future!
A future that never exists!
We have been dying
here for past 12 years!
And we know the truth!
We know it well
that we will never leave from here!
The sooner you accept this fate
the better it will be for you.
Always remember this, kid.
Never make a promise
that you cannot keep.
'Agnimukh was the greatest
swordsman of Piplivan.'
'His blade was fierce as fire'
'and his strike was
faster than lightning!'
'His strike was as deadly'
'and mighty as his rage.'
It seems that people
here do not like you much.
So let me send you to a place
where you can work in solace.
To the deep end of the mine.
It will be dark in there.
- How will I be able to work?
- Agnimukh!
Bring him light.
He will be able to live and
only then he can bring the gold out.
Now move, kid!
My Lord, he is a kid.
Leave him be.
This ominous bird is screeching again.
It seems as if this kid will
be the next to die after Kushdhwaj.
'Patan Raj has an ill ploy
as he sends me in the mine.'
'I must stay on guard.'
Search for him.
He must be hiding in here.
The ominous bird predicted his death.
I regret to say
that the dear slave of the
Emperor has died in an accident.
"Chandragupta! Chandragupta!"
The Councillor was right.
You are the reason
for all the troubles.
I did not kill them on purpose.
They tried to kill me for no reason
so I had to defend myself.
I will punish you
for what you have done.
I did not wish to kill them
and nor do I wish to strike you.
I will not hear a thing!
You are a rebel and
you will be punished.
I will rest easy after I kill you!
Bring Patan Raj out at once!
What have you done, kid?
He mocked the death of Kushdhwaj
so Patan Raj met this fate!
You done a crime!
Do you know what that entails?
The guards stationed outside
will come in any moment.
What happens then?
Have you thought of that?
Even they will die
just as
Patan Raj did!
But I feel disgusted seeing your fall!
Search deep within yourself!
And try, if you must
to see this form of yours!
And you will get
an answer from within!
That it will be better
to die as free folk
than to live as slaves!
Today, I, a mere kid
killed four soldiers
right in front of you!
So all of you warriors
cannot fight the fifty guards
and be free?
In the age of youth,
blood carries rage
but for the past 12 years
we have suffered torment
and we have been humiliated!
And if by killing those four you think
that you can escape
this hell of Dhananand
then you are gravely mistaken!
I am determined and not mistaken!
I am confident.
That we will be freed tonight!
Even if I have to face
all those guards all alone by myself!
Emperor Dhananand
comes here with his army!
Patan Raj!
What is happening here, slave?
Bahuka!
My lord.
It appears that a
revolt was brewing here.
It seems that this slave
has killed the guards.
I think that he was
not aware of your arrival
and he thought he can escape
after killing the guards!
This shell.
It was once a shell
of a sea dwelling creature
and in time that being
abandoned this shell
as the being grew in form.
Such is the life of a person.
The situations which
keep us safe at beginning
must be abandoned
when the time arrives.
In order to progress further
one must cross the
bridges and move ahead.
If you wish to grow as a person
then you must come out
of your place of comfort
and face hardships and challenges.
Only then will you
walk the path of progress.
My ethics..
Your destiny.
I had lace the food with
poison of the rebellious Kshatriya.
This feast will end all
the troubles in their lives.

Your Majesty, this indicates
the start of a rebellion.
It seems that this slave
has killed the guards.
I think that he was
not aware of your arrival
and he thought he can escape
after killing the guards!
No, Your Highness, not revolt
but theft was taking place here.
No one else but your faithful
bodyguard did the stealing.
That was Patan Raj that
joined hands with your enemies.
He came here with his friends
and tried to steal your gold.
When he realized that I have come to
know about his plan he got confused.
He then sent all
bodyguards away from here.
He planned to kill me.
Whatever I did, Your Highness
was for self-defence.
If you do not believe me
then you can ask other bodyguards.
That who removed them from here.
Is this servant speaking the truth?
I am sorry, Your Highness.
We have no idea about
the theft of gold of Patan Raj.
But this is true that Patan Raj
asked us to go from here.
Dhananand!
Only Patan Raj has
challenged you today
but soon not just one man
but the entire Magadh
will stand against you.
And one day, let alone a kingdom
the entire country
will stand against you.
You must only wait
for your death now, Dhananand.
How dare you speak
to His Majesty that way!
'After years, I am seeing
the rage in the eyes of my enemies'
'which I doused long ago.'
'Right now,
fanning the ember is pointless.'
Agnimukh!
Agnimukh.. Agnimukh!
Just because your name
means 'fire-breather'
does not imply you
are always hot-tempered.
Since 12 years we
have had great relations.
You provide gold to me from this cave
and in exchange,
I refrain from bothering you.
This man.. He is new here
and does not know about
our peaceful treaty.
Am I right?
They are all our own. Weapons down.
Bahuka!
You must handle Patan Kingdom hereon.
You must take the place
of the Chief of Security.
Chandragupta, you must come with me.
I need to discuss
whatever happened here.
'I wonder what this
evil king is planning now.'
'No matter what it is,
I am certain it is not good news'
'for the people of Piplivan and I.'
'The Patan Raj has
certainly killed the slave.'
'Hence His Majesty looks troubled.'
I regret what happened.
- How do you know about it?
- I am Amatya.
Such news does not
stay hidden for long.
It surfaces with time.
So you knew that it was Patan Raj
who would steal my gold
and give it to Chanakya?
What I do regret
is not killing him by my own hands.
Greetings, Amatya.
Your arrival did not go in vain.
Pardon me, Your Majesty.
I had no idea that it was Patan Raj.
What I do know
is that it was someone loyal.
It is good
that the trouble has passed.
I do not understand
what is so good about it.
I can see such
a rebellious rage in them
which, if not doused can cause havoc.
And Chanakya must have
instigated the Kshatriya
after making contact with them.
I feel the same way, Your Majesty.
But do not worry.
I will befriend the Kshatriya
and get more information from them.
No!
No, slave.
Did you not see?
Agnimukh was enraged
and sought vengeance.
It is clear from his intentions
that he has been shown hope of freedom
else in the past 12 years, I have
never seen Agnimukh behave this way.
I am certain,
Chanakya promised him freedom.
Your Majesty, we must stop
this rebellion at any cost!
Yes, Amatya. We must do what
we need to stop this rebellion.
We will kill the rebel.
Summon the army
and kill each one of the Kshatriya.
Certainly, Your Majesty.
Pardon me, Your Majesty.
This might be the biggest
mistake we ever make.
I mean
if you have them killed
the news will reach Seleucus
and he might begin to think
that you are losing
control over your people.
And if Kshatriya who
live the lives of slaves
are killed they will
be considered martyrs.
Your Majesty
I did not want to say this
but for the first time in life
I agree with this slave.
Fine!
We will not kill them but, Amatya
I want eyes on all of them.
Chanakya must not succeed.
It will be done, Your Majesty.
Everyone, attention!
This is the historic day
when our King Dhananand
destroyed Piplivan.
And he brought Kshatriya
from the battlegrounds
to this cave for survival.
So on this golden and historical day
to be etched in your memories
His Majesty has organised
a grand feast. Move forward!
Lord Bahuka, what is happening?
I thought,
His Majesty would be angry at them.
You need not interfere.
Stay quiet and get to work.
All right, I understand.
I will serve some water to everyone,
is that okay?
Well, this can be considered
the final supper, Amatya.
Because the food has
been laced with poison.
Do not fear, Amatya.
I did not lace your food with poison
but that of the rebellious Kshatriya.
They wanted freedom.
This feast will end
all the troubles in their lives.
Keep drinking water or
you might choke on the food.
Here, have some water.
Keep consuming water.
This means,
they have been given poisoned food?
Yes!
The most poisonous extract.
A few drops
will douse the rage
of the rebellion in them.
Was I not told that
I should not seek the help
of my army to fight them!
I thought this idea
was a good one so I decided
to stealthily
and secretly
poison them to death.
People will consider this
an accident.
- Wonderful!
- A few moments later
Chanakya's dreams will
come to an end with these people.
And the Kshatriya
will die like insects!
What is happening?
Did you think that after the way
Agnimukh spoke to His Majesty
he would spare them alive?
You are naive, slave.
His Majesty laced
their food with poison.
The poison is so strong
that in a few moments
after consuming it people die!
What are you waiting for?
Do you not remember
what His Majesty commanded?
Dispose their bodies in the jungle
so that when vultures
feast on their corpses
His Majesty can finally smile.
Your Majesty,
all the Kshatriya have been killed.
They have been poisoned.
Why did you do that?
A slave is allowed to only say 'yes'
not question the king!
Control your emotions.
I did not do anything.
Perhaps, due to something in the food
the Kshatriya lost their lives.
This is no conspiracy.
This is an accident.
There will be no rebellion now!
Nobody will challenge me
and nobody will be enraged.
'There will be a rebellion'
'and you will lose it all, Dhananand.'
'I swore while cremating Dhumketu'
'that I would build
an army of Kshatriya'
'and that army will soon
stand against you, Dhananand.
Wonderful! This is miraculous.
Am I hallucinating
or is this the reality?
They are not just alive
but they are strong
enough to fight the men
who left them here.
They defeated them, Acharya.
This is not hallucination.
This was what Chandragupta
and I planned.
'If Dhananand suspects
that the Kshatriya of Piplivan'
'are being rebellious'
'he will not spare them alive.'
'He will surely try to kill them.'
'Yes.'
'And I will ensure that
I convince Dhananand'
'to not use his army
to fight the Kshatriya.'
'But are you certain'
'Dhananand would try to poison them?'
'If he comes up with
another strategy to kill them'
'how will we save the Kshatriya,
Acharya?'
'I can understand your concern,
Chandragupta.'
'Dhananand has no other option but
to kill the Kshatriya with poison.'
'The reason being that killing'
'500 people at once
without them knowing'
'and making it look like
an accident to Seleucus'
'is only possible if Dhananand kills'
'all of them at once'
'and that can only be done
with a mass murder by poison.'
'And when that happens'
'this will help you.'
'This medicine can make
any poison become ineffective.'
'You must mix this
in the waters of the cave.'
'And you must ensure that each man'
'consumes as much of
it as possible before eating.'
I am proud of you, Chandragupta.
You have executed this plan well.
Wonderful! Splendid!
Such a great plan
by you and Chandragupta.
Come on, brave Kshatriya men!
Let us bring them all down!
Yes. Nobody can stop
us from forming an army
to fight Dhananand.
I hope that the second
phase of our strategy
- has been implemented.
- It has, Your Majesty.
Your Majesty, the second phase?
- What is that?
- I agree you are close to me
but you are yet a slave.
You are not that special that
I would tell you about my secrets.
That is the best
thing about your King.
Nobody is special for me.
Besides secret missions
can be carried out successfully
if they are kept a secret from
everyone till the moment of completion.
But since my plan
has been executed well
I can tell you about
my secret mission.
In order to bait Chanakya,
I have laid a trap with Kshatriya.
Just as Chanakya had
come to the traitor Dhumketu
he will surely come
to take these corpses too
and when he does, my army
will be waiting for him.
Today, Chanakya will be caught!
'Oh, Lord!
Dhananand has tricked everyone again.'
'Acharya and the army
of Kshatriya will be caught!'
Have you ever thought
why, since inception
fishes have been
trapped in these nets?
The reason is the simplicity
and natural form of this net.
If the enemy is attacked
fiercely and strongly
he will be warned
and will remain cautious
or he might become invasive
but if
he is trapped in a simple manner
he will surely be trapped.
You must be patient.
Then you must assure him
that he is in a safe environment.
That there could not
be a safer place than this.
When the enemy believes it
he will be off-guard
and he will be trapped the way
fishes are caught in this net.
Keep in mind
that the combination
of planning and patience
can help you attain victory.
My ethics..
Your destiny.
Acharya Chanakya,
this is conspiracy of Dhananand.
We have been surrounded
from all sides.

================================================================================

Episode: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zmc6K2GBywc

'According to Dhananand's plan,
Magadh's army'
will encircle Acharya Chanakya and
my Kshatriya friends and attack them.'
'The Kshatriyas of
Piplivan will not be ready'
'for such a battle
after so many years.'
'I will have to do something.'
'Otherwise, everyone will be killed.'
The path is clear.
We should go to a safe place soon.
What noise is this, Acharya?
This is definitely
a trap set by Dhananand.
Your Majesty, according to me
even I should go with your army
and help them in catching Chanakya.
Greetings.
Stop, Servant.
You worry unnecessarily.
My army is sufficient
to catch Chanakya.
Besides
you have done a lot for me.
I would like to honour you
for your selfless service and loyalty.
That is why I have
brought this gift for you.
I came to the mine from
Magadh to give you this gift.
A gift for me?
Your Majesty,
I am grateful for your mercy.
Remove the cloth.
'This wicked king
is gifting me weapons'
'and my army is standing weaponless'
'in front of the
same Dhananand's army.'
'I hope the Kshatriyas of Piplivan
face this situation bravely.'
Encircle all of them.
'King Dhananand had planned this
encircling strategy to catch Chanakya.'
'But where is Chanakya?'
Acharya, why are we standing here?
Come, let us go and help them.
No, Stulbhadra.
If we do this
Dhananand's plan will be successful.
This is what he wants.
That I go to help the Kshatriyas
or encourage them and get caught.
But he would have never
imagined even in his dreams
that the Kshatriyas of Piplivan
whom he had considered
dead all these years
will come to life again today.
But, Acharya,
the Kshatriyas of Piplivan
are not in a condition
to protect themselves.
Due to several years of torture
they would have lost their
courage and self-confidence.
A person's real strength
is not in his body
but in his thinking.
Today, it is time for the Kshatriyas
to awaken the same thinking.
Just how an ordinary man
does not forget to breathe
a Kshatriya never
forgets his weapon skills
or how to pick up a weapon
in front of his enemies.
We will not let them take
away our freedom from us again.
We will fight against them.
We will fight against them.
Come on!
Jayvant.
Check the circle
and attack from the top.
Fight bravely against the enemies.
Come on!
Prashant.
Take some people and spread
everywhere and form a circle.
Guard the east and west directions.
Come.
Baldev, guard the army from behind.
I will attack them from front.
Warriors of Piplivan
we were tolerating the torture
of Dhananand from 12 years.
But today..
Today, it is time
to get freedom from him.
We do not have weapons.
But we will fight.
We will fight using our brains.
Nobody will stay at the same
place for more than few seconds.
We will keep changing our places.
Today, we are the weapons
and we are everything.
Do you remember this,
warriors of Piplivan?
We are not scared of life or death.
Victory is precious!
This is the principle of Piplivan!
Victory is precious!
This is the principle of Piplivan!
This is a great strategy, Acharya.
The Kshatriyas are actually ready
to fight against Dhananand's army.
This is just the beginning.
Just wait and watch
how the fire of revenge
burning in the hearts
of the Kshatriyas
will destroy the army of Dhananand.
The people standing
in front of them today
is not Dhananand's army
but this is a golden opportunity
which will give them
freedom from years of slavery.
They have got a chance to fight for
a Kshatriya in the battlefield today.
This will awaken their bravery now.
Due to Chandragupta
they have succeeded
in stepping out from the goldmine
and freeing themselves
from the physical chains.
Now, they will get freedom
from their mental slavery
by fighting against Dhananand's army.
This will be their actual freedom.
I will have to inform
the king about this soon.
Amazing, Your Majesty.
This weapon is really amazing.
And it will be a matter of pride
for me to get this
weapon from your hands.
Now, I can use it to help your army.
Wrong!
Servant,
you have used the wrong words.
First, look how
destructive this weapon is.
Look how it will kill my enemies.
Your Majesty
this amazing weapon
has the capability
of killing many people at once.
My enemies will shiver with fear
if I use it against them.
Your Majesty.
What happened?
The Kshatriyas are not dead.
They are still alive.
What! But how is this possible?
- That.. - I had seen them
dying in front of my eyes.
T-That was an illusion, Your Majesty.
They are defeating our army,
Your Majesty.
If we do not send
more soldiers in time
the Kshatriyas will
defeat our army soon
and run away.
Amatya, gather our army.
The Kshatriyas cannot
free themselves and run away.
Okay, Your Majesty.
Get ready for the war.
Your Majesty.
Our army is ready.
'If the king reaches
there with more soldiers'
'my Kshatriya family will be killed.'
'I will have to stop Dhananand
from reaching there soon.'
'The Kshatriyas are
showing their bravery.'
If I succeed in stopping
Dhananand for sometime
my people from Piplivan
can defeat the remaining
soldiers of Dhananand's army.
And they will go away
from Dhananand's reach.
I will have to do something.
But what do I do?
Your Majesty, the Kshatriyas
turned out to be very smart.
I came here before you in
order to examine the situation.
But I saw that some Kshatriyas came
and blocked the only path that
leads to the forest and ran away.
But it is not late even now,
Your Majesty.
We can catch them even now.
What are you waiting for?
Help my servant.
'Agnimukh,
I hope you and your friends'
'can take advantage of this situation
and time and run away from here.'
Hurry up.
'I hope all the
Kshatriyas leave safely'
'before Dhananand reaches there.'
Your Majesty,
Chanakya took everyone with him.
Chanakya!
'Chanakya! Chanakya!'
Brahmin.
No matter who you are
we trusted you only because
you had the royal seal of Piplivan.
Now, we have reached a
safe place due to your guidance.
But you have not told us yet
about the reason
behind bringing us here.
I was quiet so far
because the information
that I want to give you
will have a greater impact
if you hear it from a dear one.
Whom are you referring to?
'Commander Matsaldev, this
warrior has sacrificed his weapon.'
'You should shout at Chandragupta.'
'I am sorry, Your Majesty.
I am grateful to you.'
'You and the queen have
always considered me your family.'
'But I will not be able
to shout at the prince.'
Commander Matsaldev?
We are not scared of life or death.
Victory is precious!
This is the principle of Piplivan!
Victory is precious!
This is the principle of Piplivan!
Victory is precious!
This is the principle of Piplivan!
Commander Matsaldev?
Commander Matsaldev, you are alive.
Yes, I am alive
because Dhananand could
take only my legs from me
and not my pledge
to fight against him.
All of us were alive.
But I have got my life back today
just like all of you.
Now, we will have to reestablish
Piplivan's lost pride and respect.
We will have to reawaken the lost
pride of the motherland of Piplivan.
Our revolution will begin now
when we will take our revenge
for our king and our kingdom
from that wicked Dhananand.
Why are all of you quiet?
May your pride remain forever,
Matsaldev.
But I do not agree
with this point of yours.
Yes, it is true that
we defeated an army today.
But that was a small army, Matsaldev.
We need a strong leadership
and a valid reason
to defeat Dhananand and Magadh.
And if we had to fight a war
against Dhananand for revenge
I had many chances in these 12 years.
But I did not oppose
because this is the truth.
We do not have a target
or a reason to fight this war.
There is a reason.
The sun has not set
on the Maurya Dynasty yet.
The prince of Piplivan
King Chandravardhan
and Queen Mura's son
Prince Chandragupta Maurya is alive.
"Chandragupta.."
The motive of a lamp is
to guide us through its light.
But
for the completion of it's motive
it is not sufficient
for the lamp to contain oil
because if the wick gets soaked
the lamp will not light.
If the speed of the air increases
it will burn and go off.
And if you try to use the lamp under the sunlight
it is meaningless.
This is how our decisions are.
For our decisions to succeed
it does not require
only a strong determination
but it also needs to be taken
at the right time,
place and circumstances.
That is when it will guide you.
Otherwise, it is meaningless.
My ethics..
Your destiny.
The warriors of
Piplivan have forgotten
that their Queen
serves me as a maiden.
Mura will pay for this act of theirs!

================================================================================

Episode: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKEtL2KtkSs

We have no purpose
and no calling for war.
We do have a reason!
The Maurya line has not ended!
The Prince of Piplivan..
The son of King Chandravardhan
and Queen Mura..
Prince Chandragupta Maurya is alive!
What? The Prince is alive?
Yes! Twelve years ago
I took the Prince away
and made sure that he lives on.
I am a witness of his
might and his courage.
I have seen his valour and kindness.
I have seen the same power in his eyes
as I had seen once
in the eyes of our King!
He carries the same compassion
as we have seen in Queen Mura.
He will lead us in this rebellion
against that evil Dhananand!
We believe you, Commander Matsaldev.
You have always been
true to your word!
If you say that the
Prince is still alive
then it must be true.
But in this revolt against Dhananand
we can only follow the
one that stands in front of us.
Where is our Prince?
He will come.
He will come from the waves!
He will turn the winds as he arrives.
"Chandragupta Maurya!"
One that will erase darkness
in Magadh and Bharat
and shine like the unblemished moon.
And he will be the Emperor
of the great land of Bharat!
"Chandragupta Maurya!
Chandragupta Maurya!"
'Warriors of Piplivan!
I will free you from here!'
'I will give you hope.'
'I give you my word!'
The slave?
You must be wondering
that one who lived
as a slave by your side
in those mines of gold..
Today stands here in front of you
as your Prince.
But it is the truth.
I am the son of
Emperor Chandravardhan Maurya
and the child of Queen Mura!
Chandragupta Maurya!
'Chandragupta Maurya!'
"Chandragupta Maurya!"
So what if I am a Prince?
So what if you are just warriors?
We have so much in common.
My freedom was taken
from me twelve years ago.
And the same happened to you all.
"Chandragupta Maurya!"
For twelve years you
suffered in those mines
toiling hard with your blood
sweat and tears.
For twelve years
my life passed in chains.
My pride was hurt!
And the one who caused
us this great pain
is that evil tyrant Dhananand!
Even a single beam of light
can shatter a void of dark.
And we all are so fortunate
that he freed us from slavery!
It is him! Acharya Chanakya!
One who ended the
chapter of my slavery
and thus began a new chapter
that will only end
when our fragmented state
comes together as the great Bharat!
It matters not what
you have lost or gained.
It depends on you what you leave
for your future generations to come!
Will they live a life of
slaves or breathe the free air!
It depends on what you decide!
So rise and fight for yourselves!
For your people!
If you lose and die,
you will die like a warrior.
And if you win then
we will serve no one!
Neither the tyrant
Dhananand will rule us
nor that invader Seleucus!
Now, I have the
courage to lead you all
as I have heard tales of your valour.
From your Queen Mura!
Baldevraj! Remember!
Every warrior that
you defeated in duel!
Agnimukh!
Remember the power of your blade!
For long you have slumbered as slaves!
Now after a span of twelve years
do not let your rage run cold!
We are free now!
And we will fight for Piplivan!
For every child of Bharat!
For our motherland!
For the great land of Bharat!
Dhananand's throne will burn to cinder
in the raging crimson
flames of a rebellion!
We will create history!
'We will create history!'
My father..
My other Kshatriya brothers..
Veerbhadra..
My friend Dhumketu..
And Maitri..
Everyone sacrificed their lives
for the freedom of their motherland.
And even if I have
to die to this battle
then here I come!
'Then here I come!'
And now I ask of you!
Will you follow your Prince to battle?
If yes, then roar with me!
No fear of death, no love for life!
Victory or death!
For the warriors of Piplivan!
Victory or death!
For the warriors of Piplivan!
For Piplivan!
- Hail Piplivan!
- Hail!
- Hail the line of Maurya!
- Hail!
- Hail Prince Chandragupta Maurya!
- Hail!
- Hail the line of Maurya!
- Hail!
- Hail Prince Chandragupta Maurya!
- Hail!
"Chandragupta Maurya!"
'You have mocked my locks.'
'I swear on it'
'that I will end your line,
Dhananand!'
'I will cast you
down from this throne'
'and I will place capable ruler here.'
Dhananand, the dark night
begins now.
The warriors of
Piplivan have forgotten
that their Queen
serves me as a maiden.
Mura will pay for this act of theirs!
My Lord.
Mura may have stood up
against you often
but for past twelve years
you have oppressed her.
It is impossible for
her to leave the palace.
That is what troubles me!
Everything that seemed impossible
has been unfolding now!
The armour and sword of the
King of Piplivan, Chandravardhan
is now missing from here!
So it means
that Chanakya has not just
freed the warriors of Piplivan
but he has also freed Mura!
So that they can muster their courage
seeing their Queen amongst them.
Mura!
- Hail Queen Mura!
- Hail!
- Hail Queen Mura!
- Hail!
- Hail Queen Mura!
- Hail!
- Hail Queen Mura!
- Hail!
- Hail Queen Mura!
- Hail!
- Hail Queen Mura!
- Hail!
- Hail Queen Mura!
- Hail!
- Hail Queen Mura!
- Hail!
- Hail Queen Mura!
- Hail!
- Hail Queen Mura!
- Hail!
This day will be etched in our memory!
Today, in our lives, Chandra will be
a beacon for us.
And Dhananand will die.
Dhananand has ruined our
lives and he has broken our kingdom.
He separated me from
my husband and from my child!
He took me away from my people,
my army!
The people and the soldiers
that were my family!
But the parts that
were scattered 12 years ago
now have been brought together!
And now this great family
will lay down the foundations
of a great land of Bharat!
My son, your Prince
will stand by Acharya Chanakya
and bring forth a new era in history!
The teacher and his disciple
will establish a new Bharat!
And it will begin
by breaking apart
the reign of Dhananand!
Our enemies will fall
and Bharat stands tall!
Our enemies will fall
and Bharat stands tall!
Our enemies will fall
and Bharat stands tall!
Our enemies will fall
and Bharat stands tall!
'You wished to know who
I have chosen to end you?'
'One who will rule
the great land of Bharat.'
'Then hear me.'
'My student is as stubborn as I am.'
'He will not stop'
'till he kills you.'
Chanakya!
Who do put forth against me?
Who is it?
Today, it is not your mother
but the Queen Mother
of Piplivan that blesses you.
And as a blessing
I hand you the continuing war
and his invincible sword.
I have complete faith
that you will carve a chapter
in history by this sword
that will inspire generations
to be devoted to the motherland!
Remember this well, Chandragupta.
This blessing is not just
for the Prince of Piplivan.
Nor for the future king of Piplivan!
This blessing is
for the faith and valour
that runs in the veins
all of all warriors here.
Accept this blessing as an oath.
And you must stay determined.
You must swear an oath,
Chandragupta Maurya.
Swear an oath, Chandragupta.
And say that you..
I am the son of
Lord Chandravardhan Maurya
and Queen Mura of Piplivan.
Holding my ancestors
and my teacher as witness..
I swear an oath
that by mind, actions and words
I will always be
determined to my duty.
I will always hold..
My motherland before me.
I would rather die
than live as a slave.
Neither for me nor for my nation.
I will create a great nation!
One that will be an
inspiration for generations.
One by whose very
name our enemies tremble.
And be it an enemy
within our from outside!
"Chandragupta Maurya!
Chandragupta Maurya!"
I, Chandragupta Maurya
will bring forth
the great land of united Bharat!
The great land of united Bharat!
- Hail Chandragupta Maurya!
- Hail!
- Hail Chandragupta Maurya!
- Hail!
- Hail Chandragupta Maurya!
- Hail!
- Hail the coming ruler of Bharat!
- Hail!
- Hail Prince Chandragupta Maurya!
- Hail!
- Hail Prince Chandragupta Maurya!
- Hail!
- Hail Prince Chandragupta Maurya!
- Hail!
Do you see this dew drop?
The existence of this
drop amounts to fall short
even to quench someone's thirst.
But if countless drops come together
they can become a mighty river
and a river
can become a mighty sea!
And all life comes from the sea.
But if this very sea wills it..
It can destroy the world.
So one must not underestimate unity.
Since the same drops,
come together as a sea
and thus bring ruin!
My ethics..
Your destiny.
We shall not attack
Assaka from one direction.
We shall attack them
at multiple places.
Before they will be able to
realize that they have been attacked
we will make them our slaves.
The time has come Chandragupta
for a battle between your
Kshatriya army and Dhananand.

================================================================================

Episode: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPPzpCDy8TA

When a king meets anther
king at such a peculiar hour
then one can assume
that the situation is grave.
Tell me, King Dhananand.
What brings you here at this hour?
I am here with an intention
to end all the conflicts
differences and rivalry between us,
Seleucus.
I am here to tell you everything
that was kept secret from you.
You must have heard
about it and it is true
that my arch-enemy,
Chanakya has escaped.
Not just that. After the invasion
I had enslaved Queen Mura
and Chanakya has freed
her as well. Also..
For the past 12 years,
I kept the warriors
of Piplivan as workers
in an isolated place.
Chanakya has freed them as well.
'Your Majesty, Chanakya
took everyone along with him..'
He is planning to build
an army against me.
Ironic!
The King of Magadh
is being very honest today.
Thank you for the humble gesture,
Your Majesty.
Truly, you have graced me
with utmost respect today.
I have revealed my secrets
to you but that does not mean
that you're a righteous person.
But today I am not here
to talk about our misdeeds.
I am here to tell you,
in order to win 15 provinces
we need to collaborate to form
a steadfast and strong team.
We need to trust each other.
Our treaty has become
very important now.
I know, Your Majesty.
You will become the
strongest king in this nation
if you acquire these 15 provinces.
And then, even the strongest
warrior will fear you.
No one will dare to oppose you.
It is so easy to
converse with a wise man
my dear friend.
Why the delay?
Let us device the plan
and prepare for the battle
so that we attack Assaka
at the earliest and conquer it.
We cannot let them conquer Assaka.
In India, apart from Magadh, Assaka is
the largest and most powerful state.
If Dhananand and Seleucus conquer it
it will be impossible to defeat them.
We have to stop them at any cost.
So, I will personally go and
meet the king of Assaka Vajrabahu.
I shall warn him about
the impending onslaught.
Acharya!
You are planning
a war strategy over here
and you sent me away to steal mangoes
from the farms of Magadh!
I have been subjected
to such discrimination. Why?
Who said that your
role is not important?
You have carried out
a very important task.
These mangoes are not
mere fruits they are weapons.
A weapon that can change
the course of the upcoming battle.
But how?
Because the king of Assaka
Vajrabahu, is very fond of mangoes.
Very soon, Acharya Chanakya
will get an opportunity to meet him
with a reason to present
these mangoes to King Vajrabahu.
Remember this, during a battle
such small gestures determine
significant results.
That is brilliant, Acharya. Brilliant.
But, Acharya..
Before you set off to meet him,
we need to find out
how Dhananand and Seleucus
are planning to strike.
It's challenging to conquer
Assaka because of a particular reason
due to which no one has ever
conquered it and the reason is..
Assaka's powerful army
that is always vigilant
and its subjects.
Yes, my friend.
Everyone in the kingdom
is trained to have combat skills.
That is the reason why Assaka
has the power to defeat every attack.
You are right.
We shall not attack
Assaka from one direction.
We shall attack them at
multiple places at the same time.
If Assaka is attacked
from two directions
Assaka kingdom will
have to split their army.
No matter how trained their army is
they will not be able to
fight at the battle for a long time
due to the splitting of their army.
My army shall attack from here
near the banks of the river.
And your army shall infiltrate
through the mountain region.
Acharya..
If Seleucus and Dhananand
strike with this strategy
then let alone Assaka
even we will not
be able to defeat them.
That is why I am planning
to break the alliance
between Dhananand and Seleucus.
To make them weak.
At any cost
we will have to stop Seleucus
and Dhananand's army
from teaming up together.
We will be benefitted
in two ways by it.
First one is, Assaka's army
will easily defeat Seleucus' army.
As a result of that Seleucus
will return to Takshashila.
And the second benefit is after
Dhananand loses Seleucus' support
we will easily defeat
him by joining hands
with the infantry of the Assaka army.
Acharya, I am waiting for the moment
when I am up against Dhananand
in the battle field
glaring into his eyes.
Chandragupta, I respect your feelings.
But battles cannot be
fought with just feelings.
Have you ever thought about
how you are going to defeat
the powerful and heavily
armed army of the Magadh Kingdom?
I understand what you
are pointing at, Acharya.
Though we do have powerful warriors
but they do not have enough
weapons to fight a battle even now.
This is going to
be a large scale battle.
We will need a lot
of weapons for this battle.
The Yavan army has been
fighting battles since many years.
And we have no shortage of weapons.
I hope that even Magadh,
too, has enough weapons.
My friend,
evidence does not need proof.
You might have got an idea how
prepared Magadh is for this battle.
Weapons for the Magadh army
are made with the special
metal from Bundelkhand.
In front of these weapons
all the weapons in this world
do not stand a chance.
Let alone the Assaka army
no army in this world can
survive in front of the powerful army
and the powerful weapons
of the Magadh Kingdom.
To stop the Magadh
army from reaching Assaka
we will have to arm
ourselves with weapons.
To accomplish that
our first step would be to acquire
those special weapons
made in Bundelkhand
which are going to
Magadh from Bundelkhand.
Before they reach Magadh
we will have to acquire them.
Undoubtedly, the security of
such special weapons will be special.
We will have to attack
in a well-planned manner.
I have a plan, though.
But maybe this plan will not match
your principles and
the duty of a warrior.
My plan is not to fight
with the soldiers of Magadh.
In fact, it is to rob their weapons
by hoodwinking them.
The victory is certain
if you people approve of this plan.
Agnimukh,
I know that you are a warrior
and maybe the warrior inside
you will not like this way.
But if the motherland is in danger
then we should not care about the way.
Those weapons of Dhananand
are very important for
us to get victory in this battle.
We will have to get them at any cost.
No matter which way we choose.
You are absolutely right, Chanakya.
I completely trust
your thoughts and the
courage of our prince.
Okay, then..
Tonight
we will rob those special
weapons of Dhananand.
We have counted the weapons again,
Commander Bhadrasaal.
- The count is right.
- Excellent.
We will have to count the weapons
again and again at every step.
Not even a single weapon
should be misplaced.
Yes, Commander.
Be ready.
We have to steal
the weapons from here.
Will it be right for me
to drink liquor in this situation?
It is my responsibility
to take these special weapons
to the armoury of the palace.
The number of soldiers present here
is more than the number of weapons.
Do not worry. Nothing will happen.
And do not forget
that you are with the brother
of His Highness right now.
So, take advantage and
pleasure of this opportunity.
Take it.
For the victory of His Highness.
Attack!
'Our plan is very simple.'
'When Agnimukh distracts the
soldiers of Magadh by his attack'
'and separates them from their camp'
'I will steal those weapons behind their
back with our remaining soldiers.'
Come on!
Back off! Get back!
Chase them!
Bhadrasaal, we cannot leave
those weapons there like this.
You just go back to the camp.
All the weapons are there
and we all are here.
This is definitely
a trick of the enemy.
- Go!
- Let's go!
Chandra, make it fast!
Bhadrasaal is coming back here!
I will have to quickly distract him.
Go!
The work is done.
But, Chandra
- what's all this?
- I will explain to you later.
Let's go.
The cowards have escaped!
Ensure all the weapons are safe!
The emperor will not forgive
anyone of us otherwise.
Go!
Your Majesty..
You need not say anything.
Those Kshatriyas
did what they wanted to!
But I am glad
that you both have
made their efforts fail.
- Chandragupta.
- Yes?
What happened that
Acharya is smiling today?
With just three Bundelkhandi
swords and two spears
we robbed all their
specially equipped weapons.
We replaced all the weapons
over there with low quality weapons.
The Magadh army will get to know this
only on the battle field.
But, Acharya
when Dhananand gets to
know his weapons have been stolen
- he will start fuming.
- No.
No such thing will happen.
Because I have done
the needful by making
Kaivarta and Bhadrasaal
confident about themselves.
Your Majesty,
the Kshatriya army was in an attempt
to rob the swords and spears
by using the panic there.
But our commander,
Bhadrasaal, stopped them.
Yes, Your Majesty.
And all our weapons are safe.
Here, Your Majesty.
You may check yourself.
Undoubtedly, this sharpness
is of the Bundelkhandi iron.
Well done, Chandragupta.
Oh, Chandra.
No wonder you left
those weapons behind
- intentionally.
- Yes.
So that they are in a delusion
that all their remaining
weapons are safe.
Because at times
even a single clay particle
is enough to spoil the vision.
This is definitely
a great victory for us
but we should not become careless.
Because Dhananand will
not be careless either.
Be cautious.
Those Kshatriyas will surely
try to attack us once again.
And now
there is someone guiding them, too.
We have to find out who he is!
Soon!
Very soon!
The millstone is a very simple tool.
It has two ordinary stones
coordinating with each other
and the wheat gets
ground into fine flour.
Be it war or life
it's these simple tools and plans
which yield the best result.
Just as these two
stones of the millstone.
If you too maintain
harmony with the others in life
you will get the best results.
My ethics..
Your destiny.
I am also ready for the war.
Order me which legion I should join.
I see glimpse of a
revolutionary of a traitor.
And there is no place for
a revolutionary on the battlefield!

Hey, where did the roti,
that I just gave, vanish?
Please wait,
I will get you another one.
No, Mother. That is not required.
Indra has tricked to pull a prank.
Come on, get back the roti.
Amazing!
How did you do that?
Can you do it once again?
Recreation time is over.
Chandragupta!
Now, you don't have to stay in
Dhananand's palace as a servant.
It's time for you to
show up in your true form
against your enemy, in the war field.
We have to start
your training to do so.
Okay, Acharya.
I am ready for the
war skills training.
No matter I get tired or shattered,
but it is definite
that I am ready to
face Dhananand in war.
Okay.
Your war skills training
will start at dawn tomorrow.
"The flame of revenge,
and the will of steel."
"The flame of revenge,
and the will of steel."
"If you have the courage
then we can lift the sun."
"You have to walk on
the sharpness of the sword."
"With the arrows of
bravery kill the enemy."
"Will defeat the enemy,
to unite my homeland.."
"Will defeat the enemy,
to unite my homeland.."
"Will defeat the enemy,
to unite my homeland.."
"Will defeat the enemy,
to unite my homeland.."
Matsadev!
Neither do we fear death,
nor do we love our lives..
Victory or martyr..
This is Piplivan's policy.
This is Piplivan's policy.
This is Piplivan's policy.
"Oh! Chandragupta Maurya."
"Swear to you by the homeland.."
"By the nation's security."
"For mother and the motherland."
"For the teachings of ancestors."
"Don't get back.
You have to move forward."
"With the fire of revenge
you have to melt Himalaya."
"You should have the enthusiasm
to make the sky bow."
Neither do we fear death,
nor do we love our lives..
Victory or martyr..
This is Piplivan's policy.
This is Piplivan's policy.
This is Piplivan's policy.
This is unfair.
I was resting, Acharya.
When one becomes a king, Chandragupta
the word 'rest' is deleted
from his dictionary.
You will have to focus
on your target, always.
You are destined to be the
future emperor of United Bharat
so you have to be alert
and cautious every moment.
Because you have not one,
but two enemies.
Dhananand and Selucus.
"Will defeat the enemy,
to unite my homeland.."
"Will defeat the enemy,
to unite my homeland.."
"Oh! Chandragupta Maurya."
Congratulations,
prince Chandragupta Maurya.
You are capable to train
and lead your army now.
But your training will
continue in the same way.
Now, according to our plan
you will have to return
to Dhananand's palace immediately.
[Sanskrit shlok]
[Sanskrit shlok]
[Sanskrit shlok]
Emerge victorious.
[Sanskrit shlok]
It is time now, Chandragupta.
Now, you will have to assure Dhananand
that you are ready to become
a part of Magadha's army.
If this happens
we will know Dhananand's
every move in advance.
We will know when he will
attack and from which direction.
But you will have to do this
task carefully as well as soon
so that we can stop the Magadh
army before they reach Asaka.
Okay, Acharya.
Brother.
- What am I hearing?
- What?
All of you are going for
a war and you are not taking me.
But I am sure
that you will take your favourite
servant with you. Isn't it?
I have not finished talking yet.
Sometimes, I feel like dying.
And taking rebirth.
I want to be reborn as a maid.
That is when I can get
an important place in your life.
Isn't it?
My dear sister!
You know what you mean to me.
This is a battlefield
and not a playground.
There is risk here.
And you
are very special to me.
I cannot risk your life.
Is this the only reason?
Prove it to me.
Leave that servant here.
You will not do this, right?
I knew that you would take him along.
Durdhara, stop.
Durdhara.
Why does my sister keep comparing
herself with that ordinary servant?
King Dhananand
you can control anybody
in this world but
not your dear sister.
Chandragupta,
our paths will be different from here.
You will go to Dhananand's palace
and I will go to the King of Asaka.
to warn him about the attack
Even though our paths
are going to be different
but our aim is the same.
Freedom of our motherland.
May the enemies be destroyed.
My united India will be the greatest.
Stealing the weapon is
just the beginning, Dhananand.
Now, your favourite
servant will stay with you
and find out your strategy
and he will make you
weak from within in the war
and destroy you completely.
Make sure that all
the weapons are here.
'I had expected this.'
'After the Kshatriyas of Piplivan ran'
'and the fire of their revolution'
'Dhananand has become
more eager and stubborn'
'to acquire the 15 districts.'
'I will have to be very
close to Dhananand in this war'
'so that I can find out all
the strategies and plans of this war'
'and defeat the wicked king.'
These are special
weapons from Bundelkhand.
Be extra careful about them.
'We have stolen all their
special weapons from Bundelkhand'
'apart from three swords
from Bundelkhand and two swords.'
'And I have exchanged all the weapons
with inferior quality weapons.'
'Now, Magadh's army will realise this'
'only on the battlefield.'
Servant, why are you smiling?
Calm down.
We will not lose the war if I smile.
So, keep smiling and be happy.
Somebody was right in saying
like king, like people.
My sister, Durdhara, should get a room
in Hawa Mahal similar
to the one in this palace
so that she does not find
the atmosphere over there different.
My sister should
be happy and safe there
till the war ends.
Now go!
Greetings, Your Majesty.
I am also ready for the war.
Order me which legion I should join.
Anyway, Your Majesty,
I hope to be near you in the war
with you as your shadow to
make sure no danger befalls you.
Good! Very good!
I have decided the best place for you.
I think you should..
Servant
the mark of slavery
that you were marked with
on your shoulder in my gold mines..
Have you removed it?
Yes, Your Majesty, do not worry.
It did not hurt to remove it
as much as it seems.
I am not worried about your pain.
The thought that troubles me
is that you are a mere slave.
I see glimpse of
a revolutionary of a traitor.
I see glimpse of
a revolutionary of a traitor.
And there is no place for
a revolutionary on the battlefield!
What are you saying, Your Majesty?
You know how loyal I am to you.
I do but you will not go
to the battlefield either way.
I have thought of a better
and more important task.
Until the war ends,
my sister, Durdhara
will not be here but in Hawa Palace
and you will protect her over there.
Your Majesty, I can be of
help to you in the battlefield.
As far as the protection
of Princess Durdhara
is concerned,
any soldier here can do it.
Be careful, slave.
You are talking about
my sister's protection.
It is more important to me
than winning over 15 states.
I do not want that Chanakya to target
my sister to win the war against me.
Only rebellious slave can
protect a rebellious princess.
And then I can go to
war without any worries.
Now leave.
Why are you still here?
Should I assume this
your rebellious behaviours?
No, Your Majesty,
I will go to
Princess Durdhara right away.
'Oh, God! What now?'
'According to Archarya's strategy,
I had to go to war with Dhananand'
'and find out about
this strategy there.'
'How do I help Acharya now?'
Problems always come unannounced.
Enemies never attack with permission.
Whenever you get
into such odd problems
panicking never works.
Being calm and thinking
it out is the key.
Find a solution
that gives you a bit of time.
[Sanskrit shlok]
[Sanskrit shlok]
And in the short time
find the best solution to deal
with the problem and prove yourself.
My ethics..
Your destiny.
That slave, Chandragupta..
He is Mura's son.
He is the prince of Piplivan.
Your Highness!
Your Highness!

================================================================================

Episode: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgmtWyL9hRQ

'Dhananand got me held up
by ordering to stay at Hawa Mahal.'
'He confined me to this place.'
'How do I help Acharya
from the battlefield?'
'I have to find a solution
to this problem soon'
'or else God knows what else
will obstruct me in this palace.'
Do you know what, Mother?
The army of Magadh gets
ready for a war again after years.
In this tough circumstance
all of us as well as His Majesty,
feel your absence.
I hope the special Unani medicine
given to you is effective
and you would get well quickly.
What happened, Chandragupta?
Why do you seem so worried?
I have been ordered to protect
the princess until the war ends.
His Majesty wants me
to take her to Hawa Mahal.
Really? That is a great news!
Her Highness must
be happy to hear that.
So you should be
happy about it as well.
It is not something too happy about.
I should be in the battlefield,
with His Majesty.
But no!
My job is to protect that
soft princess, that is it.
Do you know what?
You are smart,
adept and skilled in everything.
But you are a fool when
it comes to Her Highness.
You do not understand her.
What is there about her to understand?
She is an arrogant and proud princess,
that is all.
She dreams to marry a wealthy prince
of a huge kingdom.
Nothing else.
'After Dhananand's death,
the entire India will have'
'only one kingdom and one king.'
'The Prince of Piplivan,
Chandragupta Maurya.'
'I always suspected you.'
'I suspected you and Mura!'
'But now your lie has been exposed!'
'I want you to be tortured
very harshly before you die'
'that death will seem easy for you.'
'Come on then, Your Highness.'
Shipra..
I do not understand what are you
trying to tell me about the princess.
Anyway
I do not have time
for all that right now.
I should just go to her
and tell her to get ready.
That is it.
Really, you are a fool.
Mother..
Mother..
Mother..
Mother..
That slave, Chandragupta..
He is Mura's son.
He is the prince of Piplivan.
Slave, you know that I bathe
only with rose water on full moon day.
How could you forget that?
What the heck are you doing!
Forgive me, Your Highness.
Go and bring it!
Seeing all this, it seems
you are going to Hawa Mahal forever
and not for a few days, Your Highness.
So my mysterious slave is here.
Looking at you,
you do not seem to have any
experience with wars.
A battle is undetermined.
It can wage up to a few days,
months or years.
I hope that you are
ready to protect me.
No, not at all.
I have many important tasks
than roaming around
you at the Hawa Mahal.
It is more important
for me to complete them.
If you have so many important tasks
then you cannot accompany
me to Hawa Mahal.
- I will tell my brother..
- Yes..
Tell him.
All right, I will accompany you.
Tell the king that I have
grown undisciplined and bad.
How will I be able
to take care of you?
Please come. Go and tell him.
- Come with me..
- Stop.
No.
I know that you want to
be free of your responsibility.
But you cannot be
free from it so soon.
Until the war ends,
you will have to protect me.
Not only protection
you have to entertain me as well.
The king will not be there,
so he cannot order us.
You will be completely focused on me.
You will have to follow my orders.
Did you get it?
I have been trapped.
What did you say? Tell me.
No, I said nothing, Princess.
I was thinking about
my new responsibility.
It is good.
Even I was thinking the same.
By the way..
I hope that Shipra will accompany me.
Where is she?
Your Highness!
You?
I heard a woman's voice.
I had called you, Your Highness.
Actually, your magnificence
and amazing glory makes me nervous.
Due to nervousness, I was choked.
Tell me. What do you want?
Shall I tell you?
Your Highness, actually..
Will you hurry up?
I have to leave to prepare for war.
That is it! The war!
Your Highness, I have to tell
you something important about the war.
'What do I tell this insane king?'
'What excuse shall I give?'
'If he suspects me'
'he will kill us all with his razor.'
Where is Shipra?
She takes care of all my things.
She knows my routine.
I hope the servants
have packed my velvet shoes.
And my bear fur gloves..
Also, my peacock feather brushes.
I need them for painting.
I will not be able to live
at Hawamahal without them.
'My army is waiting for me'
'and this obnoxious princess'
'is wasting my time after
her insignificant things.'
'On one hand, it is India's future'
'and on the other,
her insignificant things.'
Slave!
Did you even listen to what I said?
I asked you for Shipra's whereabouts.
She should have been here by now!
Where is she?
Princess, Shipra always tails you.
She cannot stay away
from you for long.
She must be on her way.
Shall we go?
Perhaps, I will not need to wait
for the war to use my razor.
Forgive me, Your Highness.
I know that your time is precious.
That too now,
when Magadh is ready to wage war.
I want to request you something.
All the warriors will leave for war.
In your absence
the palace will be empty.
I believe that you will not
let me accompany you to the battle.
So, if you find it right..
Shall I go to the
Hawa Mahal with the princess?
I will keep her happy
with my culinary skills.
All right. Go to Hawa Mahal.
Your presence will entertain Durdhara.
All right, Your Highness.
Thank you, king. Thank you.
You are very kind and merciful.
I assure you that I will
leave no stone unturned
- in serving the princess.
- Enough!
You are so slow, despicable
and unworthy of walking beside me!
Do not even dare to walk beside me!
'I was spared.'
Oh, Lord.
I have to become the cook
of that arrogant princess.
Well done.
All of you are not children
but the warriors of Assaka!
You will trample
upon the army of Magadh.
You will prove to the world
that if a warrior's pride is great
then the age does not matter.
If Assaka is independent
it is because of the
strength of its subjects
and not the king.
Today, the king and his subjects
will not let Assaka be written off
2as a defeated kingdom
in the pages of history.
We will protect our kingdom
until we breathe our last!
Either independence or death!
Either independence or death!
Either independence or death!
Either independence or death!
Either independence or death!
I, Commander Jangidev,
greet thee, King of Assaka.
I apologise for interrupting
your teaching session
but a guest is waiting for you.
The army of Magadh
can attack us at any time.
In this situation, I do not
have time to entertain a guest.
King Vajrabahu!
Acharya Chanakya,
what are you doing here?
Greeting, Your Highness.
It is my good fortune
that you came to my kingdom.
Acharya, you can see that as a king
I have to fulfill my royal duties.
To protect my kingdom and subjects
I have to make many arrangements.
- Moreover..
- Your Highness..
Bhairav!
Please accept my small gift.
If you find some
time from your training
then do taste these
sweet and juicy mangoes
from Magadh.
You are skilled in getting
the things your way, Acharya.
A human's greatest strength
is to know the opponent's weakness.
'With the support of Assaka's king'
'our strength against
Dhananand will increase.'
'I hope that Chandragupta
is moving towards his goal.'
Watch your tongue, slave.
I do not need your taunts.
I need Shipra.
Where is she?
'Why have Stulbhadra
and Indra captured Shipra?'
'I am sure a big problem has come up.'
To attain success in life
along with hard work
it is important to
gain small supports.
It is similar to this flag.
It needs
the aid of this rope to climb up.
The rope gives it the strength
to stay aloft in the air.
In the same way
if you have to attain
the heights of success
then make sure to
join with such people
who will not be
jealous of your success
but be happy for you.
Only then will you attain
the heights of success.
My ethics..
Your destiny.
Shipra..

================================================================================

Episode: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rCNGRG7l5s

Where is Shipra?
She is nowhere to be seen.
'Why have Stulbhadra
and Indra captured Shipra?'
'I am sure a big problem has come up.'
Princess. Shipra is your friend.
Where can she be
gone leaving you alone?
All right, you need not worry.
You may meet everyone before
leaving and I will find her.
As far as it goes for your robes
I will arrange for that.
You may rest assured.
A worried look does not suit you well.
You are a brute and bold one
but by your warmth and cunning
you become a good company, slave.
My slave.
For God's sake keep quiet and
give me a chance to explain my point.
What are you doing?
She is not our enemy!
She is our friend.
Leave her be.
Did you see Chandra? I was
telling you that now she is an enemy.
For some moment Bhadrasaal's
mother had gained consciousness.
Before getting unconscious again
she told everything about you.
And your friend is going
to tell everything to the king.
It was good that I and Indra
heard the conversation of
Bhadrasaal's mother and Shipra.
And stopped from going to the king.
Shipra, all I can say at this time is
that I am not responsible
for the condition of your mother.
That was just an accident.
And I have reason
for the remaining things.
But now I do not have adequate time.
One day I will surely tell you.
But now the battlefield is calling me.
She is alive but simply passed out.
Chandra, I get scared
by seeing the skill
Acharya taught you.
We cannot leave her in the palace.
Once she wakes up she
will reveal everything.
I know.
I have a way to deal with her.
In order to keep her hidden
I must take her with me to the palace.
Everyone in the palace
is getting ready for war.
So how will keep her
hidden from everyone?
Right inside the palace?
I know.
I have a way out.
Come with me.
Acharya.
It seems Indra and I have much
to learn from you.
Just come back soon
from Assaka.
Acharya, your suggestion
to take a rest from training
and enjoy these mangoes from Magadh,
is truly great.
Sire, I am being honest..
It brings me great joy
to see you enjoying the fruits.
I am most pleased.
But my heart does ache.
Since the land that bears
these mangoes you relish
might soon be ruled
by a foreign invader.
Dhananand is no foreigner.
He is from the same land.
He is an ill name
to counted amongst kings.
But soon he will be defeated by us.
And these mangoes
will be known by Assaka.
As Magadh will be the dominion
of the Kingdom of Assaka.
Forgive me, Sire.
You are making a mistake.
And your kingdom
might have to pay for it
in the battlefield.
What do you mean?
I mean to say..
That you think Assaka
has only one enemy
that you see as Dhananand.
The truth is something else.
Assaka has two enemies and not one.
One that is even
mightier than Dhananand.
A foreigner.
Emperor of Macedonia!
Seleucus Nicator.
One that moves from the west
marching with a mighty
legion to Assaka.
An army that fights
with a style and weapons
that you know nothing about.
Yes, Sire.
I am telling the truth.
Dhananand and Seleucus have a treaty.
And using that treaty
Dhananand's forces and the Greeks
will launch an attack
on Assaka on two fronts.
Sire, I know that
you are a brave warrior.
And the great land of Assaka
is full of warriors.
But even you know well
that if an attack comes from two sides
then Assaka's army is
not prepared for such assault
and if you want your
kingdom and your army
to be safe from Seleucus
and Dhananand's rage
then you must forge an alliance
with a prince that
will ensure your victory.
What Prince do you speak of, Acharya?
One that will lead
the warriors of Piplivan
against the forces of Dhananand.
The Crown Prince of Piplivan,
Chandragupta Maurya.
What? The Princess
is fond of this carpet
and it has not been loaded yet?
Forgive us.
We will load it right away.
Leave it be. No need for that.
I will look after the Princess.
You may go and check
the other arrangements.
Make haste.
You must load this
carpet on the chariot
that has Durdhara's belongings.
Only then we can take
Shipra to Hawa Mahal
while keeping Shipra
hidden from everyone.
Slave!
Hide!
Yes, my Princess.
We must leave.
The cart and the chariot is ready.
Everyone is waiting for us.
Make haste.
Yes, Your Highness. I will be
right there once I load this carpet.
You may proceed.
'I never knew earlier but now I know
how much you care for me, Slave.'
'And hence you look
after all my belongings.'
Indra.
Go and tell the army of Piplivan
that it will take
me a while to be there.
But they must be prepared for war.
You have to tell them
that the forces of Magadh
will strike Assaka from the east,
through hills.
I will be there within six hours
after I deal with the events here.
- All right.
- Yes, Chandra.
Chandra, do not be late.
It all depends on you being there.
Yes, I know. You must go at once.
- Yes.
- Go.
Now we just have to get
this carpet on that chariot.
One that carries
Durdhara's belongings.
The Crown Prince of Piplivan!
The son of King Chandravardhan
and Queen Mura is alive?
Yes, Sire. He is alive.
And he is the one who
can dethrone Dhananand.
And he will uphold my oath.
'You have mocked
this tuft of my hair.'
'I swear upon this tuft'
'that I will bring
ruin to the line of Nanda!'
'I will cast you out of that throne!'
'And I will bring
forth a capable ruler!'
I have chosen him as the one who
will rule the great land of Bharat!
So now I see it all.
You and Chandragupta
seek to rule Magadh.
A priest has to fulfill his oath
and a prince wants revenge
for his kingdom and family.
Is that all?
Forgive me, Sire.
Neither my line of
thinking has stooped so low
now my dream is so limited.
I say this with great regret
that this is the mindset
that keeps us restrained.
We are always occupied
thinking of our own selves.
And that brings the fall
of the nation as a whole.
But right now,
it is not about my personal oath
or the revenge of Chandragupta Maurya.
Here we speak of the nation.
For the coming future!
What do you think?
That Seleucus and
Dhananand will be satisfied
after conquering the land of Assaka?
No, great King!
Then they will seek to rule
other kingdoms after defeating you.
And if they are not stopped
right here, Lord of Assaka.
Then soon will dawn a day
when all of Bharat is
ruled by the invader Seleucus
and that tyrant Dhananand!
They will have the
nation under their clasp!
The proposal that I bring to you now
is way greater than you and me.
It is way deeper.
This alliance of ours is crucial
for the future of the motherland.
If you and I fail
to come to an agreement
driven by our greed and gains
then history will never forgive us,
great King.
I ask you to forgive me
as I doubted your will, Acharya.
Even if we forge this alliance
would we be able to do anything?
Acharya, I think that it is too late.
The armies of the Greeks and Magadh
can assault Assaka any moment now.
And it is impossible
to stop such an army.
Great King, if one's will is pure
then a way presents itself.
We have such a way here.
And this move has been set in motion.
You just have to do one thing.
You just have to turn
your armies from north to west.
Since Seleucus will strike from there.
You may rest assured
on the front of Dhananand.
Since Chandragupta
and I will hold him back.
Your army has to defeat
Seleucus at any cost.
After you defeat Seleucus
he will turn back to Takshshila
and he will have no other way out.
And then the army of Assaka
and warriors of Piplivan
will defeat Dhananand
with their combined might.
Dhananand will be caught
between two great forces.
But will you assist me
in this move of mine?
You have to decide right now at once.
Tell me
will you fight with me or not?
Seleucus and Dhananand
are ready to strike Assaka.
I must reach my army in time.
Stul, just as we reach
the Hawamahal palace..
I will trick Durdhara and leave.
And I will reach my army.
Attention! Lord Dhananand,
ruler of Magadh has arrived!
Shipra..
She went ahead.
She went ahead? Why is that?
To set your chambers before you reach.
So that you face no trouble
once you reach Hawa Mahal.
Did you see that, Brother?
As long as I have a friend like Shipra
and a slave like Chandragupta
you need not worry about me.
And yet I will be worried for you,
as I go in war so I have decided that
Brother Kovishanka
will leave with you.
Brother..
Why does Brother Kovishanka
need to come
with me to the palace of Hawa Mahal?
Yes, my Lord.
Why do you trouble him?
I can take good care of the Princess.
Slave, you are merely
seeing the huge form
and the slow pace of my brother.
But you do not know
that even if he is
slow as your friend here
but his cunning is unrivalled.
He can sense a threat at the earliest.
And I need someone like him
to keep my sister safe.
Why is this carpet
kept here in this cart?
I feel strange seeing it here.
It appears to be heavier than usual.
'Kovishanka has begun doubting!'
'I am in trouble now.'
I know we never got together
but today I wish to begin
a new chapter of our friendship.
But I have a condition
that you will not
meddle in my affairs.
Even if it is my carpet.
I am quite fond of it.
And it will go to
Hawa Mahal along with me.
No matter how heavy it is.
I cannot refuse
the dear sister of the emperor.
Brother, you need not be angry.
Durdhara is your sister as well.
And now even you must protect Durdhara
just as my dear slave does.
And that you have great comfort
and to keep you well fed
I am sending my skilled
cook along with you.
My dear sister.
Take care.
Slave!
Always stay on guard!
No harm should come to my sister.
Yes, my Lord.
Shipra and I have a lot
of memories in Hawa Mahal.
I am eager to meet Shipra.
'No matter how many
hurdles you push before me'
'but you can never stop me,
Dhananand.'
'I give you my word.'
'We will meet in the battlefield.'
Just as every tree in
this forest has deep roots
similarly, we all have secrets
that not many know.
And if you know such
a secret of the enemy
then it can be your
great strength in a war.
Remember well.
In order to win a war
one must know the power
of the enemy that is visible
but so it is crucial
to know about things
that are not visible and stay hidden.
By gathering more
information on the enemy
you can then dominate the enemy.
My ethics..
Your destiny.
Slave? You?
Not slave. I am your death!
I am the Crown prince of Piplivan,
Chandragupta Maurya.

================================================================================

Episode: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fcRb1JjLvs

Hawa Mahal!
There is lovely wind
blowing across the palace.
Me and Shipra often
used to spend the afternoons
contemplating peacocks
and other birds.
I have seen them squeak
and dance in the grove.
Where is Shipra by the way?
P-Princess,
she went to get you scented flowers
to embellish your room.
I-I forgot to get you a present.
I will be right back.
Get back to work.
- A moment, Slave.
- Hold on a moment, Slave.
I have some chores to be done as well.
Chandragupta has departed
for Hawa Mahal with Durdhara.
He said, he will definitely
be here in the afternoon.
The Clan of Magadh will depart soon.
But before that, Dhananand's clan
will merge with Seleucus's army
to win over Asaka.
We need to stop Dhananand's clan.
We will only have a limited
window of opportunity.
If the two clans
merge into an alliance
Dhananand will become invincible.
And without Chandragupta's leadership
our clan will be low in morale,
Your Highness.
Chandragupta is a man of his word.
Regardless of obstacles, if any.
Have faith in the prince
and your objective.
An objective which
will soon be fulfilled.
I hope you arrive soon, Chandragupta.
Y-Yes, certainly. Please hurry up,
I have to be somewhere.
Have patience, Slave.
I want a bagful of sweets
and several pillows in my room.
And this is a list
of herbs for my hair.
I need them in the right
amount and with appropriate dosage.
There are a also few
herbs listed for digestion.
I also want cold, luke warm and
hot water separately in my bathroom.
Arrange for a spittoon on the right
and a plate of betel
on the left side of my bed.
'Oh, God!
Brother Govi's chores will take'
'will take all his time and energy.'
Four musicians for my entertainment
and a masseuse, four times a day.
That will be all for now.
Will you be able to handle?
Yes, but since I am only a human
it will take me several hours.
Do you have someone else to attend?
Yes, Brother Govi.
Can he do a job for me before
getting started with your chores?
It is a request.
Yes, indeed.
Thank you. Slave, come with me.
I shall tell you your task.
Come on.
'I have no idea what is she up to.'
Acharya. Taking your
advice into consideration
I have shifted my army
from north to west.
At the same time I expect that
your warriors and the would be king
will prevent the army of Magadh
from merging with Seleucus's army.
Do not worry, Your Highness.
The warriors of Piplivan
and Prince Chandragupta
are well aware of the fact
that if we don't stop Dhanananda now
then the history of India
will change with the change in time.
And they won't let that happen.
Slave, you do not know Brother Govi.
Many of the slaves has
left the palace because of him.
And unfortunately you are
next in his list.
Now he won't leave
you alone for a moment
but I've found the
remedy of this situation.
Thank you, Princess.
You have interpreted my discomfort.
Thanks a ton.
I don't want to stay
with him even for a moment.
I know. I'm quite aware.
That is why I am doing this.
What's the matter, Princess?
Slave, bring me some water.
I'll bring it right away.
Princess!
Princess, let me go. Open the door.
I shall not let you go away
due to Brother Govi, slave.
'How'll I get to the
warriors of Piplivan now?'
The afternoon is about to end
and we need to leave for
the war as soon as possible.
But Prince Chandragupta
is nowhere to be found.
The importance of time
is foremost in war, Chandragupta.
If we don't act in time
it becomes our enemy.
And victory is inevitable
if the time is on our side or else
no one can save this country
from the upcoming demolition.
Attention!
This is to inform
the citizens to Magadh
that under the leadership
of King Dhananand
the army of Magadh
is preparing for war.
The citizens will have
to abide by the rules of the war
till the war is over.
Which is applicable
in the whole of Magadh.
All the rights will be
with the army and the king.
And the citizens will have
to be ready for all kinds of help.
The army of Magadh is so vast
that our enemies are no match to us.
And this time you need
to lift up your spirit
because King Dhananand is going
to lead our army in the war.
- Are we ready?
- Yes, we are!
- Are we ready?
- Yes, we are!
We need to stay alert
in war conditions.
Lift up your shields
and straighten your swords.
Go and get ready.
"Chandragupta. Chandragupta."
Dhananand, here I come to destroy you.
- Hail Emperor Dhananand!
- Hail be to him!
- Hail Emperor Dhananand!
- Hail be to him!
- Hail Emperor Dhananand!
- Hail be to him!
- Hail Emperor Dhananand!
- Hail be to him!
- Hail Emperor Dhananand!
- Hail be to him!
- Hail Emperor Dhananand!
- Hail be to him!
Forgive me, friend Seleucus.
As soon as the prime
fifteen districts of Bharat
merges with Magadh
Dhananand will neither
need you nor your friendship.
My brave soldiers,
today we shall conquer Assaka
our first district in Bharat.
And very soon, the entire Bharat
will be under Macedonia.
And in our regime,
we will take over Bharat
our golden bird!
- Victory be to us!
- Victory be to us!
Oh, God! May I not bump
into that idiot of a prince.
God help me.
Chandra!
Where have you been? I have
been searching for you, Chandra.
Nothing to say.. Anyway.
Forget that.
Tell me. What are you doing here?
At this hour,
you should have been with Govi.
Immediately I have to
reach the army at Piplivan.
Wait, Chandra.
A big trouble has come up.
- What is it?
- I will tell you.
Govishanka..
That man is way too suspicious.
And right now he is
suspicious about that carpet.
Just to divert his attention
I made so many dishes for him
but he is not getting distracted.
He is going on asking
questions about that carpet.
And Chandra, if we do not take
away that carpet away from his sight
then there will be serious trouble.
Okay. You have a point there.
But at this moment,
I have to be at the battlefield.
And if Shipra has her way
and spills the bean in front of
Durdhara and Govishanka
then the battle will not take place..
There will be only destruction.
Okay. First,
we will take stock of this situation.
We need to do it fast
because mother and the Kshatriya army
are waiting for me.
Time is running out,
Commander Matsaldev.
Dhananand and Seleucus
are advancing with their army.
Before Dhananand meets Seleucus
and they crush us,
we need to stop them.
Or else, it will be catastrophe,
Commander.
We cannot wait for the prince.
You need to take a decision.
In the previous battles,
you have lead the army.
I have, Agnimukh
but this battle is different.
This is not only for Piplivan
but for the entire Bharat.
And the viewpoint I have gained
is only as the commander of Piplivan.
At this moment,
we need a Mauryan leader
with a bigger vision
and has the royal bloodline.
I will lead the army.
The Queen?
If a warrior from
the Maurya clan is needed
then why not Queen Mura?
The pace which the army
of Dhananand is advancing
Chandragupta had already
informed me about it.
In the absence of
Chanakya and Chandragupta
I shall lead my army.
Your wish is my command, Queen.
But to lead the army
a person needs to have deft
knowledge and skills of weaponry.
Within five strikes if you disarm me
then I will accept the fact
that I am not worthy
of leading my army.
One, two..
Three..
Forgive me, Queen Mura.
You are worthy of leading our army.
- Hail Queen Mura.
- All hail!
- Hail Queen Mura.
- All hail!
- Hail Queen Mura.
- All hail!
- Hail Queen Mura.
- All hail!
- Hail Queen Mura.
- All hail!
- Hail Queen Mura.
- All hail!
- Hail Queen Mura.
- All hail!
The great Kshatriyas of Piplivan
all of us are standing
here together today
and we will now advance
further from here
for our brave king, Chandravardhan.
For our prince.
All of us will advance
to get back the pride of our past.
For a bright future.
But most importantly
this army will proceed
for a united Bharat.
May the enemies be destroyed.
May my Bharat be united!
May the enemies be destroyed.
May my Bharat be united!
Brother.
This is the golden period
of your life that you are enjoying
by getting a chance to fight a war
with the king of Magadh, Dhananand.
But this is not just
the time to enjoy.
It is also the time to
take up the responsibility.
Prove yourselves
by writing a story of your deeds
by shedding blood on the battlefield
and it will be not just your blood
but the blood of the enemies too.
Rest assured, Your Majesty.
Stop!
Your Majesty,
how will such a huge army
pass through such a narrow place?
This is a war, Brother.
New problems will
arise at every moment.
I want a suggestion and not a problem.
Tell me. What should we do?
Your Majesty, why don't we
divide our army into two groups?
One major part of the army can proceed
through the straight path
under the king's guidance.
And the rest of the army will proceed
with me hrough this narrow part.
Good.
This is a good idea.
Victory will be ours.
- Army!
- Move forward!
Bhairav, increase the speed.
We have to reach Magadh
as soon as possible.
What is the matter, Acharya?
Why are you worried?
Chandragupta must have
joined the army by now.
King of Assaka is also
supporting us against Dhananand.
No doubt!
But I have a doubt
that Dhananand is making
a cruel and wicked plan.
Chandragupta will need my help.
We will have to reach
Magadh before sunset.
Increase the speed.
Amatya Rakshas,
all our plans have succeeded.
I hope our next plans work too
and we can defeat those Kshatriyas.
Everything will work according
to your will, Your Majesty.
Without any doubt!
Very good.
Now, I have to see whether
the seed that I have sowed
gives fruit or not.
Yes.
There are two ways
to win over the enemy.
First
decrease the strength of the enemy.
Second
increase your strength.
But
you can win in both the situations
only when you have correct
knowledge about the enemy's strength.
Remember one thing.
Any war is fought and won in the mind
before the battlefield.
Think carefully before attacking
and follow your strategy
only after that.
My ethics..
Your destiny.
Slave? You?
Not slave. I am your death!
I am the Crown prince of Piplivan,
Chandragupta Maurya.

================================================================================

Episode: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITWC6Nd_ENc

There is something
in this carpet for sure.
I do not suspect things unnecessarily.
There is a reason.
I must check.
- No!
- No!
- Do not touch this!
- Do not touch this!
What! How dare you refuse me!
How dare you lowborn stop me!
No, not at all, My lord!
How could we stop you?
But tell us something.
Why would you do anything
while we are here?
Do not take the trouble.
Just enjoy this delicious food
while we discard this carpet.
It is very heavy,
so I went to bring him for help.
And what about you?
I thought you were
doing what I had asked you.
Yes, Your Highness.
I will take this carpet first
and then finish that.
'You will never see
me again after this'
'as on the battlefield'
'I will kill your brother Dhananand.'
'I will end him.'
Amatya, things are
happening as I had planned.
Now I await the
Kshatriyas from Piplivan.
According to my assumption
the army of Magadh must
be beyond this mountain.
We must reach the peak
and use the opportunity
to face them, fight them and end them!
March ahead!
I cannot waste any more time.
I need to be with my army.
You must ensure that she
does not leave the chamber.
All right?
Why are you two here?
I thought,
you were discarding the carpet.
And who is sleeping here?
May I bring you some food?
Get out of the way!
Let me see.
I am her guard.
And I cannot allow anyone to
insult Durdhara, Princess of Magadh
even if that is her brother.
Oh! So this is Durdhara.
But this is not her chamber.
So why is she here?
She is the princess.
She was sleepy,
so she is sleeping here.
It will be better if
you do not disturb her.
'I need to do something
else to distract him'
'so that I can run away.'
Hey! Who is that?
Oh, this is the Kshatriya Baldev!
The revolutionary Baldev,
the Kshatriya!
Let us go and see.
This..
This sentry is unconscious,
which means
that Baldev is here.
He attacked him and fled.
Please wait here.
I will check right away.
What is happeni..
You?
What are you doing here?
Durdhara, you are here?
You were sleeping, were you not?
This is not the time for questions,
but to stay cautious.
Someone is past our palace's security.
I believe, the one I saw
was in fact Baldev.
Yes, My lord.
The revolutionary Kshatriya!
I feel, he is conspiring against us.
Let me go and check.
You need not go.
The weather is scorching.
And this sentry must be tired.
- But.. - You need not worry
about our enemies in Piplivan
as they cannot come here.
Besides, Dhananand has
laid a dangerous trap for them.
Soon, all of them will be dead.
Brother Pandup..
What army is this that
is marching towards us?
- Victory is precious!
- This is the principle of Piplivan!
'May we be victorious?'
This is the war cry
of Kshatriya of Piplivan.
We must leave from here right away.
With such a small army
we cannot face the Kshatriya.
We cannot fight
against their strength.
Even if we back down now
we are certain to die.
Our brother,
the King, will kill us for fleeing.
So it will be better
if we stay and fight.
And kill as many soldiers as you can.
The King knew that these
soldiers would attack.
He used us as bait for them.
You are right.
We are stuck, with nowhere to go.
So we must fight to stay alive.
As long as you are alive, fight!
Warriors of Magadh,
the enemy is in front of us.
Be ready to fight and
bring victory to Magadh.
'Dhananand has laid
a dangerous trap for them.'
'Soon, all of them will be dead.'
'What trap is this?
I must get there right away.'
Slave! Where are you going?
Stop!
I asked you a question.
I have no time to answer,
Your Highness.
Allow me to leave. I beg of you!
It is important for me
to be somewhere else.
But where are you going?
This is the time of war.
And you want to leave
me alone in such times?
Who will protect me?
Did you forget your duties?
I remember them, Your Highness.
But right now, there are many
others who need me more than you do.
And it is my duty
to protect them as well.
Pardon me.
Stay safe and happy.
Allow me to leave.
But..
What happened to him?
Why did he behave so strangely?
He was speaking
as if this was our last conversation.
'Whatever your plan or strategy is'
'I will foil it.'
"The one who will defeat
the Kshatriyas is Dhananand!"
"The greatest king
of all is Dhananand."
"Dhananand will even defeat Seleucus!"
"Dhananand will
celebrate every night!"
The Kshatriyas of Piplivan
will soon be as dead as a doornail.
Your Highness, what have you planned
for destroying those Kshatriyas?
The term 'Forgiveness'
is foreign to me
and I do not like to
be merciful to the rebels.
If my old enemies
have rebelled against me
then I will make them
rue the day they rebelled.
This time, this rebellion
was instigated y two enemies of mine.
Chanakya and the Mauryas of Piplivan.
I will attack them in such a way
that they will be destroyed together.
I knew that as soon as I would
set out to fight the 15 districts
they would definitely try to deter me.
I let them think the same.
Now, they will try to defeat my army
but attack.. They will not attack me
but I will attack them.
A big.. No..
A huge attack is awaiting them.
The enemy is in front of you.
Be ready!
Attack!
Attack!
The way cattle are used
as bait to hunt a lion
in the same way,
our brother, Dhananand
has used as cannon fodder
to kill these Kshatriyas!
What do you say, Brother Pandup?
Soon, the victory will be ours,
Your Highness.
Your plan has succeeded.
We are overwhelming the enemy.
Soon, Chandragupta will reach here.
What happened, Your Highness?
Did something untoward happen?
Yes, I think something is amiss.
Even though,
they bear the royal symbol of Magadh
they are not the
entire army of Magadh.
This is a small part of the army.
Where is the rest of the army?
Oil?
The ground is splattered with oil!
Why?
Yes, Bhadrasaal.
I, the great conspirator,
Dhananand have used my army
as a bait.
I did it to capture those Kshatriyas.
I want to burn them in
their flames of rebellion.
They will be trampled by their horses.
Foolish Kshatriyas!
How dare they challenge me!
We will reach there in a few moments.
I can hear the screams
of the fighting soldiers.
Go towards the North-East.
Stop!
If the battle is happening
in the North-East
then why is this arrow
coming from the West?
A trap!
Dhananand has set a trap
for the Kshatriyas of Piplivan.
He has planned against them.
They are in danger.
Run!
Now, our brother,
King Dhananand's plan is clear.
He will not let us be cannon fodder.
Look at who is burning
and who will die, Kaivarta.
Fire!
Fire!
Nothing is as lethal as fire
that can burn everything
down to ashes.
Now, this fire will burn down
Chanakya's great Kshatriya forces.
And with them,
the one who was put forth
by Chanakya to challenge me,
will also burn!
The one who was leading
the army of Kshatriyas against me!
Let those Kshatriya
burn to their death.
We should leave, Kaivarta
so that we can join Dhananand's army.
Let us go! Move forward!
Chandra!
- Mother!
- No, Chandra!
Go from here! Chandra, go!
We will handle the situation here.
We will endure it. Go from here!
Go and kill that evil Dhananand!
Do not shirk your duties for us!
Chandra, go! Go and fulfill your duty!
- Go!
- No, Mother!
If killing Dhananand is my duty
then protecting you
all is my duty as well!
We will move forward together!
That is why no matter what happens
I will not them be harmed
as long as I am alive.
Well said, Chandragupta. Well said.
Today, you did not leave
this place at your mother's behest
By doing this, you have made me proud.
You have proved that
I was right to choose you.
You will jump across the fire.
This cloth will protect you.
Send the strongest person
on that side across the fire.
But do remember
that in this endeavour to protect
the Kshatriyas of Piplivan
you should not be harmed.
Promise me, Chandragupta.
Promise me!
The enemies will be destroyed!
My great India will be united!
This spider web is so beautiful.
It is akin to an artist's unique
and heart-warming artwork.
In the darkness, it glows golden
when light falls upon it.
But this beauty turns
out to be dangerous
to those who get
attracted towards it
and become prey to the spider.
The traps set by the
enemies are akin to that.
That is why
if an enemy welcomes you
or presents you with something
be careful while accepting the same.
You do not know
when and which bait
may signal your end.
My ethics..
Your destiny.
Slave? You?
Not slave. I am your death!
I am the Crown prince of Piplivan,
Chandragupta Maurya.

Chandragupta.
Chandragupta.
Chandragupta.
Sire, Agnimukh.
You have to cross this fire.
Sire, Baldev, help me.
Are you all right, Agnimukh?
Please continue. I will be right back.
Mother.
Please help.
Somebody help me.
Chandragupta.
Vishank.
Vishank.
Victory or death!
This is the principle of Piplivan!
Chandragupta.
I had to avoid the shortcut
to teach the vehement
suicide warriors a lesson.
I have to take the long
route to visit Seleucus.
I have wasted both time and energy.
There is only one way
to reach on time, Your Majesty.
The dense forest of Kodihar.
But it will be risky to
cross with such a huge clan.
The travel could be very difficult,
Your Majesty.
Amatya, I have the largest
and bravest clan of the nation.
It is because of these situations
and to overcome difficulty
I have raised a huge clan.
The heroes of Magadh
are you ready to make
your king victorious?
Magadh's dignity is our pride!
We will die for Magadh!
Magadh's dignity is our pride!
We will die for Magadh!
As you can see,
Amatya, the clan is ready.
Very well!
Amatya
look it is my elder
brother Pandu and Kaivarta.
They should rather be looking happy.
But they look miserable instead.
What is the plan, Chandragupta?
I am perplexed, Acharya.
Dhananand was harsh
and brutal to our clan.
He maimed them.
Acharya, how will I plan ahead
in such a situation?
We have lost plenty of
our soldiers in the first battle.
Perhaps, we are not ready for war.
By now, Dhananand and his army must
have reached Seleucus and his army.
It seems, I overestimated our army.
In order to fight such a powerful man
we must stay patient
and train everyone.
We have lost soldiers, armour
and most importantly
we lost the opportunity
of taking them by surprise.
Our purpose is lost, Acharya.
The Kshatriya of Piplivan.
I need to say something
important to you.
Listen to me carefully.
Your prince Chandragupta feels
that you have lost the ability
to fight this war.
That the blood of a warrior
in your veins is burnt
in the fire that Dhananand started.
Your Prince was taken away
from you when he was little
and perhaps that is why he does not
know of the true might of Kshatriya.
Now it is your responsibility to show
your Prince that a true Kshatriya
is made up not just
of flesh but much more.
You must prove that a true Kshatriya
leaves a battlefield
a martyr or a winner
but not a quitter.
Acharya, this is not
the time for such a speech.
They all are injured,
not in a state of fighting.
No, my Prince.
We do not fear death
or stay attached to life.
Victory or death!
This is the principle of Piplivan!
Victory or death!
This is the principle of Piplivan!
Victory or death!
This is the principle of Piplivan!
Victory or death!
This is the principle of Piplivan!
Victory or death!
This is the principle of Piplivan!
Victory or death!
This is the principle of Piplivan!
Kshatriya of Piplivan..
Seeing this strength
and determination in you
I am assured again
that Dhananand can
only harm us physically
and not hurt our self-confidence.
So we shall fight.
We will fight till our last breath.
Yes, we will.
Victory or death!
This is the principle of Piplivan!
Victory or death!
This is the principle of Piplivan!
"Chandragupta Maurya!"
"Chandragupta Maurya!"
What? Chanakya was not with the army?
Yes, Your Majesty.
Only their Queen,
the handmaiden Mura was with them.
She was leading that army.
This means that Chanakya is alive.
Not just that,
even Chandra is alive with him.
And I am sure, they are
planning a retaliation, Amatya.
It is not wise to stay here anymore.
The journey that we anticipated would
take seven days must be completed
in three days now.
Yes, Your Majesty.
Soldiers!
Hurry!
Proceed!
'I remember my duties, Your Highness'
'but there are many others
who need me more now.'
'It is my duty to
protect them as well.'
'Pardon me. Stay safe and happy.'
Why are you walking
about in the palace?
And where is that guard of yours?
I do not know, Brother.
He disappeared all of a sudden.
He disappeared?
King Dhananand chose him
to be your guard to protect you
and you let him go?
Brother Kovi, he is not just my guard
but he has many duties
towards the King.
He is a trusted one of the King.
Trusted?
From the moment I laid eyes on him,
he seemed suspicious.
I will soon find out why
but first,
we must meet the sentry who fainted.
I am certain, he has answers
to our questions and doubts.
He might reveal things
about that lowborn for sure.
Prince Chandragupta
what is the strategy
to fight this huge army?
Dhananand used deception to attack us.
And we will do the same.
We will retaliate with deception.
He deceived me, Your Highness.
Deceived?
Who did this to you?
The guard of Princess Durdhara.
The slave Chandragupta.
See? Did I not tell you
that he seemed suspicious?
Chandragupta's friend, the cook..
Find him!
But, Brother, why would
Chandragupta attack our own men?
Chandragupta and his
friend were nervous when
they took your favourite carpet.
Moments later, I saw them in
the chamber where you were sleeping.
I was?
I never sleep during the day.
I was painting in my chamber.
What!
So who was in that chamber?
Pardon me, but we could
not find the cook Stulbhadra.
We have looked everywhere.
- It appears, he fled.
- Fled?
What is happening? Chandragupta
fled first and now his friend?
For how long have you known him?
Who is he? Where is he from?
What is his native land?
Do you know anything about him?
Chandragupta is merely a slave..
Not a slave!
He is the Prince of Piplivan.
What is the matter?
Why are you smiling?
Agnimukh..
I just realised that
if we change our perspective
our biggest weakness appears
as our greatest strength.
Challenges seem to
look like opportunities.
Dhananand's greatest
strength is his huge army
that will take very
long to reach the forest.
And that is when our little army
will spread like wildfire
and reach them before they do
and will be ready to attack
them before they are prepared.
And as I said,
we will retaliate with deception.
Acharya
our army is good at guerrilla warfare
especially in forests.
I am aware of the
strengths of this army.
And we will certainly
use it on Dhananand's army.
We will attack in a way
that he would have never
seen or even imagined.
To tackle it will be
very difficult for him.
What is your command?
The strategy must be
like that of the war.
Such that the enemy cannot even gauge.
We will now attack
the root and not the tree.
If we attack the root,
the tree stops growing.
We need to target not
the army by its resources.
Water, horses, food and medicines..
All of that must be destroyed.
One cannot even sing
on an empty stomach.
Then how will the
army of Magadh fight?
Come, my soldiers.
Let us show that when
the fingers come together
how powerful the fist becomes.
With the wood from this jungle
we will prepare a pyre
for the army of Magadh.
In order to climb a high mountain
this rope comes to great use.
It not only helps us reach the top
but it stops us from falling.
A guru and his apprentice
share a similar bond.
A guru not only guides the apprentice
but also helps him
in times of trouble.
But the one who discards this rope
upon reaching the
top is bound to fall.
And so, you must respect the guru
who helped you reach the top
because humiliating him or his absence
can drop you to the surface again.
My ethics..
Your destiny.
Slave? You?
Not slave. I am your death!
I am the Crown prince of Piplivan,
Chandragupta Maurya.

================================================================================

Episode: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pCCziwisQE

It is difficult to cross the
forests of Kaurihar in three days.
But my army has the
resources to cross it.
With the help of those resources
we will complete the treacherous
journey of a week in three days.
We have to achieve
this impossible deadline.
For that,
neither will we stop nor take rest.
We will keep moving continuously.
In three days, we will meet Seleucus
whose army is waiting for
us on the other side of the forest.
Magadh's honour is our pride!
- Magadh's honour!
- We will die for Magadh!
Magadh's honour is our pride!
We will die for Magadh!
- Magadh's honour is our pride!
- Let us move!
Be ready to carry out your orders.
'Before the army of Magadh
reaches the forests of Kaurihar'
'we would have taken up our posts.'
'As soon as they enter the forest'
'we will distract them
with uncontrolled cattle.'
'By the time the army
of Magadh clears the path'
'Chandragupta and our
army will steal their rations.'
'But do remember that you
do not have to steal everything.'
'This will make them
suspicious of our presence.'
'You have to steal
enough to make them suffer'
'without letting them know about it.'
Well done!
This is more than what our army needs.
This is just the beginning,
Chandragupta.
We have attacked their hunger.
Next attack will be on their thirst.
The water source that will
fall on their path is a pond, Acharya
It is about 50 kilometres from here.
The army of Magadh
will stop there to have food.
It means that we
do not have much time.
We have to reach there
before the army of Magadh.
Chandragupta
do not forget to take
this pot full of herbs.
It is very important for us.
We have to mix it to
the water of that pond.
It will result in the weakening
of the soldiers of Magadh.
Keep quiet!
Do not speak nonsense!
It is not right to tell
tall tales about anyone.
How can Chandragupta
be the prince of Piplivan?
He is a servant. A mere servant!
Did you get that?
And.. He cannot betray me, the king
and all of us like this. Never.
I understand your rage
irritation and broken trust, Princess.
I know that the truth
is bitter for you.
But believe me, this is the truth.
Think about it.
He had something
which was not the part
of a mere servant's behaviour.
Try to remember the
way he had defeated a lion.
He made the king change
his decisions multiple times.
He had saved Mura's life.
And the king had started to trust him
more than he trusted Amatya Rakshas.
'I think I know who has done this.'
'Your dear servant, Chandragupta.'
'Your Highness,
I agree with Commander Bhadrasaal.'
'I regret to see that
you are narrow-minded.'
'You always point fingers'
'at that servant for all
the miseries of this world.'
My mother..
Your foster mother..
You know her very well, do you not?
No one in Magadh can
doubt her loyalty to the king.
She has told me the same.
Tell me.. Who will you believe?
Will you believe Chandragupta
or my mother?
This is the truth, Princess.
Chandragupta has deceived us all
because the Prince of Piplivan
wants to exact revenge upon
Magadh for destroying his kingdom.
It is nothing more than that.
'I know my duties well, Princess.'
'But right now, there are many people'
'who need me more than you do.'
'It is my duty to protect them.'
No..
Durdhara! As far as I know you
you would never waste
your tears for a betrayer.
Instead, you have to punish him.
You are right, Brother Kovi.
Chandragupta will have to bear
the consequences of betrayal.
He will be punished for his deceit!
Those who drink the water contaminated
with this medicine will feel
sleepy and become unconscious.
Chandragupta!
That dagger from
Bundelkhand was left behind.
If the soldiers of Magadh
see it they will be alerted.
Our plan will fail.
Soon, Dhananand will
face great trouble.
Now, his army
will neither have food nor water.
You are the head of rationing
in this battle, are you not?
Then how did you
make such a big mistake?
The battle has not even started
and we are lacking rations.
Is this how you manage the rations?
My Lord, I have managed the rations
of Magadh army in many battles.
But this has never happened before.
If you are so experienced
then tell us the way
to remedy this problem.
Enough!
If you do not have food, make the army
survive on water!
I do not want to hear you
bicker on this small matter!
I just have to reach my goal!
That too, within the deadline!
Did you get that?
Yes, Your Highness.
'How can the rations
for the army be deficient?'
'Something seems fishy to me.'
'Was Chanakya not
with the Kshatriya army?'
'Yes, Your Highness. Only their queen
that servant, Mura, accompanied them.'
'She was leading their army.'
'If he was not there,
it means that Chanakya is alive.'
'Not only him,
but his future king is alive as well.'
'I have managed the rations
of Magadh army in many battles.'
'But this has never happened before.'
Why are we being served so less food?
How will a starving army
fight such a big battle?
Forgive me, comrades!
We do not have enough rations.
Please abate your
hunger with this food.
If you are still hungry you can
have the water to satiate yourself.
Stop!
No one will drink this water!
Your Highness, what happened?
I am sure that this
water is contaminated.
But our soldiers drink this water,
Your Highness.
No one has been harmed.
Everyone is fine.
Someone, call a physician!
You were right, Your Highness.
Someone had mixed the herb that
makes people unconscious in the water.
How is that possible?
This is the pure water
from the pond in the forest.
Amatya Rakshas
- we should talk privately.
- Yes, Your Highness.
The Magadh army will take
time to regain consciousness
and mobilise their troops.
We have to take
advantage of this time.
We have to cover a large distance.
At least, 10 kilometres.
We will use these trails through the
bushes and implement our next plan.
If a small thorn pricks you
it can make the entire
journey difficult.
Forgive me, Your Highness,
but I did not understand you.
Let me explain it to you.
Those Kshatriyas are still alive.
How is that possible, Brother?
Nothing is impossible, Brother.
Especially, when your enemy
is that cunning Brahmin, Chanakya.
Our rations did not
decrease but it was stolen.
He mixed the herb to
the pond in this forest
so that our army falls unconscious.
He cannot do this job alone.
Then we should disperse in the forest
and kill Chanakya and
those evil Kshatriyas.
I agree with him, Your Highness.
Brother, let alone killing them
you will not be able to catch them.
The Kshatriyas of Piplivan
are experts in guerrilla warfare.
We have to make a great plan.
So, what should we do, Your Highness?
Can you see this thorny bush, Brother?
Do you know why it
is called as 'Nagpushpa'?
Because it is so poisonous
that a single prick from
its thorn can kill anyone.
And it will become
the reason for the deaths
of Chanakya and those Kshatriyas.
Stop, Prince!
What happened? Is there a problem?
Look here.
How did this bush grow here?
It is found near a water source.
There is no water source here.
Then how did it grow here?
Why are you so
disturbed by this plant?
This is not a mere bush, Acharya.
This is the bush of 'Nagpushpa'.
A single prick from
it's thorn can kill a person.
If someone is pricked by it,
first the body starts to turn blue.
After a few days, when the entire
body turns blue that person dies.
Thank you, Baldev.
It is good that you told us.
Everyone, listen carefully!
The prick of the thorn of the bush
'Nagpushpa' can lead you
to a slow and painful death.
Walk carefully!
Prince Chandragupta your
safety is most important for us.
You will not lead the army. Come back.
As you say, Acharya.
Baldev and I will
go forward to make sure
that no one is pricked by this thorn.
Come, Baldev.
As soon as the soldiers gain
consciousness order them to mobilise!
Until then,
the rest of the army will not stop.
We have to reach our destination soon.
We do not need to find
those Kshatriyas in this forest.
Soon, they will die due to the pricks
pricks of the thorns of death.
Even the person who has
been askedto challenge me
by that foolish Brahmin,
Chanakya, will die.
Thank you, Prince.
Be careful, Matsaldev.
We have to be aware
of these 'Nagpushpa' bushes.
'If someone is pricked by it,
first the body starts to turn blue.'
'After a few days, when the entire
body turns blue that person dies.'
Dhananand must have realised
that we are in this forest.
He must have understood
that we will use this shortcut
to march ahead of his army.
He must also know that
this shortcut is littered
with the poisonous 'Nagpushpa' bushes.
Now, we have only one challenge.
We have to make Dhananand's plan fail.
We have to keep ourselves safe
and march ahead of Dhananand
so that we can stay
a step ahead of him.
'For the morale of my army,
I have to fight my enemy'
'and this poison as well.'
'Until the end of this battle'
'I have to hide this
wound from everyone.'
The burning of Holika
is a symbol of our culture
which states that good
always triumphs over evil.
But in this tradition
a secret is hidden.
Holika had the boon
of not burning in the fire.
Still, she was burnt to ashes
and Prahalad was saved.
The reason was that Prahalad's
faith and efforts were unfaltering.
It is not that in this world
the evil does not triumph.
It triumphs
but only over them
who falter in their duties.
Do remember that if
your intentions are true
efforts continuous
and faith unwavering
then even the greatest
fire will become
the reason for the end
of your enemy and not hurt you.
My ethics..
Your destiny.
Slave? You?
Not slave. I am your death!
I am the Crown prince of Piplivan,
Chandragupta Maurya.

Acharya, we will soon have to inform
the king of Assaka, Vajrabahu
that he should be
ready to attack Seleucus.
We will stop Dhananand in the forest
so that the king of Assaka can
defeat Seleucus and join hands with us
and we will get together
and defeat Dhananand.
Chandragupta, when I hear
your strategies I sometimes feel
that you do not need anybody
in this war of independence.
Not even my help.
I do not know about myself.
But the united India
definitely needs you.
We should reach the
Tripuna Mountain soon.
Now that Dhananand knows
that we are following him
he will definitely try to reach
Seleucus' army before us.
I know a shortcut.
The path is difficult.
But it will help us reach
Tripuna Mountain before Dhananand.
Let us go.
'For the confidence of my army'
'I will have to fight
not just against my enemies'
'but against this poison too.'
'I will have to hide this wound
from everyone till the war ends.'
Tripuna Mountain
is just one mile away.
Increase the security
of the king's chariot.
Mother, you proceed.
I will meet you at
the top of the mountain.
No, Chandra.
I will go with you.
Let us go.
Mother, you are not just my mother
but the queen of Piplivan too.
And to increase the
confidence of the army
it is not advisable
for you to be here.
You go forward. I will meet you soon.
As long as your mother is alive
she will not let
you slip from your goal.
Come up.
What happened, Chandra?
You do not seem to be okay.
Nothing, Mother. I..
- I..
- Oh, my God!
You have been hurt
by the poisonous plant.
We are close to reaching
our goal, Mother.
Chandra.
Our target is Dhananand.
He is in front of us.
Look at that.
Mother.
We are at that point in the war
which is important for India's future.
Recollect, Mother.
You had told me,
that if I attain martyrdom
will fighting a war on the
battlefield, you will not be sad.
- No. Chandra.
- You will feel proud
that I fought till my last breath.
Do you remember that, Mother?
If our army gets to
know that I am injured
they will lose their
self-confidence and strength.
And I..
I would never want
this to happen, Mother.
- No.
- Chandragupta.
The enemy's army is
standing in front of us.
It is time to attack. Get ready.
Okay, Acharya.
The enemy's army is coming towards us,
Chandragupta.
Dhananand is present
in the cabin on that chariot.
But we will have to destroy
the security around him to go to him.
We will meet soon, Dhananand.
Chandragupta, the moment
that you have been waiting for
from a very long time is
in front of you today.
Are you ready?
Go and face him
and change the history of India.
May the enemies be defeated.
May my India be great.
"May your enemies be defeated.
May your India be great."
Let us go.
Protect the king's chariot.
I hope Chandragupta's message
has reached Seleucus,
the king of Greece.
Chandragupta's message.
'Dhananand's army is
not coming to support you.'
'And Assaka's army can
attack you any moment.'
'Dhananand has made
this plan to get rid of you.'
'Assaka's army is very powerful.'
'You cannot defeat them.'
'Save your life and
go back to Takshashila.'
Your Highness,
Assaka's army has attacked us.
Chandragupta was right.
We will not be able
to fight Assaka's army.
We must go back to Takshashila.
That is good for us.
Not at all!
We will not give up.
We will fight them and prove Dhananand
that we do not need
him to win over Assaka.
Attack!
Acharya Chanakya was right.
The Greek will not give up so soon.
Soldiers, come on!
Attack!
Your Highness, it is too late now.
It is now impossible
to win this battle.
We will have to go back.
I am happy that this battle finished
before the time I had expected.
'The effect of this poison
is increasing but I cannot stop.'
Soon I will have to reach Dhananand.
I had enough chances
to kill you inside the palace.
But I want to see the
fear of death in your eyes.
Your death is calling you.
Come out, Dhananand. Come before me!
Brother Pandu, let us run away.
Or else, even we will be dead.
Dhananand!
Amatya, I want my special archers
to be deployed on the top of palace.
And I want impeccable
warriors around my chariot.
It will be the last day of that person
who has been chosen by Chanakya.
Let him come!
Assaka's army?
We have neither the king here,
nor do we have Amatya.
Dhananand has cheated us again.
Let us go!
Do not kill him.
He is the commander of Magadh's army.
He will be more beneficial
for us if he's alive.
Arrest him!
We can use him for a treaty.
Looks like you are the
partner of Acharya Chanakya.
The future king.
Come
let us embark towards
Magadh and do something.
Let us complete your revenge
and fulfill the resolve of Chanakya.
Let us defeat the enemy..
Let us form the united Bharat..
'I am ready to take your suggestion'
'and take my army towards
the west from north.'
Let us defeat the enemy..
Let us form the united Bharat..
What is Pandu and Kaivarta doing here?
Durdhara?
Chandra..
Take this medicine.
It will give you some strength.
'Come what may.'
'Dhananand,
I will make sure you face me today.'
Is Chandragupta the
prince of Piplivan?
Yes, Brother.
He has come to take revenge
from Brother Dhananand.
I must alert him before
Chandragupta attacks him.
But what are you both doing here?
You should have been
with him in the war.
Durdhara
you have a wrong
notion about Dhananand.
He cheated us some time back.
He left us to die in the battlefield
and went to the palace.
But this is good.
Now his trusted servant will kill him.
- What are you saying?
- He is telling you the truth!
That cheater deserves
nothing but betrayal.
I will neither alert Dhananand
nor will I let you go from here.
Don't you dare!
Even if I get a scratch
brother will not spare you.
Close the palace gates!
Princess Durdhara!
I need to meet the king urgently!
It is impossible to meet His Majesty.
He is busy with
preparations for battle.
Because the enemy is at our gates.
I do not care.
I need to meet the
king this very moment!
Pardon me, Princess.
Guards, escort the
princess to her chamber.
- Amatya, this is not fair.
- Hurry!
I must meet the king!
Warriors, take your positions.
This is our time!
March!
Soldiers!
Today, along with this main gate
even the gates of hell shall open
for the invaders of Piplivan.
- Magadh..
- Our life, our motherland!
- Magadh..
- Our life, our motherland!
- Magadh.
- Our life, our motherland!
Dhananand is fully
prepared for our arrival.
This fight won't be easy.
What is easy is not
a battle but a game.
And we aren't here to play games
but to unleash death!
March!
March ahead!
Brother!
So, you are the one
- whom Chanakya has chosen
- Yes.
And it is time now, that you know me
and even identify me.
Servant! It's you!
I am no servant, I am your doom.
The son of King Chandravardhan Maurya
and Queen Mura..
The prince of Piplivan..
Chandragupta Maurya!
Nature is but full of colours.
But when you look deeply
colours are a mixture
of two factors.
Let's take white for example.
When you add any colour to white
it blends with that colour
and results in a new shade.
Like this. On the other hand..
If you add any colour to black
it blots out the
existence of that colour.
This is the difference
between a good king and a tyrant.
A good king mingles with
his subjects like the colour white
and creates a new, bright future.
Whereas,
a tyrant, just like the colour black
of his subjects and kingdom
exploits all resources and wealth
and destroys their very existence
Hence, before following any ruler
it is imperative to know the difference
between a good king and a tyrant.
My ethics..
Your destiny.
Chandra!

Episode: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6rQ5Y69z1s

Slave, you!
I am not a slave but your death.
I am king Chandravardhan Maurya
and queen Mura's son.
Piplivan's prince..
Chandragupta Maurya!
Brother!
Durdhara, go inside.
'The revelation of my truth
has hurt you, Princess.'
'But when you find out
your brother's dark secret'
'you will know'
that what I am doing is right.'
'Seeing this head might
please you more than'
'beheading those heads.'
'I feel sorry for
your narrow-mindedness.'
'No matter what happens
you always blame that slave.'
'If you succeed in
bringing Chanakya here'
'then fine. Otherwise'
'I will definitely give you
the chance to prepare the pyre.'
'Hey!'
'I swear by this very plait'
'you have insulted'
'that I will destroy your
Nand dynasty utterly 'Dhananand!'
'I will dethrone you'
'and put a worthy
ruler on the throne.'
I was very eager to meet
that future king of united India
whom Chanakya had
sworn to put on my throne.
But whom did that lowly
priest choose?
My dear slave!
What else could be
expected from that fool?
He was always an idiot, but you..
I pity you, slave.
You are so gifted
then how did you get
tempted by his offer?
Or has his company
also deluded you that
you can defeat this great,
gigantic army of Magadh?
That you can sit on my throne?
Get out of this delusion, slave.
And if you want to save your life
bring me the head of the person
who conspired to destroy Magadh.
If you do that I will
forgive your betrayal
and spare your life.
Before I change my mind and kill you
bring me his head, slave!
One should rather give
a nod of respect to
those who give you blessings
not cut their head, Dhananand.
I am not deluded, you are!
That no one can take
away your throne from you.
But today,
I am here to shatter that delusion!
Excellent.
I gave this sword
to you instead of Amatya.
Because I found you more worthy of it.
Not just that,
ever since you came to the palace
I gave you gifts,
did you favour after favour.
I gave you the golden
moments of your life.
And this is how
you are repaying my favour!
By betraying me!
By bringing an enemy army
to my doorstep
you have proven that I made
you have proven that I made
a big mistake by trusting you
instead of my loyal servant of years.
People reap what they sow, Dhananand.
Remember what you did
to Paurav's king Puru.
You betrayed him.
'Puru got murdered
because of treasure.'
Remember what you did
to king Chandravardhan Maurya.
You betrayed him!
'I've brought a proposal
of friendship to you.'
'I hope the enmity
between us will end.'
'The venomous hatred
that you spat at me'
'yesterday in your court!'
'I have smeared the sword in it'
'and given it back to you!'
What did you do the people of Piplivan
and many more warrior
states like Piplivan?
You betrayed them. What did
you do to your brothers in the war?
You betrayed them!
But what I am doing
is not betrayal but revenge.
Take off the veil of arrogance
from your eyes and see
that standing in front
of you is not a slave
but the hope of India,
prince Chandragupta Maurya!
The prince of Piplivan
from whom you took everything.
My mother, my father,
my kingdom, my freedom
my right to live and respect..
Everything!
I am the son whose
father you cruelly killed.
Whose mother you made
your slave and humiliated.
I am the student
whose master you humiliated,
Dhananand.
'You are a mere grain of sand'
'who can touch my feet
'at the banks of a river'
'but if you interfere with my ways,
you will be washed away!'
All because he wanted
to give India a golden history.
It is you who betrayed our motherland!
The motherland which your greed
would not allow to attain freedom!
I will take revenge
for all your transgressions!
Revenge..
The chains of slavery
have been broken but
you are still bound by
the chains of foolishness, slave.
- Amatya.
- Yes, Your Majesty?
Where is Mura?
She saw her husband
die in front of her eyes.
I want her to have the honour
of seeing her son die too.
I will get no pleasure
in killing this slave
in Mura's absence.
Find her.
You do not have to look for me,
Dhananand.
I am right here.
This game of hide-and-seek
has gone on for too long.
Magadh will have a new sunrise now.
In this war of righteousness
my son will not only
have me by his side
but also his teacher
Acharya Chanakya, too.
I hope you are well, Dhananand.
Because it is a war between
righteousness and evil.
And today, you,
the representative of evil will lose.
And with Chandragupta's
victory in the war
my vow will be fulfilled.
Three of my greatest enemies
are standing in front me today.
Amatya
note this day in
the history of Magadh.
Magadh will celebrate
this day for eternity
because today I will end
my three enemies.
Attack..
- Attack!
- Attack!
Attack..
These are weapons of high grade,
right, Dhananand?
Too bad for you that your
soldiers do not have those
but the Kshatriyas of Piplivan do.
Only a fool like you would
consider himself powerful simply
because of buying high-grade weapons.
Your superior weapons made
with the iron of Bundelkhand..
Chandragupta stole them.
With those weapons,
he trained Kshatriyas of Piplivan.
It is rightly said..
A well crafted weapon feels good only
in the hands of a capable warrior.
Right, Dhananand?
Chanakya, those people are stupid
who think of deceiving someone
who is a notch above them
in deceitful ways.
No!
King of Assaka cannot betray us.
Before you
I had extended my offer of friendship
to King Vajrabahu of Assaka, Chanakya.
It was you who had challenged my ways.
Look at you now.
I am hundred times more
advanced than you in planning.
Neither will your oath be fulfilled
nor will your designated
king remain alive!
Kill everybody!
Victory or death!
This is the principle of Piplivan!
We will fight till our last breath!
Why did you betray us, King of Assaka?
We stopped the army of Dhananand
so that you could defeat
the army of Seleucus.
But you betrayed us!
That is your way of thinking, Acharya.
This is self defense
if you see it my way.
Dhananand has promised me,
that if I support him in this battle
then he will never enter
the kingdom of Assaka.
And you are forgetting
that I am a king
and my people are everything to me.
Unlike you, I cannot put my subjects'
lives at risk for my kingdom, Acharya!
Attack!
You are foolish, Vajrabahu!
'The treachery of
Assaka has isolated me.'
'Winning this battle
now is near to impossible.'
'The poison is taking
a toll on Chandragupta.'
'We have to retreat.'
Acharya, by any means,
I have to take him away.
Warriors of Piplivan.. Retreat!
No, Acharya!
I will not retreat.
Either we will gain
victory or become martyrs!
Come, slave!
Death awaits you!
Fire is such an element
that spreads light
and cuts through darkness.
When in an urn, it eradicates hunger.
But when it comes to destruction
it can destroy an entire jungle.
The only difference
is how to make use of fire.
This means,
a thing is not good or bad in itself.
It all depends
on the intentions of the user.
Whether that thing give
us a good or a bad result..
So, not only resources
but even the emotions
play an important part.
My ethics..
Your destiny.
Chandra!
It is time for your
last journey, slave!

================================================================================

Episode: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVp1QM9m-dQ

'The poison is taking
a toll on Chandragupta.'
'We have to retreat.'
'We are not at our best
due to Assaka's betrayal.'
'Now, we cannot win this battle.'
Warriors of Piplivan.. Retreat!
No, Acharya!
Now, I will not retreat!
We will either win or attain martyrdom!
Come, slave!
Death awaits you!
Acharya! He will not retreat.
We have to make him retreat at any cost.
My sword is unfortunate to see this day.
It has to shed
the blood of a mere slave.
No, Dhananand.
Now, the land of Magadh
will be stained with the blood
of a Napit Nand to quench its thirst.
Chandra!
Stop! No one will touch him.
It is time for your
last journey, slave!
Do convey my best regards
to your father, Chandravardhan.
Chandragupta!
Run!
You are destined to die today, midget!
Bring my horse!
Queen Mura
when you knew that Chandragupta
has been poisoned by 'Nagpushpa'
why did you not inform me?
Chandra did not want
our army to lose hope.
He did not want us to
be distracted from this battle.
That is why he stopped me from
telling this truth to anyone, Acharya.
My disciple is more stubborn than I am.
Your Highness! Acharya!
The army of Magadh
is quickly gaining on us.
All the exits of Magadh
have been closed, Acharya.
In that case,
we have only one option left.
We have to traverse through the river.
Turn the chariot towards the East.
Where did the Kshatriyas go?
My dear Kshatriyas!
Today, for our motherland
we have to sacrifice our lives.
No! This is suicidal.
You will not do this.
Forgive me, Your Highness.
It is impossible for
all of us to leave together.
So, a few of us will have to stay
here to stop the army of the enemy.
so that the rest of our army can
leave this place carefully and safely.
Agnimukh is right, Your Highness.
This is the need of the moment.
We have to make a sacrifice
for the freedom of our motherland.
Harden your heart and leave this place.
Your Highness, our prince, Chandragupta
freed us from the clutches
of Dhananand's slavery
and gave us the opportunity to die
as a martyr on the battlefield.
A respectable death
that Dhananand had denied us.
Today is the day when we pay
the debt that we owe to our prince.
We neither fear death nor love life!
Victory or death!
This is the principle of Piplivan!
Victory or death!
This is the principle of Piplivan!
Stop!
Get ready, my dear Kshatriyas!
Today, we have the
opportunity to exact revenge
upon Dhananand for the last 12 years!
Attack!
- Attack!
- Attack!
Amatya Rakshas
Chanakya has only one
route to escape from here.
Get our naval forces ready.
Before they reach the river
we have to find them.
Start rowing!
Agnimukh!
I should have killed you
the day I destroyed Piplivan.
Dhananand, I hope you remember
the things I told you on that day.
'Dhananand, soon the entire
Magadh will be against you.'
'One day, not only your kingdom'
'but the entire country
will be against you.'
Today is that day, Dhananand.
The countdown of your life has started.
If you want to save your life
then run from here!
Shall I run from here? Me?
He is running away from here.
Your prince, that midget!
I will not die.
He will die. And before him
you will die, Agnimukh!
You all Kshatriyas deserves this.
Slave!
Your Highness
our soldiers have
gone towards the river.
Soon that slave and Vishnugupta
Chanakya will be caught.
Today, they cannot escape from here
I will kill them.
Chandragupta!
Chandra! You cannot die, Chandragupta.
You have to return to kill
and destroy that evil Dhananand.
You cannot die!
Ready your shields!
The enemy is attacking us!
Bhadrasal, increase the number of boats.
The river should be filled
with the naval forces of Magadh!
Yes, Your Highness.
Hurry up!
Deceit!
Those Kshatriyas have
sabotaged our boats.
Do not think that your plan can save you
and your deceitful disciple from me!
Bhadrasaal!
Be it through land or water..
Block all the paths.
Use all our resources!
Do whatever you want
but I want that
Chandragupta at any cost.
Yes, Your Highness.
Turn the boat towards the shore!
'Dhananand,
etch this day in your memories.'
'Because you will remember this day'
'when I turn you from
a king to a pauper.'
'The plait that you insulted today..'
'I swear by it'
'that I will destroy the Nand Dynasty,
Dhananand!'
'I will dethrone you'
'and crown a capable ruler.'
'Slave? You!'
'I am not a slave, but your death!'
'I am King Chandravardhan Maurya'
'and Queen Mura's son.'
'Prince of Piplivan..'
'Chandragupta Maurya!'
Chandragupta Maurya!
Chanakya has chosen that brat
from Piplivan to complete his oath.
He has chosen him
to snatch my throne!
Rest assured, Your Highness.
Chandragupta cannot
escape from our clutches.
We will find him soon.
Chandra..
Amatya Rakshas, even I know
that Chandragupta cannot escape from us
and soon he will be my prisoner
but I am worried that
the reason for his death
may be something else.
Forgive me, Your Highness.
I did not understand you.
The 'Nagpushpa'.
Amatya Rakshas, Chandragupta has
been poisoned by that poisonous bush.
I saw that myself.
He does not have much time left.
Perhaps, he has
only a few hours left to live.
Chandra..
Chandra..
After a lamp is extinguished
it becomes useless.
This is our thinking.
But it is not the fault
of the extinguished lamp.
It is the fault of our point of view.
Even after being extinguished
the lamp leaves soot behind
that can be used as kohl.
The kohl may not emit light
but it soothes our eyes
that can see in the light
and keeps them healthy.
In the same way the defeats
that we observe in life
are never a complete defeat.
Because it leaves behind the lessons
that can help you gain victory again.
That is why do not lose
hope on being defeated.
Change your perspective.
Do not see the extinguishing lamp
but the rising kohl.
My ethics..
Your destiny.
Mura and Chanakya will
not let Chandragupta die
and I will not let him live.
You cannot die.
You shoulder the future
of entire India, Chandra.
You have to stay alive.

================================================================================

Episode: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=22uvnYgZvnw

Chandragupta just
has a few more hours.
We have to hurry up.
Boatman, row faster!
Your Highness
only the 'Jiv Gandh' herb
can save Chandragupta.
Because it is the only herb
that can cure the
effects of 'Nagpushpa'.
It grows on Mount Ramba of Magadh.
Healer Ishwar Prasad's hut is situated
on the summit of that mountain.
He is the only one who
can save Chandragupta's life.
But for that, we have to
take him there before sunset.
If Chandragupta is not
treated with the 'Jiv Gandh' herb
it would be impossible
for him to stay alive.
No..
No, Chandra.
Chandra, you cannot die.
You shoulder the future
of entire India, Chandra.
You have to stay alive.
I will protect the
saviour of my motherland.
I will protect you!
I.. I will not let
anything happen to you.
Acharya,
how far is Mount Ramba from here?
Fifty 'Kos'. Right, Amatya Rakshas?
Yes, Your Highness.
Mount Ramba is situated
50 'Kos' away from here.
But why did you ask that?
Because the cure for
the poison of 'Nagpushpa'
the 'Jiv Gandh' herb grows there.
Mura and Chanakya will
not let Chandragupta die
and I will not let him live.
We have to see who wins this game.
Who is left to be defeated,
King Dhananand?
Our treaty has defeated
two of your enemies at once.
Seleucus must be preparing
to return to Takshshila.
As far as Chandragupta is concerned
your able naval forces
will find him and kill him.
Did I say anything wrong,
King Dhananand?
No..
King of Assaka,
Vajrabahu you were not wrong.
Today, we will have our food together.
As a show of gratitude for your help
I even have a special gift for you.
But, Your Highness
it is important for us to go towards
Mount Ramba and kill Chandragupta.
Amatya Rakshas
being hospitable to
your friends is as important
as being hostile to your enemies.
Moreover, I will not take much time
in honouring my friend.
Boatman, take the boat towards north.
The Mount Ramba lies there..
Acharya, be careful..
Attack!
Acharya! How will we escape from here?
Dhananand's army has
cornered us from both sides.
King of Assaka I have heard of
your love for the mangoes of Magadh.
That is why I got the
'Aamras' made especially
for you from the famous
mangoes of Magadh.
Have it..
It looks so delicious.
Why do I not have it all?
Why not? Enjoy it.
Did you think
that I, King Dhananand
of Magadh would form a treaty
with an insignificant man like you?
Being a Kshatriya you betrayed
another Kshatriya, Chandragupta.
You can betray Magadh
using our forces.
You wanted to name the mangoes
of Magadh as Assaka's, did you not?
That is why I chose this
as the means of your death.
Now, not only the district
of Assaka will be under Magadh's rule
but all the districts
will come to know
that whoever tries
to Magadh and its property
bears severe consequences.
I have completed a task now
I have to solve my second problem.
These efforts are not enough,
Stulbhadra.
We have to stop them completely.
Otherwise,
they will keep trying to stop us.
What are you doing, Acharya?
Baldev, their large boats
can move in deep waters
but not where the water level is low.
I am trying to find where
the water level is low.
Our smaller boats can
easily pass through there
but their large boats
will be stuck to the riverbed.
Yes! The water level is low here.
The larger boats of
Magadh cannot reach here.
Row in this direction!
Follow them!
Acharya, your plan succeeded!
Their boats are stuck there!
But as long as we are
traversing through the river
they will keep following us.
We have to abandon the path through
the river and take to the road.
But we do not have much time, Acharya.
Before sunset, we have to give
Chandra the 'Jiv Gandh' herb.
I know, Your Highness.
That is why we have to
divide our troop into two.
Take Chandragupta to Mount Ramba.
I will stop them here
with Baldev and other soldiers.
But, Acharya,
I do not know the way to Mount Ramba.
Your Highness, follow my instructions.
You will reach the place
that goes towards Mount Ramba.
You will have to find
the path from there.
Follow the flow of the river.
Soon, you will reach a small corner.
There you will find a
bush covered with red flowers.
Disembark there.
Nearby that place, you will
find a trail filled with thorns!
Take that trail.
It goes to Mount Ramba.
Healer Ishwar Prasad lives
on the summit of Mount Ramba.
Only he can save Chandragupta.
Do not worry, Your Highness.
If a mother resolves to save her child
even the God of death
cannot part her from her child.
Do not lose hope.
You are right, Acharya.
To save my son,
Chandra I will do anything.
'Follow the flow of the river.'
'Soon, you will reach a small corner.'
'There you will find a bush
covered with red flowers.'
'Disembark there.'
Red flowers.
"You are my shadow."
"You are my life."
"I will not let you be harmed"
"as long as I am alive."
"Your mother will go through"
"all the trials"
"to protect you."
- "You are my son."
- Chandra!
Chandra!
"Oh, the flow of the river,
take me to the shore."
"Do not take away
the support of my life."
"There is nobody else in my life."
"Be it an apocalypse"
"or even if time halts"
"I will fight fate"
"to save your life."
"Be it any storm.."
Chandra..
Chandra, I will not let you die.
No harm will befall you,
but you must stay with me.
Stay with me.
"You are my blood."
"You are my shadow."
"You are my life."
"I will never let you die"
"while I am alive."
Chandra..
Chandra!
The sun is about to set. I must hurry.
Attack!
Attack!
Soldier, give me the sword..
Chanakya, no matter how
much you try to save Chandragupta
he will not survive.
King Dhananand has started
for Rambha Mountains.
Stop!
We must go to Rambha
Mountains right away.
We need to save Lady
Mura and Chandragupta.
Let us go!
Before sunset
I will kill you and not that poison,
Chandragupta.
I have lost you once, Chandra.
No matter what happens
your mother will not let you die.
Between you and your death
your mother will stand as your shield.
No shield in the world
can save you from me.
Physician! Lord Ishwaram..
Physician!
Lord Ishwaram!
Save my son.
But who are you, Lady?
I.. I am just a mother. A mother!
Chandra..
Open your eyes. Wake up, Chandra.
He was poisoned.
He has stopped breathing.
You.. Chandra.
I have heard you have
an antidote for such poison.
Physician, please save my son.
Chandra, open your eyes..
Chandra.. Please open your eyes.
It appears, you were too late.
The herbs are not working on him.
No.. No! No, Chandra. No!
You cannot die.
You must wake up,
not just for your mother
but for Acharya Chanakya
and for the whole country.
You must come back. Return to me.
You cannot give up. You cannot!
Chandragupta!
Chandra..
Chandra..
It is true..
If a mother wishes,
she can even resurrect her dead child.
He will recover soon.
I will need the soil
from the riverbank
to make a paste for his healing.
I will bring it.
You will be fine now, child.
Do you see this leaf?
When the bud grows
it becomes soft and green.
During spring,
it grows further with the tree.
But when scorching
sunlight falls on it
it starts to change colour.
And during autumn,
it falls from the tree.
But the tree does not wither because
it grows with the help of its roots,
not its leaves.
Similarly,
in life, you must stay cautious
of those who change their colours
according to circumstances.
And you must have absolute
faith in yourself first.
My ethics..
Your destiny.
The task that was left incomplete
years ago will be completed today.
Attack me..

================================================================================

Episode: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBh9omJwIJQ

You proclaimed yourself
to be my death.
Now, wait and watch
how I, Dhananand,
kill you mercilessly.
Attack me, Dhananand!
Today, not a slave or queen
but a mother is
standing infront of you
like a shield of his son. Attack me.
Even after being enslaved for years
you have not forgotten
the art of sword fighting
Queen Mura.
The humiliation that I faced
has made me stronger, Dhananand.
The fire of revenge has
sharpened my resolve.
Did I not tell you
I would destroy the Maurya Dynasty
and kill all their descendants?
The task that was
left incomplete years ago
will be completed today.
First, I will kill you
and when you are breathing your last
you will see your son being killed
helplessly.
Acharya, look there!
Look there.
Amatya Rakshas is going
towards the hut with his army.
They outnumber us.
We have to stop them with brains,
not brawn.
Attack!
Chandra! No, Chandra!
Chandra!
Baldev!
Come.
- Chandra.. - Your Highness,
take him away from here.
- I will stay here with Baldev
and other soldiers. - Yes..
But, Acharya, try to understand me..
Chandra, keep quiet!
Do not argue with me.
During a battle, there comes a time
when you have to step
back to defeat the enemy.
If you want to regain your
strength and attack Dhananand
then retreating from here
is the only option you have.
Go from here!
Your Highness, take him away.
It seems that after our last meeting
you have practised sword
fighting a lot, Amatya Rakshas.
Vishnugupta!
But no matter how much expertise
you gain in the art of warfare,
Amatya Rakshas
our attacks cannot defeat me.
Your every attack is inspired
by your loyalty towards
the unrighteous Dhananand.
My every attack is inspired
by my love and loyalty
towards my motherland!
Baldev!
Dhananand,
as you sow, so shall you reap.
Get ready to bear the
consequences of your deeds.
We will meet again.
Leave.
Come on!
Your Highness,
we do not have much time.
We should go back through the river.
- Acharya.
- Yes?
We cannot go downwards.
A lot of soldiers are
coming towards us from there.
Even Amatya Rakshas has
freed himself from the net.
If we cannot use the
route through the river
then we have only one option left.
The summit of the mountain.
Chandragupta
it is difficult to scale the mountain.
Will you be able to do it?
Let us go!
Chandragupta!
Are you all right?
Come on.
What happened?
Where is A-Agnimukh, Acharya?
You should not lose focus now.
We will talk about this later.
Come on.
Hiding the truth cannot change it.
Where is Agnimukh? Tell me!
He sacrificed himself
in this battle for freedom.
He accepted martyrdom
to allow us to escape safely.
Look there, Amatya Rakshas!
They are going towards
the summit of the mountain.
They are foolish! They do not know
that trouble is awaiting them.
Let them go towards their death.
No.
We will not give those Kshatriyas
any opportunity to escape.
- Climb the mountain!
- Hurry up!
Chandragupta, all of us
will have to jump from here.
What are you saying, Acharya?
Look at the speed of the
river and the mountains there.
Jumping from here is
equivalent to inviting death.
Indra, if you jump from here
there is a possibility of surviving.
You may even remain alive.
But if you wait at
the top of this mountain
you will definitely die.
And this is not an ordinary river.
This is Goddess Ganga who
has given life to many people.
While jumping into it imagine that a
child is jumping on the mother's lap.
I am sure
that Goddess will definitely
protect her children.
Acharya is absolutely right.
Goddess Ganga will protect us now.
Jump!
All of them would have
jumped from here and died.
Go and bring their bodies.
Hurry up!
Start shooting arrows.
Kill them in the water.
'I will make you leave this throne'
'and make a capable ruler sit here.'
Sorry, Brother.
Forgive us, Brother.
We could not understand
the strategy of your war
and assumed that you are
not concerned about our lives.
Yes, Brother.
We have committed a crime
and not an ordinary mistake.
Along with suspecting
your war strategy
we tried to stop Sister Durdhara too
so that you do not get to know
that servant's truth through Durdhara.
'I will have to warn brother
before he attacks him.'
'Neither will we warn Dhananand
nor will we let you go from here.'
Brother, forgive us for
both the crimes and grant us life.
How did both of you assume
that I want to kill both of you?
After what both of
you have done it is clear
that the same blood
flows in our veins.
I used both of you
and ensured my victory in the war.
And whatever both of you did
was to seek revenge for my bad deed.
Our scores have been settled now.
I know
that both of you might be thinking
that there must be some intention
of mine behind forgiving you.
But that is not true.
Considering the circumstances
I want all of us brothers to be united
and transform ourselves
into an impeccable power.
And that is possible
only when you forget
these trivial issues
and try to sense
the danger which I can.
We should be ready
to face a very big danger.
- Mother..
- Chandra..
I am fine.
I am warrior.
Such wounds are my rewards.
What about this?
Even this is a normal wound, right?
Chandragupta
I know that you must be very worried
to see the wounds of your mother.
But in this situation,
we cannot just sit.
We must keep walking.
There is no other
way to save ourselves.
Okay.
But what is the guarantee
that we will not be
chased even in the woods?
That they will not try to attack us?
Attack and defence
is the nature of war.
But most importantly we
should not give up in a battle.
Negative thinking during a war makes
us weak and strengthens the enemy.
All right, Acharya.
I will not think negative.
Come, brothers!
Let us proceed with a positive mind.
I, your prince, Chandragupta Maurya
will take the path of greatness!
Come on! March forward!
Queen, Chandragupta must understand
that more than him it is the ego
of Dhananand which has got hurt.
He will surely take revenge.
This small plant will
grow up to be massive tree.
But no matter how big
a tree is the water is given
to its trees for its strengthening.
Because it is the roots
which grow the long
branches and leaves.
It also goes deep
to keep up its existence.
Hence, everyone should remember
that the more one believes in himself
and the more constant his perseverance
is the more he will succeed.
My ethics..
Your destiny.
By any means, get me Chandragupta..
Put our vicious dogs behind them.
Those are dogs barking.
Those are not ordinary dogs
but special dogs
of the army of Magadh.

================================================================================

Episode: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtvefjuaS2M

Mahamatya! My throne is shaking!
Your Highness!
This was the biggest problem.
A small object got
dislodged from my throne
and it created a trembling experience
which shook the throne of this empire!
The same way
there are two problematic
persons in Magadh
which poses a threat to this throne.
They are trying to shake
the balance of this throne.
One is that pathetic monk Chanakya
and the second is
his prodigy Chandragupta.
No need to worry, Your Highness.
As per your orders
all the informers in all the
fifteen districts have been informed
that from now on and
from this very moment
they will have only one goal..
To find Chandragupta and Chanakya.
And nothing more than that!
Along with that the destruction
which are army had to suffer..
We have recruited new soldiers.
Very soon with more might and power
the army of Magadh will be ready,
Your Highness.
No.
Only secret informers
and army will not do.
I want every resource
and people of Magadh
should be alerted.
Put our vicious dogs behind them.
Unleash hungry and
dreadful lions on them..
The land, jungles, rivers, mountains
and caves of Magadh..
Search all these places. But..
By any means, get me Chandragupta..
Use any form of power
to get him!
Brother,
to nab Chanakya and Chandragupta
Brother Pandup and I have
a divine weapon.
I promise you that
the weapon will not fail.
'This is the shield and
sword of the king of Piplivan.'
'He raised his voice
in front of King Dhananand.'
'There are times when one
has to retreat to defeat the enemy.'
'If you want to restore
your energy and attack Dhananand'
'then the only option
now is the retreat.'
'Where is Agnimukh, Acharya?'
'In a bid to gain freedom
the brave man became a martyr.'
'To make sure that we
come out of the palace safely'
'he sacrificed his
life while fighting.'
Those are dogs barking.
What are they doing in these jungles?
Those are not ordinary dogs
but special dogs
of the army of Magadh.
They tend to sniff the
blood of their enemy miles away.
Dhananand has unleashed them.
This means, the soldiers
of Magadh are still after us.
I will divert the attention
of these killer dogs!
Chandra!
Stop, Chandra! Danger lurks there!
- Chandra!
- Chandra!
Everybody give me your
blood-soaked clothes.
Hurry up!
Acharya, what are you trying to do?
The trick which Dhananand
used by unleashing the dogs..
I am going to thwart his move.
And I am also going to give some lesson
to our prince the grave mistake he did.
Come on! Show up!
Come after me!
At least give me a chance to win!
Do not take my life so lightly!
Give me a chance to protect my army!
Come forward!
What you were going
to do was not a brave
but an ignorant act!
Did you ever give it a thought
if those dogs would have attacked you.
They wouldn't have just ripped you into
pieces of flesh but along with that
they would have ripped apart even us
and the dream of united Bharat.
So, in future if you
feel the urge to demonstrate
any such acts of bravery,
think about all of us, also think
about our aim of freedom,
about the united Bharat
think about the future
generations and also
think about your mother.
The one who went beyond her limits of
strength and stamina to save your life
and give you a second life.
When a person is the
hope of all the people
then his position is elevated
and if a person of that stature
does this kind of act of bravery
he will be termed as a fool.
A person of your stature can't do this
kind of a foolish act, Chandragupta.
It's all right, Chandragupta.
Today we faced deceit and defeat
but definitely the future
will be bright for us.
By the way, time never stops
even this will pass off.
Those dogs will return soon.
We have to get to a
safer place immediately.
If Dhananand has power
we have will power
and we won't allow Dhananand
to win at any cost.
Durdhara!
I am responsible for all this.
That day when you found
him guilty in Grandma's case
I was the one who
proved he is innocent.
'Yes, Brother, he was with
me when the accident occurred.'
'He was helping me complete my poem.'
'Both of us heard the
siren simultaneously.'
'We ran together towards
the place where Grandma had fallen.'
Had I not done that,
you wouldn't have been hurt today.
Your condition wouldn't
have been like this.
- Please forgive me.
- No.
Get up.
I am not able to understand
what are you hinting at.
Is it about my wounds?
Look at me.
The servant, that small
person hasn't able to put me
into trouble in any form, Durdhara.
Instead, I am more
powerful than before.
Yes, I did lose a few soldiers
but this incident is a petty
one among the other incidences.
From today, the only other
powerful kingdom apart from Magadh
Assaka is under my control.
Our army is motivated
and my brothers are with me again.
The most important thing
is that my dear, sister is with me.
You are attending to
my wounds and cleaning them.
As far as it goes about trusting
Chandragupta, even I am at fault
but he will pay for his betrayal,
today itself.
We are talking about him
but he would've been captured by
our army in some part of the kingdom.
Have you become senseless?
Answer me.
These are just dogs,
they can trace by smelling the enemy
but they can't figure
out the enemy's plans.
But you are humans, so you
could've used your intellegence.
If these are here,
then think and try to figure out
that this is definitely a plan
by the clever Chanakya
to mislead us.
If all this are here
then they would have
definitely ventured
into the opposite direction
where there are a lot of caves.
It is about to get dark.
It will be very difficult
to trace them at night.
Hurry up.
Your wound is very deep, Yudhveer.
It seems that we should stay
put in this cave for a few days.
So that your wound can heal
and the remaining soldiers can rest
and feel refreshed and healthy.
Yes!
Chankaya is right.
We have to rest here
for a couple of days
and regain our mental
and physical health.
Where is Stulbhadra?
I hope he is not busy eating
instead of arranging food for us.
I imagine of fresh and tasty
roti but I get these vegies.
I don't know when will I get
to eat tasty and healthy food.
When will I get to
eat to my heart's content.
Amatya!
Acharya..
Chandra..
Outside..
What is outside?
They are here..
Amatya.. He is coming here.
Where did you see him?
They are near the opening of the cave.
We have to leave
this place immediately.
If we leave this cave
Amatya and his soldiers
will not let us live.
What do you suggest, Acharya?
Remove that stone.
Quickly!
There is a path. Follow me.
I am sure they are near.
I do not think they have gone too far.
We have to keep on searching for them.
I want Chandragupta
and Chanakya at all costs!
Oh, God!
Save us. I will reduce my weight.
I will focus more on food..
No, I focus less on food
and more on exercising.
Just save us this once..
Come!
We were saved by hair's breadth.
My food..
Birds moving at night?
They have surely detected a danger.
It means that they were there,
in the trees!
Come quickly!
The situation has
become as it was before.
We have to find a safe location.
I know such a place.
Come on!
Deceit.
He deceived us.
He will be punished for it.
You will never catch them.
So that was his path.
He sacrificed his life and saved us.
If we do not escape
Yudhvir's sacrifice will go to waste.
That Vishnugupta first
deceived us with tricks.
and he has trapped us now!
Once again
he escaped from us!
Sometimes, to win wars
you have to take two steps back
before taking a step forward.
Look at this water. It seems calm
and stable.
But..
even a small rock
has potential to disturb
the peace and stability of water.
Just like that,
decisions taken in life
under rage can disturb the
peace and stability of your life.
So no matter how difficult
situation becomes
always keep your calm
and make every decision after
intense deliberation.
Only then will you be able to maintain
peace and stability in your life.
My ethics..
Your destiny.
Dahak and his sister, Nishumbha.
They belong to the family
of world-renowned assassins.
Nishumbha senses the presence of her
enemies immediately and finds them.
Dahak has always attained his goals,
Your Highness.
We will think of your goal as our own.

================================================================================

Episode: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6z-BE69j94

- Wake up, warrior!
- Wake up, warriors..
- Wake up, warriors..
- Wake up..
- Wake up, warriors.. Wake up..
- Baldev..
Wake up..
Acharya, now we will keep the watch.
Take some rest.
- That is a good suggestion.
- No.
It will not be good for us
to stay at a place for a long time.
If we want to stay away from Dhananand
then it is important
for us to keep moving
continuously,
without stopping or getting tired.
By now, Amatya Rakshas
would have told Dhananand
that we have escaped his clutches.
So, Dhananand's next attack
will be fatal and dangerous.
Be ready.
Let us go.
'In this way that one Kshatriya'
'trapped us in his suicidal trap.'
'It helped Chandragupta,
Chanakya and Mura'
'to escape from our
clutches once again.'
'Amatya Rakshas begs or
your forgiveness, Your Highness.'
What is it, Brother?
I observed silence for a few moments
for that loyal Kshatriya
who sacrificed his
life for his master.
I want.. I want such people.
This is the reason
that despite being fewer in numbers
those Kshatriyas are stronger than us.
They have such warriors
who are not only experts in warfare
but are so loyal towards their goal
that they sacrifice their lives
for attaining their
goal without any qualms.
They are willing
to sacrifice themselves
for invigorating
the flames of rebellion.
I want such people
so that I emerge victorious
not them.
I have brought such experts for you,
Your Highness.
Dahak and his sister, Nishumbha.
They belong to the family
of world-renowned assassins.
With her hard work and patience
Nishumbha has developed
all her six senses so much
that she senses the presence of
her enemies mmediately and finds them.
Once Nishumbha reaches her
adversary, her brother, Dahak..
No one can escape his attacks.
Dahak has always attained his goals,
Your Highness.
I know that the two
of you are continuously
trying to prove your
loyalty towards me.
But for that, why are you
presenting them as sacrificial lambs?
Do you know who is the least
experienced guard of this palace?
Tell me.
He is the protector of
Princess Durdhara's friend
Shipra's flowers.
He can defeat them
and you have brought them to me
so that I can utterly destroy them.
Do you really think
that the two of them can
catch the biggest enemy of Magadh
that is the cunning and evil Chanakya?
He has escaped from
our clutches not once
but multiple times.
Go and leave them from
whence you brought them.
Perhaps, your eagerness
to prove your loyalty towards me
has addled your brains.
Go!
How dare you! Light the torches!
Did you do this?
There are so many torches here and you
extinguished all of them in one blow.
How did you do this?
This is my trusty weapon,
Your Highness.
It reaches its target
and comes back to me.
I do not like to leave
any evidence behind.
Amazing!
Great! Marvellous!
My sword? My..
How did you get my sword?
There is at least a distance
of 25 steps between us.
In pitch darkness
when people struggle to see
their immediate surroundings
you took my sword from me
and I did not even realise it.
Not only that,
but you went back to your place.
How did you do this?
We are here to serve you,
Your Highness.
We ensure you
that we will think
of your goal as our own.
If we fail to attain it you will
not see us alive after this.
Brother
take them away from here
but to my personal
and special treasury.
Along with money, it contains great
dangerous and lethal weapons.
Arm them with whatever they want.
Acharya, hiding is not the solution.
For how long will we keep
hiding in one place or the other?
Why do we not go away
from Magadh for a few days?
No!
Leaving Magadha is not an option!
If we do that
it will be deemed insulting
to our dream of rebellion
and the sacrifice of
the hundreds of Kshatriyas.
If we run from here
then Dhananand will think
that there is no warrior
who can dethrone him.
But it does not mean
that all of you are
bound to go ahead with us.
It is your life.
So, you have to decide
if you want to move ahead or not.
No one will judge you
on the basis of your decision.
Instead, we will express our gratitude
for the way you have fought with us
against Dhananand until now
and for showcasing your
great courage and valour.
So, those who do not
want to go ahead with us
please take a step back.
I want to reassure you
that your decision will
not be counted against you.
Your decision will be respected.
All of us will move ahead with you!
What should be our next step, Acharya?
We must divide our
army into five troops.
Such a huge army marching together
can put us in trouble.
We will become noticeable
and they might catch us.
So it will be wise
to change our guise
whenever we get the chance.
You may take the guise of a merchant,
labourer, blacksmith
hunter or barber.
We will need a new guise for safety.
But keep in mind that
while staying in Magadh
we must not be noticed by the King.
Just as milk and water,
when blended, look the same
similarly we must blend
in with the people of Magadh.
This will be our strategy.
What strategy? I do not follow.
Besides, how is this strategy
related to Chanakya or Chandra?
Of course, it is related.
Do you see something
strange or abnormal here?
No, Your Majesty.
I just see too many
potatoes here nothing else.
A rock.
But, Your Majesty
this looked just
like the other potatoes.
This is what I was
trying to explain, Amatya.
When one is blended with the others
it appears similar to the others.
This is what that lowborn
and his guru Chanakya have been doing
and will continue to do so.
Chandragupta can use his words
to lure anyone. Try to recollect..
When we were looking
for Mura's son across Magadh
that cunning Chanakya got him
to stay in my own palace,
in front of me
and we could have never imagined that.
The last time I saw Chandragupta
he showed me his sword
which means,
he is still filled with revenge
despite being defeated once.
He will stay here.
It was never his plan to leave Magadh
and it will never be.
He will gather his people
and try to attack again
for which,
he will stay here, at a safe place.
We must only look for the place
where Chandragupta and
his entire army will be hiding
guised as the people of Magadh.
Guised as the people of Magadh,
we can make our army stronger.
For that, we must immediately
choose a territory out of
the ten greatest ones in Magadh
where we can hide safely
and plan our next move.
Hide, everyone!
Get up!
Why did you kill him?
You are a soldier
and it is your duty to protect us.
Do not teach us our job, traveller.
What was our fault?
Your fault is that
you four were together.
A new law has been enforced
in Magadh which forbids
more than two people
to stand together.
But why?
Our great king
Lord Dhananand did this.
'Across Magadh, if more than
two people are seen gathered'
'you must kill them without question.'
'Even if they are gathered
for a wedding or funeral'
'with family or friends'
'no mercy must be granted.'
'Those people will be considered
traitors and will be punished'
'because people always
rebel in groups.'
'That group of few people
will not take long to expand'
'and try to bring about revolution.'
'And hence,
do not allow them to make a group.'
Do not blame us.
All this is happening because
of the traitor Chandragupta
and that Brahmin Chanakya.
Our King is compelled
to do all this because of them.
Go home and celebrate
for your spared life.
Innocent people are
killed only because
they stood in groups of more than two.
He has crossed all limits,
Chandragupta.
Scatter, everyone, and try to get
as much information as possible
so that we can immediately decide
which territory we must
choose to live in, in Magadh
where we can plan our
next step towards revolution.
Go!
You revived just two days ago.
You are prohibited
from eating solid foods.
Besides, my food has
been tested for me already.
Rest assured.
I cannot take a risk.
Especially when it
comes to your safety.
Under my watch
that Stul got to work
in the royal kitchen.
The very thought scares me
that he had so many chances
to poison your food.
All this happened under my watch.
No..
- Y-You should eat..
- Well..
He had not just breached
our royal security
but even our predictions.
We made a mistake
and he took advantage of that.
I was his only target
but you, Durdhara,
Shipra and everyone else
was somehow affected by him.
But do not worry.
I will punish him in a way
which is yet unseen
and even unimaginable.
He will set an example
to show the people what happens
when someone betrays Magadh.
You are right.
But this not the time
to think about him. Please eat.
It has been so long since I fed you.
'If you allow'
'may I get some time out?'
'When I heard of Piplivan
and it's destruction'
'of how you destroyed
all the paths leading to it'
'I got curious'
'and so I decided to check
the security there.'
'I have three best friends'
'who are not just friends,
but they are like family.'
'I request you to allow
them to work here as I do'
'and I will be ever so grateful.'
What is the matter?
They will do what they
did in the royal palace.
They will take up new guises
and choose a new territory
and blend in. They will not hold back.
They will come up with a new plan
which will again lead to betrayal.
'But this time,
I will give such a fitting reply'
'to Chandragupta and Chanakya
that the world will see.'
Salt and sugar.
They look similar.
They are easily dissolved in water.
But..
They have different qualities.
Salt, when dissolved in water
turns the water distasteful.
And sugar makes the water sweet
when dissolved.
Similarly, in life,
we meet many people and blend in.
Some make our lives
distasteful like salty water
while some others make our
lives so much sweeter, like sugar.
So, you must not consider
the appearance of the person
but rather, their qualities.
My ethics..
Your destiny.
Circulate this notice to all the
regions of the kingdom immediately.
Just let me know
where do I start with.
Paraspura!
Dhananand has complete confidence
on Paraspura's ruler, Jagat Jala.
It means that Paraspura is
the ideal place for us to seek refuge.

================================================================================

Episode: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V6cBLAd6yA4

[Sanskrit shlok]
Dhananand's huge army
has arrived in Vishnupura.
The ruler is weak as well.
So, it might not be easy
for us to enter that region.
[Sanskrit shlok]
Except Paraspura it's the
same in all the other kingdoms.
[Sanskrit shlok]
Dhananand has complete confidence
on Paraspura's ruler, Jagatjala.
Jagatjala provides the
remedy to Dhananand whenever
some problem arises.
Jagatjala is Dhananand's confidante.
[Sanskrit shlok]
It means that Paraspura
is the ideal place
for us to seek refuge.
But gaining entry over there
will be extremely difficult.
But somehow if we get to enter there
we will be safe.
What happened, Dear Nishumbha?
Is your sixth sense hinting
you about somebody's presence?
The one whom
King Dhananand is trying to find
could be found in
this direction, is it?
Everybody take different
routes and reach Paraspura.
Ensure that no fresh
recruitments are done
in the region for the palace,
fort, business, or agriculture.
Inform King of Magadh, Dhananand
if anybody tries to do so.
Amatya, circulate this notice
to all the regions of the kingdom
immediately. Without any delay.
Sure, My Highness.
I, myself will circulate
this in every region.
Just let me know
where do I start with.
Paraspura!
So, this is Paraspura Region!
Yes.
That's the region's
Chief, Jagatjala's residence
in the center of the region.
Everybody is busy!
It seems as though preparations are
going on for some grand celebration.
Acharya, there seem to be more
soldiers than common men over here.
It may be extremely difficult
to seek refuge here.
That's exactly why
we chose this place.
If we want to stay safe
we have to take refuge
in Jagatjala's residence.
What?
But how will that be possible?
I have a plan for it.
I am sorry, friend.
Acharya, why did you
push that servant purposely?
To obtain this.
This is a special identity medal
which all of Jagajala's servants have.
All his permanent servants and maids
enter his residence only
with this identification medal.
Our first target is to obtain
these identification medals.
Because only this can save us
from Dhananand and his army.
Now this will protect us.
Friend, are you looking for this?
Yes.
Maybe it fell over there.
Thank you very much.
I'm thankful to you.
Stop please.
What are these arrangements for?
I am a traveller,
coming from a small town, Varshala.
I haven't seen such
a grand celebration, in my life.
Today is a very special day.
A very special and fierce
competition will take place
between our region chief,
Jagatjala's son, Martand
and the sons of the
other chiefs of the region.
All these arrangements are for that.
- Okay.
- I'll leave as I am getting delayed.
Competition! What type of competition?
The competition to prove
Jagatjala's son as the best.
But if he is truly ever so great
then why does his father arrange
for such a grand event
to prove his son's skill?
Since his son is
not the greatest of all.
Ones who truly are mighty
do not have to
demonstrate their power.
Only those who doubt their own power
end up boasting of their strength!
Jagatjala wants to run a show
where his weak son Martand
appears to be mighty in front
of the city so that he can establish
that his son is now able
to rule the city in his stead.
That is not how you hold it!
This is how you wield a sword!
Straight ahead!
Steady! Lift it!
Hold it upright! Keep it steady!
Do not let your wrists droop!
Keep them firm.
Martand, this is your final chance.
It is due to your weakness
that other chieftains grow bold
and now they challenge me!
They believe that you
cannot be a worthy successor.
I want you to defeat
their sons and silence them!
For eternity!
Remember this well.
This is not just about you!
Even my honour is at stake!
You have to win no matter what!
Or else you know how
I will make you suffer!
Please do not worry, Father.
I will not fail you.
Say it with confidence
and with iron will.
That you will win.
Father..
I will be the champion..
I wish to hear
a firmness in your voice!
Father..
I will be the winner.
My Lord.
He said he will be victorious.
Leave him be.
Get lost!
Know your place, woman!
Do not ever dare to meddle
amidst a Steward of
a city and his successor.
'Martand, this is your final chance.'
This tournament is
a golden chance for us.
You have to ascertain
Martand's victory
in the tournament of combat.
And if you do this
then we will be welcome
in the halls of Jagatjala.
After this announcement..
All of Magadh will be closed
to Chanakya and Chandragupta.
No one will grant them shelter.
It seems that Jagatjala
must have known of my arrival.
Yes, Councillor.
Allow me to inform you
that you have arrived
in Paraspura on a great day.
The Steward has arranged
for a tournament of combat
to show the might of his son.
Proceed!
He is Jagatjala,
landlord and Steward of Paraspura.
And he is Durgam Daga,
his younger brother.
I welcome you all.
You all know that I hold
a great rank and name.
I am the Steward of Paraspura
and the Lord of 40 villages.
And yet I have done my
duty in a selfless manner.
Just like my great Emperor Dhananand.
And I want this order
to be run by a capable leader.
As I do not wish to impose
my hand over the 40 villages
that lay under my care..
The one who wins this tournament
shall be named as
the Steward of Paraspura.
This is an act driven by foolishness.
Blinded by arrogance
he invites trouble!
I think that for now
he needs an advisor
and not a successor.
So that he can keep himself
from acting so foolish.
Even after knowing
that his son is an imbecile
he still proceeds with
such a daring attempt?
You think I need a political advisor
as my son would be
defeated in the tournament?
Do not be startled.
Nothing escapes me.
I can hear everything.
Now you shall see how
your son Pashupal fails
as he faces my son Martand.
Certainly, great one.
Acharya, you..
Silence.
If I try to assist him as an advisor
then I will be a suspect.
If this is the task that has to be
done we will have to think of a plan.
Stop worrying about me.
I will find some solution.
Chandragupta will get the entry sign
through Martand.
I have sent the queen
towards Jagat Jala's palace
to collect some information.
She will definitely
find some weak link
and find a way inside.
You and Stulbhadra are left.
Acharya.
I have vast knowledge about horses.
I may be able to enter the palace
through the horse stable.
Very good.
Let us go to the stable.
- It is time for the competition too.
- Okay, Acharya.
Prince, this is the first aid kit.
And this contains water.
Where is my servant?
Why has he not arrived yet?
I think he ran away due
to the fear of your defeat.
'The first competitor of
the competition is coming forward'
'and he will exhibit his strength.'
I will make a move, Martand.
You may not get a chance to exhibit
your strength after I go on stage.
What happened, Martand?
Has your servant not arrived?
I think you will have
to carry your bag on your own.
Do not be sad now.
I have a proposal for you.
Become my servant and carry my bag.
You will be able to witness
the competition at least.
'Pashupal is the next competitor.'
I will meet you after
the competition now.
I will make a move.
'Our next competition is
Chief Jagatjala's son, Martand.'
'Where is Martand?'
Why is he carrying his bag on his own?
Let alone 40 villages
he cannot even control his servant.
I am sorry, Your Majesty. I am late.
You?
Who are you?
And where is my servant?
Assume that I am your
servant for the day.
But I do not even know you.
Then..
Your Majesty, we will get ample time
to know each other
once the competition ends.
But you should just think
about the competition now.
You may be knowing the
rules of the competition.
Every competitor will
have to cross three levels
and they will have to collect
a flag after every level
which will be flying
in different places.
They will have to cross
the field in the first level
where there will be some obstacles.
They will find the first flag there.
And they will have to cross
a deep valley in the second level.
You have to hang on the
rope and cross the valley
and you will find the
flag at the other end.
The third and final
round is the chariot race
where you will find
the final victory flag.
And the competitor who
reaches the final point first
with all three flags
will be the winner.
Bring the three flags and fix it here.
Anybody who does this
first will be the winner.
Go. Emerge victorious!
Emerge victorious. Emerge victorious.
Emerge victorious.
Emerge victorious. Emerge victorious.
'Begin the first round
of the competition.'
Your Majesty,
you will lose the competition
if you walk in this speed.
Look how forward your
competitors have gone.
Do not scare me.
- I cannot walk faster.
- Come.
Come here. Come here.
Servant, what are you doing?
These leeches will drink your blood.
I will not give them time to do that.
Be careful.
'I will have to win this
competition for Martand somehow.'
'Our movement against
Dhananand's success'
'depends on this victory.'
The intention of a competitor
taking place in any
competition is clear.
Winning the competition.
But in order to get
some big victories in life
we will have to accept small defeats
because that is the demand
of the situation and time.
So, remember one thing.
Every defeat is not an
obstacle in the path of victory.
Some of them become ladders
and takes you closer
towards your destination.
My ethics..
Your deestiny.
Where is the second
horse of my chariot?
How will we take part
in the chariot race?

================================================================================

Episode: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmPlxX5I2Ew

Did you find any information?
Yes, Acharya.
Jagatjala is as evil
and cruel as Dhananand.
He hits his wife.
His wife is helpless.
There is no one to help
her or sympathise with her.
Great!
It means that you have found
a link to enter his mansion.
Yes.
I hope Chandra is all right.
This competition will be difficult.
Servant,
why are you taking a shortcut?
This path is more difficult
than the original path.
It has more Leeches.
Master, do not worry about me.
We will use this difficult
path to cross this level first.
You bore so much pain for me.
But why, servant?
So that I can
see you winning, master.
Greetings, Landlord.
We have received information
regarding the first level.
Your son, Martand, has crossed
the leech-filled field first.
Now, he is moving
towards the next level.
What?
Where is Kalki?
She should have been here.
Sitting here without
her is ruining my reputation.
After all,
I am the chief of this district.
Durgam, go and find her.
Where is she?
I think she will not come
to her senses with one slap.
After the competition, I will
have to teach her a good lesson.
The competition has started, my Lady.
The master is waiting for you.
Please hurry up.
Otherwise, he will be upset with you.
I know, Sirsa.
Your master deems waiting
for me as an insult to his person.
But I also know
that if I go to the guests
with this mark on my face
he will deem it his insult as well.
He will turn it into
a reason for his humiliation.
What do I do?
I have applied all the pastes
prescribed by the physician.
But.. But this mark..
I am unable to get rid of this mark.
My Lady, take this.
This is a special paste.
Perhaps, it may be of use to you.
You.. Who are you?
I am a woman
who understands the
pain of another woman.
Sister-in-law!
Instead of sitting
next to your husband
and enjoying the competition
you are getting decked-up here!
By the way,
getting decked-up is beyond your age.
Loving yourself so much
is not suitable for you.
Anyway, men do not have enough time
to relish the beauty of a woman.
We have many important
tasks to take care of.
Hurry up.
Amazing!
Who is this celestial beauty?
She is not wearing
the mark of a servant.
For security purposes,
I will have to inspect her.
She is my special maid.
Look at this.
Let us go, maid.
'I have entered this mansion,
Chandra.'
'I hope that you and all
our comrades obtain this mark soon.'
Hurry up, master.
We are ahead of everyone.
Just cross this stage
by hanging from this
rope and take that flag!
No, servant.
I am unable of hanging from this rope.
But do not worry.
Because of you, we have come far.
I can walk to cross this stage.
And.. And get that flag.
Stop, master!
That is not soil, but a bog!
Servant! Help me out!
Master, calm down and be still.
The more you move,
the more you will sink.
Poor Martand.
He wanted to become the chief.
He does not know the difference
between soil and a bog.
How will he differentiate
between humans?
Servant..
Do something! Help me out of here!
Listen, servant.
I will not be able to
continue in this competition.
For whatever you have done for me,
I heartily thank you.
Go back.
I will wait for my father here.
He will come here and
take me home to punish me.
But please go back. I deserve this.
I.. I have lost, servant.
Master, one does not lose by falling.
One loses by not putting in efforts.
Please calm down.
I will come there and help you out.
But we have to finish
what we have started.
Be still. I will be right there.
Master! Give me your hand!
Give me your hand! Try harder!
Thank you, servant.
Thank me after you win.
We have to work hard to earn a win.
Hurry up.
We have to go for the chariot race.
Come on.
Come, master.
Go, master, and get that flag.
Go! Hurry up!
Where is the second
horse of my chariot?
How will we take part
in the chariot race?
Without the other horse,
how will we complete this race?
Why did the servant
not bring my horse yet?
You fool! Hold the horse! Control it!
The landlord's son, Martand,
must be waiting for us. Hurry up!
Indra, take this herb
and give it to the horse.
It will calm down.
Do remember to not
give more than two leaves.
- Yes, Acharya.
- Go.
What happened to the horse?
This foolish boy fed
the horse at the wrong time.
That is why it became uncontrolled.
This horse runs very fast.
The landlord's son
must be waiting for it.
It is important to control it.
I do not know as to what I should do.
Do this.
Feed it Datura.
It will immediately calm down.
- Take it.
- What is this?
Will the horse eat it?
First, feed it to the horse.
- Boy! Come here. Take it.
- Feed only two leaves..
Amazing! This is a miracle!
I needed a knowledgeable
and capable person like you.
Will you work for us?
I was looking for a job.
From today, you can work with us.
Thank you.
Everything is going according
to our plan, Chandragupta.
We will talk about this later.
It is important for this horse
to reach somewhere else, right?
Yes.. Boy! Listen to me carefully.
Take this horse to the
third stage of the competition.
Hurry up..
At least, tell me your name.
I do not like to address
you as a servant.
You can address me as Arjun.
Come on, we have to win this race.
These three are not allowing
one another to move ahead.
How will we win?
You do not need to worry
when I am here, master.
"Oh, Chandragupta Maurya!"
"Oh, Chandragupta Maurya!"
"Oh, Chandragupta Maurya!
Chandragupta Maurya!"
"Chandragupta Maurya!"
March ahead, master.
Victory is awaiting you.
I do not know how
I will pay your debt.
How shall I express
my gratitude for your help?
I do not even have
words to thank you, Arjun.
Let that be, master. March ahead!
My son!
Hail Martand! Hail Chief Jagatjala!
Hail Martand! Hail Chief Jagatjala!
Hail Martand! Hail Chief Jagatjala!
Hail Martand! Hail Chief Jagatjala!
It seems
that my mother and Indra have
earned their spots in this mansion.
It means that we have
won half the battle.
Even luck is favouring our faith.
Now, you cannot stop us, Dhananand.
Son
now there is no one here
apart from the three of us.
Now, tell me the truth.
I am aware of your
capabilities and competence.
Who was behind your victory?
Answer me!
I asked you to answer my question!
Well.. My servant.
I became victorious with his help.
- Servant?
- Yes, Father.
I was going to introduce him to you.
For that,
he needs to be with you, you fool!
Where is that servant?
Who are you?
I have not seen you
in Paraspura before.
I know every citizen of Paraspura.
Tell me. What is your name?
Where are you from? What do you do?
What was your motive behind
making my son win the competition?
What are your caste and creed?
God does not bless
someone to be talented
on the basis of caste and creed.
And a great person does not question
the one with talent.
Both God and the great person
show mercy towards the talented one.
What do you want to say?
It is done.
I want to say that
capability and competence
do not discriminate
on the basis of caste.
Talent is not limited
to a family or race.
It is the gift that
is bestowed by God.
A person is born with these gifts
without knowing who
or what that person is.
Only the person's deeds,
capability and talent
are his identity.
Rest is useless.
How did such talented
and knowledgeable people
come suddenly to Paraspura?
Brother, Amatya Rakshas
is soon reaching Paraspura with
King Dhananand's important letter.
'Amatya Rakshas is coming
here with Dhananand's letter.'
'It means that we do not have
much time to enter the mansion.'
'We have to attain our goal soon.'
How long will it
take to reach Paraspura?
We will reach there
within three hours, Amatya.
Hurry up! We do not have much time.
The philosopher's stone
has a special ability.
It makes the things
it touches invaluable
by turning them into gold.
That is why everyone wants to gain it.
Similarly, a talented person
turns the lives
of those who live with him great.
That is why
if we allow a talented person
into our lives
who can brighten our personality and life
with his influence
then trust me
our life can become invaluable too.
My ethics..
Your destiny.
There is only one way
to stay safe from all this.
You must get that entry
symbol at the earliest.
Do not worry, Acharya.
I will not let any of Dhananand's
plans to hinder our path.

================================================================================

Episode: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JfJ95Q5Dok

Suddenly, how did so many intellects
and brilliant people
come to Paraspura.
Brother, Amatya is coming to Paraspura
with Emperor Dhananand's
special message.
'Amatya Rakshas is coming here
with Dhananand's special message?'
'That means the time for us
to enter the palace is reducing.'
'We will have fulfill our goal.'
Durgam
arrange for a grand welcome
for the Amatya. As soon as possible.
Yes, Brother.
Who are you?
You can see,
sir, I am an ordinary barber.
But why does your speech
seem like an intellect?
I said, capability doesn't
see caste and status.
And then,
Magadh Emperor is also a barber.
Time is changing, sir.
And for that
how much ever we thank
Emperor Dhananand is less.
Because of him, we barbers
are famous throughout the world.
Honestly speaking, because
of him our caste has been empowered.
And he has proved
that it is not the destiny of
a barber to just cut someone's hair.
But we have to be careful
about one more thing.
If we wish the barbers to flourish
and the future generations
also enjoy this
then we have to take
the path of education.
Hence it is very important
that we get educated.
And we encourage brilliant people.
The talent of a barber
and the thinking of an intellect
seeing both these in one person,
I am very happy.
'Right now, he does not need an heir'
'he needs a political consultant.'
Today someone advised me
that I should appoint a capable
and intelligent political consultant.
From today, you will stay with me.
Thank you. Thank you, sir.
From today I appoint you as
my political consultant. Take this.
What are you saying, sir?
Thank you very much.
Thank you very much.
'Very good. Acharya has also
confirmed his place in the palace.'
'Now only Stul and I are remaining.'
'But I will get entry
soon due to Martand'
'Then only Stul will be remaining.'
'I will get him a place
in the palace anyhow.'
Father..
Today Arjun helped me
a lot in the competition.
Should we appoint him too?
No.
There is something in
this boy that is stopping me.
I am unable to trust him.
And anyway, for one day,
we have assigned enough people.
Now no more appointments.
Now let us go from here.
'Before the meeting of
Jagatjala and Amatya Rakshas.'
'if Chandragupt doesn't
get this entry token'
'then it will be impossible
for us to stay in Paraspura.'
If Dhananand has
sent Amatya Rakshas here
then there surely must
be some purpose behind this.
Amatya Rakshas must have
brought news about Dhananand
which will add to our difficulties.
It will make our task more difficult.
There is only one way
to stay safe from all this.
You must get that entry
symbol at the earliest.
And there is only one way to get that.
Martand.
Do not worry, Acharya.
I will not let our victory
to turn into defeat.
I will not let any of Dhananand's
plans to hinder our path.
Your Highness,
gaining control over Asaka
has proved useful for us.
Our treasury is filled with
gold and other precious items.
Besides, the new king of Asaka
Jungi Dev has thanked
you by paying twice the tax
for appointing him for this position.
Tell Jungi Dev that
he must pay double the tax.
Your Highness,
that is what I told you.
Twice as much tax has been sent.
Great.
Your Highness,
you are undoubtedly present here
but something is surely
distracting your mind.
Does your wound hurt?
- I will rub medicine..
- No!
My mind is not distracted by this pain
but because of the
person who gave this pain.
I do not want
my wound to heal.
Because if this wound heals,
then my pain will be gone.
If my pain is gone,
then I will not feel angry
and if I do not feel anger,
I will not be able to take revenge!
That is why I do not
want my wound to heal.
So that this fire of
revenge never settles down.
So that it keeps burning
until I kill Chandragupta!
Your Highness, what are you thinking?
I am thinking
that I have charged double
the tax from the people of Asaka.
They have filled our treasury
with their hard earned wealth.
This must be a tough time
for people of Asaka.
And you know very well
who gets affected the most
when the poor are victimised?
Chandragupta.
'No matter what the situation'
'whenever there are
atrocities on the weak'
'he always arrives to help.'
'He does not even mind
risking his own life for that.'
And this very compassion will
become the reason for his death.
Bhadrasal..
Make preparations to
send a message at once.
I want to send two messages this time.
One for Daahak and Nishumbha
and the other one for
my dear friend Jagatjala.
Sure, Your Majesty.
Stay away from that servant, Martand.
I think his company
is not right for you.
Town Head, Amatya Rakshas
is waiting for you in the court.
Fine, I will be there.
Martand..
I did not get time to congratulate
you for your amazing victory.
Come with us.
We want to congratulate you.
Come. Come, Martand.
Come.
- Come, come.
- Come.
It seems that all your powers
have come into your feet.
That is why you ran so fast.
Faster than all of us.
But your remaining body is still weak.
Look, look his weak body
cannot even stand in front of us.
Don't trouble me.
Go away from here
otherwise I will call my father.
He will not spare all of you.
Threaten someone else Markand.
I very well know that if you
complain to your father about us
then not us but you will be punished.
He will surely punish you
for this weakness of yours.
Go Markand.
Go!
Complain about me to your father. Go.
What are you waiting for? Go.
You are a sprinter, are you not?
Then, run.
Let me see how fast you are.
What happened?
Run. Why are you still here?
Run!
Run!
Who are you?
Did you not recognise him?
He was that servant of
Martand in the competition.
Listen, you pest.
Talking to servants like you
is a disgrace to us. Go away.
Sure.
And fighting with the likes you
is a disgrace to my master.
That is why he is not
raising a hand against you
and is tolerating you.
Because he knows that I, his servant
am enough to deal with you.
Let us deal with this pest, first.
We will teach a lesson
to this coward later.
All right.
But do not complain later
that I did not warn you.
"Chandragupta.."
"Chandragupta.."
"He is a warrior. Chandragupta."
"His sight is as sharp as a blade.
Chandragupta."
"He is brave and patient.
He is the base of a race."
"He is logical and intelligent.
He has the magnificence of the sun."
"He is Chandragupta Maurya!"
"Chandragupta!"
Who are you?
I have never seen
someone as brave as you.
You are amazing!
Your hands are so hard and strong.
You knocked them all out in one go.
How?
That does not matter.
I am happy that you are safe.
By the way, thank you for
recommending me to your father.
I am just glad that you did
so much for a petty servant like me.
I will always be thankful to you.
Thank you very much.
I will have to leave
for the palace now.
It was nice meeting you again.
Very good!
You need not do anything now.
Because by helping Martand
you have gained entry
into the palace of Jagatjala.
Because after what
you have done for Martand
he must be thinking of
you as his protective shield.
He will do anything
to have you with him.
Congratulations, Prince Chandragupta!
You will soon be getting
an invitation from the palace.
Father, you must employ Arjun.
Martand, I have already told you.
My decision is final.
Father, he is skilled at many things.
I assure you.
His company will
not be harmful for me.
In fact, I will get training
from him and make you proud.
Father, this is the first time
I am asking you for something.
Please trust my decision.
Please allow him to come here.
Your Highness, I have never seen my
son requesting so much for anything.
In fact, Martand has been
alone since his childhood.
He has no friends at all.
Think of it as giving him a friend.
So be it.
Give him the entry symbol
and bring him inside the palace.
'Thank God! Even Chandragupta
will get this entry sign soon.'
'Now my only worry is'
'why Dhananand has sent Amatya here.'
I apologise, Amatya.
I was held up with a personal matter.
I am now at your service.
Tell me, what is your command for me?
I have a declaration
from King Dhananand.
Read it.
'I, Dhananand,
the emperor of Magadha, order you'
'that from the moment
you read this letter'
'there should not be any
new recruitment in your palace.'
'The reason is, there are
some traitors hiding among us.'
'These enemies need
a place to hide from me.'
'They might try to hide in
any part of Magadha under disguise.'
Amatya, do we have a threat?
Yes.
Father, did you send for me?
Amatya, meet my son, Martand.
Greetings, Amatya!
It is a pleasure meeting you.
Even I am pleased to meet you.
I heard that you just won a competition.
Congratulations!
Thank you.
All thanks to my servant..
We are discussing
something very important.
You may leave.
Amatya, you were telling
me something about him.
It is about Chandragupta,
the servant of the king
who dared to revolt against Magadha.
He is just a teenager
but he is very manipulative.
He is trying to hide Chanakya
and his other aides in Magadha
using those tricks.
King Dhananand has ordered
you to find him at the earliest.
'Dhananand's message must have
made Jagatjala suspicious about me.'
'I am afraid we will get caught.'
Identity.
Identity is very important.
There is only reason
for whatever a person
does in his life.
He wants to make his
own identity in the world.
But how do we do it?
We must remember
here that one's identity
is not about his name, work and caste
but it is about his deeds.
Hence, do good deeds.
By doing so
you will always hold
a special identity
of yourself in this world.
The ethics are mine.
The destiny is yours.
I have made an amazing
plan to find the slave.
You cannot become a good
swordsman with these sticks.
Stay here. I will go
and arrange for our training.
There is something
fishy about this servant.
I will have to follow him.

================================================================================

Episode: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaxSeCyCZVs

King Dhananand has ordered us
to find the servant,
Chandragupta, and Chanakya
as soon as possible.
Tell the king to be rest assured.
I will make sure the
traitor is caught soon.
Good.
Very good.
I will take your leave now.
I had a narrow escape.
- Durgam.
- Yes, Brother.
Keep an eye on the
boy whom I have appointed
as Martand's servant.
As you wish, Brother.
We have received
this important message
from King Dhananand's messenger bird.
Amatya Rakshas just visited us.
So, why was this message sent?
Give it to me.
'I am sending one
of my army commanders'
'to the village, Bandhi,
which is under your jurisdiction.'
'He will recover the tax
from the people of that region.'
'He will torture
the weak and the poor'
'and if need be,
he will sentence them to death.'
'It will send a message
to entire empire'
'regarding the consequences
of neglecting my orders.'
'I want you to spread
this message in your district'
'like the forest fire.'
'I trust'
'that you will accomplish
this task properly'
'and not let me down.'
Perhaps, this will be
a golden opportunity for you
to reach your target.
'I believe that after announcing
this in Jagatjala's district'
'Chandragupta will definitely
come with his army'
'to help those weak and poor people.'
'As it will take
you time to reach there'
'I have made sure
to confuse your prey.'
'I have sent my army commander,
Chumbak Singh, there.'
'He will keep hunting
down Chandragupta'
'and his Kshatriya army
until you reach there.'
Spread this message
throughout the district
that tax has to be recovered
from the village, Bandhi.
Father, I want to practice
swordsmanship with Arjun.
Can I take two swords
from our armoury for the same?
The great king of Magadh, Dhananand
has given me an important task.
Yet, you are here to ask me
about your useless training!
We have to spread the news
throughout the districts of Magadh
that Village Bandhi will
be subjected to tax recovery
to set an example
of the consequences of
neglecting the king's orders.
Let us go, Durgam.
Nishumbha, you have to attack.
This opportunity must not be wasted.
We have to reach Bandhi
as soon as possible.
We will not disappoint the king.
My friend, I could not
get the swords from the armoury.
We have to practice
using these sticks.
What happened, master? Why do you
seem worried and disappointed?
What is the problem?
Actually, my father has received an
important message from King Dhananand.
Due to my ignorance, I troubled him.
Come, let us start the training.
What was the special
message from Magadh?
It was regarding tax recovery.
'Tax will be recovered from Bandhi'
'to set an example
of the consequences'
'of neglecting the king's orders.'
Attack me, master.
'I will have to inform Acharya
and the others about the same.'
'For that, I will have
to call an emergency meeting.'
I have a great idea to turn
your disappointment into happiness.
Do you want to listen
to a bird's call?
It is Chandragupta's signal.
'This is Chandra's secret signal.'
'I will have to reach
our secret place soon.'
I am sure that Chandragupta has
received some news about Dhananand.
Great!
This art is amazing.
You are so talented and capable.
Truly, you are special.
I know that.
But you cannot become
a ood swordsman with these sticks.
Stay here. I will go
and arrange for our training.
Brother was right.
There is something
fishy about this servant.
I will have to follow him.
Acharya, the news is dire.
Dhananand has sent
his special troop or tax recovery
to a village named Bandhi
which is already
in a state of poverty.
Those who have not paid the
tax will be sentenced to death.
I will not let this happen, Acharya.
You are right, Chandra.
We cannot let that evil Dhananand
succeed with his plans.
Of course, Your Highness.
We will not let this happen.
But we have to be careful.
This can be Dhananand's ploy
to flush us out of hiding.
But, Acharya
if we do not help them,
no one will help them.
If we stand up to help them
then even they will
help us when needed.
Moreover, our plan was
to gain the support
of Magadh's subjects
and weaken Dhananand's roots, Acharya.
So, we cannot lose this opportunity.
All right.
But we have to be
careful about what we do.
Trouble can befall us from anywhere.
I am sure that the servant
went into that building.
But what is he doing there?
Indra, inform all the Kshatriyas here
that we have to mobilise towards
Village Bandhi as soon as possible.
I think someone is coming here.
I heard a few people talking in here.
- Who was here?
- Why would anyone come here?
I came here to clean up.
You have
such beautiful, yet strong arms.
They look like those of a warrior.
Oh, my..
A handmaiden must not
walk away from her master.
You must serve me.
Come to my chamber to serve me.
And then
your arms
will not have this rubbish
but gold ornaments.
My job here is done.
Allow me to leave.
Is everything okay?
What was he asking?
Why are you anxious?
'No..'
'If any of them find out'
'about what Durgam did'
'they will lose focus
and get worried for me.'
What is the matter?
Nothing.
I was nervous wondering
if he heard our conversation.
But he hasn't seen or heard anything.
Before people start
suspecting our absence
I must leave.
Good luck for your motive.
Stop! Be cautious.
'It is the truth, Your Highness.'
'Chandragupta deceived us all.'
'The Prince of Piplivan'
'wants to avenge his kingdom's
destruction from our King.'
'That is all he wants.'
My darling sister!
I am here to tell you
such a splendid strategy
that instead of painting
such a withered flower
you will paint something attractive
which will be colourful, full of hope
and will have life to it.
Do you not want to hear
what I am talking about?
You must listen. I have made
an amazing plan to find the slave.
One that I have not
shared with anyone.
I am here to share that
strategy with only you.
Listen to me, please, Durdhara.
I am certain
after you hear my strategy
you will be delighted.
All right. So tell me. Tell me!
The strategy goes
like this..
I have sent word across
the kingdom that my Commander
Chumbak Singh will be
heading to the village Bandhi
to collect taxes, and he must
not be expected to be merciful
as I have sent him
to torture the people.
When the lowborn Chandragupta
that cunning Brahman Chanakya,
Mura and the Kshatriyas hear this
they will offer help and for that,
they will have to
leave their hide-out.
When Chandragupta and
his army reach Bandhi Village
they will find the soldiers of Magadh
torturing people
but the truth will be..
The truth will remain that those
helpless and weak people
will be posing as soldiers of Magadh.
If you wish to live
wear this armour
and carry these weapons.
The soldiers of Magadha will be hiding
in people's houses
waiting for the enemy.
Chandragupta and his army
will attack the weak and helpless
mistaking them for the soldiers.
But when the betrayer Chandragupta
will call himself a victor
after killing those weaklings
the soldiers of Magadh
will have enough time
to captive them.
Your men have tried that many times
and failed!
And yet you think you will succeed?
I do because this time
the soldiers will fight Chandragupta
and his army only
to keep them occupied.
The truth is that
the best assassins I have
Dahak and Nishumbha will get hold on them
who are proceeding towards
Chandragupta and his army
and I am certain that
they will not disappoint me.
I hope you succeed.
So you are yet not
sure that I will succeed.
But soon,
all your doubts will be cleared
and soon, you will start
to believe your brother again.
And then
you would never paint withered flowers
as after the execution of my strategy
the lowborn Chandragupta
and the cunning Chanakya
will be in my captivity.
I, Chumbak Singh,
am here upon the orders of the King.
And the only reason I am here
is to collect more tax from you.
But, Lord Chumbak,
we gave you all we had.
Now, we have nothing more to give,
but our lives.
This man speaks a lot.
He must be taught a lesson first.
Do you see this wheel?
This spike is on top right now.
When in motion,
the next spike takes its place
and then the next and every next spike
takes the place of the previous one.
That is how the wheel stays in motion.
In an empire, just as this wheel
heritage comes into play.
After the demise of a king,
his son is crowned the king.
There is nothing wrong about it.
But there is one condition.
The heir of the king must be
as good of a leader and capable enough
of handling the
affairs of the kingdom.
Else, the people of the
kingdom have to pay a price.
The ones that come under
such a wheel are the innocent people
and their futures.
In that case,
an uncontrollable wheel can be stopped
only by choosing a worthy ruler
who can stop the anarchy
going on since decades
who can take the
kingdom towards progress
who can yet again fix the wheel
and put it in proper motion.
My ethics..
Your destiny.
Acharya, this army is not
trained for fighting a battle.
We have been cheated.
They are not soldiers.
- What?
- Look at their shields.
They are not fitting
their body properly.

================================================================================

Episode: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zul4PW-bfJg

Attack!
Acharya..
This army does not seem strong
or experienced enough to fight.
Deception! We have been deceived.
- They are not truly soldiers.
- What!
Look at their armour.
It does not fit them well.
Pay attention to how they
are carrying their swords.
This means that Dhananand
dressed innocent people
as his soldiers to mislead us.
But where are
the real soldiers of Magadh?
There!
In the houses of the people.
No!
Let us go!
Innocent people of Bandhi,
save yourselves.
Escape while we fight these soldiers.
Run!
"He is a striking force on the enemy!
Chandragupta."
"His sight is as sharp as a blade.
Chandragupta."
"He is Chandragupta Maurya.."
"He is Chandragupta Maurya.."
"He is Chandragupta Maurya..
Chandragupta."
It appears that
the Kshatriya are winning.
If we lose this opportunity,
the King will kill us.
Nishumbha, focus! Find him.
He is in that direction.
That is where our target is.
Our target is still alive.
You must stay cautious, Chandragupta.
It appears,
someone else is part of this fight
who wants to kill you.
We must end all this right here,
right now.
Thank you, Baldev!
How could he save
himself from my attack?
Nobody has ever escaped my attacks.
Before he runs away,
we must get to him.
We are late. Everyone escaped!
Kshatriya?
They are headed towards Paraspura.
They went that way.
Look, Your Highness!
I have cooked your favourite food.
'Aloo Saag',
'Dal Kachori', 'Moong Dal Halwa'
and laddoos with pure ghee.
I am salivating just talking about it.
If you are salivating,
you may enjoy the food.
I am not interested.
And I know very well what
my sister is interested in.
I have brought something for you
which will please you
and you will smile again.
Another rare gem?
I have so many gems you have given me.
They will last a lifetime.
- I do not want another one.
- No.. No! No, Sister.
This is no ordinary gem.
This was mined from
the caves of Gandhar.
It is a unique and rare thorn gem.
The thorns are invisible.
It is as beautiful
as it is deadly.
If someone holds it in his fist
it can kill that person.
When the lowborn
Chandragupta will be caught
you must give him this gem.
When you watch him
die you will be delighted.
I see a reflection of
my personality in you the most,
among my seven siblings.
So I am aware of what
will make you happy and when.
Your Majesty!
Is the slave caught? Where is he?
Answer me!
- Answer my sister, Bhadrasaal!
- My apologies, Your Majesty
but the news is bad.
Chumbak Singh, tell me about it.
Your Majesty, we followed
your instructions diligently
but the Kshatriya are more
cunning than we thought.
Before we could do anything,
they turned the tables.
Pardon us, Your Majesty!
No! Why are you apologising,
Chumbak Singh?
You followed the commands
of your king very diligently.
You must be proud of your actions,
not ashamed!
You deserve a reward,
not a punishment.
This.. This is the reward
which you must hold on
to until your very last breath.
Your strategy failed again.
You failed to catch the slave again.
Why does that not bother you, Brother?
No.. No, Sister.
My plan did not fail. Rather..
My plan has just begun.
I do not follow.
I knew that my soldiers
would fail to catch Chandragupta
but this attack was only
to ascertain that Chandragupta
and his Kshatriya
army were near Bandhi
and this is how the assassins
that I hired now know
where they need to attack.
Life has ended!
I promise you, Durdhara
that soon,
Chandragupta will be holding this gem
and this is how he will die too.
The people of Bandhi gave us
this as a gesture of gratitude.
We protected them all from
Chumbak Singh and the soldiers.
So in return,
they have sent this dessert for us.
We have brought trust into
the hearts of people of Bandhi.
We must do the same
to the other 39 villages.
That is when we will be ready
for war against Dhananand.
Acharya..
Tell us our next strategy.
The next strategy is
that we will do nothing.
What!
Acharya, we just had a victory.
We are a step closer towards our goal.
We have the passion and determination.
Then why do we wait?
Acharya, I believe,
we should spread our revolution
like wildfire,
among all the other villages
so that we can get more
men from those villages.
You have always acted in haste.
Do you remember the repercussions?
I agree that you were
victorious with Bandhi village.
No matter how restless you get
fearing the darkness of the night
the sun rises when it has to.
Besides,
I have not forgotten that dagger
that came flying from
an unknown direction.
What!
Yes, Lady.
Not only the soldiers of
Magadh wish to kill Chandragupta
but there is another
enemy desperate to kill him.
Someone who is an expert
in hiding after attacking.
His goal and ideas are crystal clear.
What was that? What are you doing?
I want to send this
message to King Dhananand
to inform him that
the target is in Paraspura
and that we are headed
there so that the King informs
the lord there, who is his friend.
This will make our job easier
and we will be able
to kill him faster.
We have been assigned
this job not because it is easy
but because nobody
other than us can do this.
Tell me, has anyone
ever escaped your attack?
No! Only this one!
This is good enough reason
to do this job on our own
without anyone's help or support.
And until the job is done
you must not send
any messages to the King.
All right.
But I wonder why I feel that
it is not as easy as we think.
And that is why I am
more interested in doing this.
For the first time,
we have true competition.
We need to stay cautious.
Whoever tried to kill Chandragupta
is close to us.
Perhaps, they are heading towards us.
Stul!
If they are in Paraspura
we must stay in this palace
and ambush our enemy.
And while we stay here,
we can keep an eye on them.
When the time is right,
we will attack him.
But for that,
we need to have access to enter.
Motherhood has always
helped assassins.
You know, Chandra,
I have been wandering for so long.
I am so tired that I think
I lost some weight too.
Look, let me enter that palace
or I will jump into this pot
and drown myself.
Fine, Stul, do not worry.
Give me some time
to arrange something.
What happened?
Why did you want to see me?
My father is unwell.
He is breathing his last.
You always have
a new excuse to skip work.
I do not care if your father dies
but what is certain is
that you will not get a leave.
Please, Lord!
Master, just for a few days!
In my absence,
my brother will do all my work.
I request you to allow
my sister to be your handmaiden.
- Please!
- Your sister?
You will not be
disappointed by my work.
Rest assured.
I have learnt all
the duties of the palace.
Trust me, you will not be troubled.
He will do everything properly.
All right, you may go.
Chandragupta, we must stay cautious.
Do not forget that
we are on enemy lands.
We have no idea what direction
they might come from.
So do not engage in acts
that could draw attention to you
or we might get into trouble.
Besides, we have no idea
who that unknown enemy is
who attacked Chandragupta.
Do you see this torch?
It is not as radiant to fade
the darkness away in the chamber.
But..
When this torch is
used to light many others
there is so much light
that the entire house can
light up and not just a chamber.
This is similar to
the spark of courage
which starts with one
but later,
when it is instilled in others
the light grows so much
that the deepest darkness
of injustice can be fade away.
And so, you must not
surrender to injustice.
You must face it,
bravely, and you will succeed.
My ethics..
Your destiny.
Your future is going to get brighter.
Just like this necklace.
'If Chandra does something
then our secret will be revealed.'
'We all will be in trouble.'

================================================================================

Episode: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDx_QHxVH74

'Who could be the
one sent by Dhananand?'
'Whoever he is..'
'Is he somewhere around us?'
'Is he searching for me?'
'How much information
does he have about me?'
Lakha!
Tell me, my political advisor.
The incident which took
place in Village Bandi..
What do you have to say about it?
My Lord.
I think
instead of asking for my opinion
on this matter it would be better
if you ask for the opinion of a person
whose reaction and comments
have never been valued.
One, whom you have never listened to.
One, who is present here despite
his insignificant contribution.
For example..
Your son, Martand.
Him!
He never has anything to say.
If you do not believe me,
see for yourself.
So, Martand.
Whatever happened in Village Bandi
do you have anything
to say about that?
I think before taking any action
against the people of Village
Bandi and torturing them
we should ask them
as to why they supported
those revolutionists
instead of the army of Magadh.
Were they subjected to any injustice
by our administration
and governing body?
Did you hear what he said?
May I say something
if you promise to pardon me?
I feel that
your son's thoughts are very noble.
I would say that..
In the future..
It is up to you,
whether you agree or not.
But in every issue
you must seek his opinion.
My Lord!
Sorry for interrupting.
Some sage who is observing
silence is here to meet you.
He seeks your permission to come in.
Chief of Paraspura does
not have time for such people.
My Lord, I have heard
that if a sage returns from your house
it is considered a bad omen.
It was my duty to inform you.
My Lord!
I think sometimes you should meet
such common people as well.
You see, they feel
that you are fulfilling your duties.
And we should also find out
what such people are thinking.
Let's meet him.
Bring him in.
Open your eyes!
See our reverend sage is here.
All hail the sage!
He is the great, reverend
sage, who observes silence!
He took the vow of
silence when he was four.
After that he started
making prophecies.
Let me tell you
that till date, all the prophecies..
All the prophecies
made by him have come true.
Because of his divine powers
he is able to foresee the future.
Stop bragging about him.
First of all, he will have
to greet the most important person..
Chief of the assembly.
He is such a foolish sage.
He is not aware as
to who the chief is.
He is my elder.
My brother.
The chief of the assembly
and the chief of this province.
Sire Jagatjala.
The sage says..
This boy is the most
important person here.
He is the future of Paraspura!
This boy!
He will be the best
chief of this province!
No one has ever been like him
nor will there be
anyone like him ever.
Sage made a prophecy.
Martand will become the
best chief of the province.
Amazing! Yes, this is amazing..
Yes, this is amazing.. Amazing.
Amazing! Yes, this is amazing..
Sage.
I do not trust anything that
you have said about my son, Martand.
But if you can foresee my son's future
there must be something special.
Handmaid!
Make the boarding
and lodging arrangements
for the sage and his disciple.
Make sure they are
given proper hospitality.
'Now that we have gained
entry into this palace'
'we can do anything.'
'I must find mother
soon and inform her'
'that even Stul is
now inside the palace.'
Listen, beautiful lady.
Your future is going to get brighter.
Just like this necklace.
If you do not believe me
go ask the great sage
about your future.
He has just come to the palace.
But accept
this gift of mine first.
Take it.
Thank you.
But I do not need this gift.
Please take it.
I am an admirer of your beauty.
Take it. I said, take it!
Servant!
Why are you loafing around the palace?
You have been hired to serve
Prince Martand, have you not?
Go, take care of him.
Why are you here?
Go. His sword must have got dirty.
Go, clean it.
Pardon me. I will do that right away.
And then water the plants
get Martand's clothes washed
and bathe his horses.
- Mother, he is gone.
- And then
organise his room.
Arrange for his departure.
- Mother..
- Go, do it!
Mother!
Durgam Daga is gone!
What is it, mother? What happened?
No! Nothing..
Go, do your work. Go.
What is going on?
Acharya.
Acharya,
something is wrong with mother.
I am observing this
since a couple of days.
She is behaving strange.
I think something is wrong.
Chandragupta,
your mother is a capable woman.
She can take care of herself.
And if she needs our help,
she will ask us.
Until then,
we should respect her emotions.
We are now in the
clutches of our enemies.
Any danger might
strike us at any moment.
Be cautious, I told you.
Now leave.
Sage.. Sage..
Sage, please tell me my future.
For how long will I live alone?
The sage is here only
for the King and his family.
Get out!
Okay, Sage.
I will find a girl for myself.
Long live the sage!
Sage.
Your lunch is here.
'He cannot be just
another normal servant.'
'How can a servant be so skilled?'
'I will have to find
out more about her.'
Chandragupta, what you did
in the palace today was inappropriate.
Do not showcase your skills openly.
Especially, before that maid.
Acharya,
then you must have also observed
that even she was strange.
Yes.
Considering her skill and swiftness
I am sure that she
is not a normal maid.
Please let me go.
I did what you asked me to do.
Now please spare my son and husband.
My son must be crying without me.
Yes. We will not
say anything to anyone.
We will even leave Paraspura.
Please tell me where my wife is.
She must be very scared.
Yes. She was very scared.
But only until I told her
that she will not face more pain.
Yes. And about your son
the moment I told him that
he is going to meet his mother
he became quiet.
What do you mean?
Do you want to know that?
Let me show you.
My son..
- Help! Help!
- Help! Help!
- Somebody please help.
- Let me get out.
- Help! Help!
- Help! Help!
- Help! Help!
- Help! Help!
- Somebody please help.
- Let me get out.
- Help! Help!
- Help! Help!
What happened, Nishumbha?
Why do you look worried?
Because I met a strange servant today.
Arjun Akhetak..
He was not an ordinary servant.
He seemed like an expert.
He was swift. He was alert.
He was skilled.
I felt he was a warrior
and not a servant.
Yes.
He had all the qualities of a warrior.
We will have to find
out this Arjun's truth.
Chandragupta, we need to be careful.
Keep an eye on her.
I know you very well, Sister.
Just how there is
no smoke without fire
you also do not get
a doubt without any reason.
If you have a doubt on Arjun
I will definitely find out about him.
Who is he?
Where has he come from?
Does he have any connection
with Chandragupta?
I will stay in the palace
and find out about him.
I will find out the truth.
Do not worry, Your Majesty.
I am sure that you will perform well
in the target practice.
'This man? Who is he?'
'I have not seen him here before.'
'Jagatjala has not appointed'
'a new person after
Dhananand's announcement.'
'Who is he then?
And how did he enter the palace?'
'She is the same maid who
has just been appointed by Kalki.'
Durgeshwari,
where are you going in a hurry?
That man..
He? He is new.
He is Agjeev's brother.
Agjeev's father was unwell.
So, he has gone to the village.
His brother is handling all
the work of the palace in his absence.
Oh! Okay.
I do not care.
I am going to complete
the gardening work.
Listen.
Now that we spoke about the servants
even I wanted to ask you something.
What do you know about Arjun Akhetak?
Who?
The one who is the
favourite servant of Martand
the son of the chief of your village.
Pull the string properly, Martand.
Aim at the target.
You cannot do anything, Martand.
Your Majesty,
I am sorry for arriving unannounced.
We need your seal on these documents.
Your Majesty, keep your elbow high.
The hand holding the
bow should be straight.
The arrow should be
between the eyes and ears.
Keep your finger down.
Leave it.
Father.
I did it, Father.
I did it.
Martand, you are not as useless
as I thought you were.
Did you see that, Durgeshwari?
He is very skilled.
He made that useless boy
a strong and confident archer.
This servant makes me feel curious.
Where has he come from? Who is he?
And how did he reach
this position so soon?
'This maid was also appointed
few days ago in the palace.'
'And she is suspecting
Chandragupta now.'
'I will have to inform Acharya Chanakya
and Chandra about this very soon.'
'Otherwise,
we may get exposed due to her.'
Can you see this pile of coins?
If I remove one coin
from the top
the pile will still stand firm.
But if I remove
one coin from between
the entire pile
will collapse within a second.
This means, a small and easy effort
proves to be dangerous at times.
It is important to hurt
the weakness of the enemy.
My ethics..
Your destiny.
We have a new maid in the palace.
She repeatedly questioned me
about Chandragupta.
This certainly means trouble.
We will send their dead
bodies to the backyard garden
of your palace before
tomorrow's sunset.

I get curious by
looking at this servant.
Who is he? Where did he come from?
And, how did he secure
such high position this early?
What do you know about Arjun Akhetak?
I do not know anything.
Besides,
I concentrate more on my tasks.
Likewise, I have to
leave now to finish my task.
Of course.
I was merely asking
because I have never seen a young boy
with such skills.
'I have to inform everyone at once'
'that Durgeshwari was trying to secure
information about Chandragupta.'
'Mother?'
'Why is she calling me?'
'She must have something
important to tell me.'
Then, for the entire week
my father made punished
me the entire week.
Your father must have never imagined
that in spite of his numerous attempts
you would be cleaning
stables at the royal palace.
Now, what can I say, friend?
Not everyone is as
lucky as Arjun Akhetak.
What is it?
Do you know him?
No!
He is the maid of the chief's son.
While I am a slave of the horses.
H-how can I possibly know him?
So, you do know him?
N-no!
B-but in general, yes.
I merely know
about him.
I do not know him.
Come, friend.
We have a lot of work to do.
W-we have to clean the stables.
You proceed with your work.
Let me throw the garbage.
Okay.
There is something
about Arjun Akhetak
which they all are trying to hide.
But these fools are unaware
that the truth will
not be hidden for too long.
You are always so busy.
Running from pillar to post.
Hold on.
You have such a tender bodice.
Your fate
is not going to shine
by cleaning utensils.
Do you understand?
If you cross your limits again
then this will be pierced
through your body.
Stay away from me.
She is certainly no ordinary maid.
Ashwasen
the servant at the stable
gave an unusual answer to my question.
As if he was hiding
something about Arjun.
Ashwasen is not the only one, brother.
Even Durgeshwari who is a maid here
became very worried when
I asked her about Arjun.
This means both of them
certainly have some sort
of relation with Arjun Akhetak.
We have to find out the
truth about their relation.
Without wasting time.
If Arjun is indeed Chandragupta
then he and his allies must have
come to the palace quite recently.
We have to enquire about everyone
who has been appointed
at the palace recently.
And, if he is among
the newly appointed
then our suspicion will grow stronger.
I have a plan.
Queen.
Mother, why did you
summon everyone here?
Is everything all right? Are you hurt?
Are you all right?
Yes.
I am fine.
All right, Mother.
If you say so.
I trust you would tell me
if something is wrong.
By the way why did you call us here?
Right. We have
a new maid in the palace.
She repeatedly questioned
me about Chandragupta.
What?
I met a servant today at the stables
he too questioned me
a lot about Chandragupta.
We have two individuals
who want to know about him.
This certainly means trouble.
It is close to us.
Very close.
We must act upon it very soon.
It is the bell that tells us
of approaching trouble.
Something serious has occurred surely.
We must get to our stations at once
before the chief.
Or we might arouse suspicion.
Go.
The criminal will not be forgiven.
He will be punished.
I am getting a feeling
that there are many in this palace
who are not
what they seem to be.
Someone in this palace
have stolen the royal seal
of the district administrator.
I should remind you
that is no ordinary seal.
The emperor's orders
and financial affairs
can only be sanctioned
by the district administrator.
If the seal falls into the wrong hands
it could spell disaster.
Be warned! Whoever stole it
will be caught very soon.
Prior to this day never has anything
like this occurred in this palace.
That is why, I am compelled
to suspect all the new recruits.
Those who were recruited
after last week please come forward.
Commander!
I personally recruited you
but you too are not free
of the suspect category.
If anyone among you is
connected to the theft in any way
then this is the time
to come forward and accept it.
Wait.
There is a maid missing.
She was recruited last week as well.
I am talking about Gattri's sister.
She is the one absent among us.
Go at once and capture her.
There is no need for that.
I found the seal among
my sister Kajri's belonging
while cleaning the maids chamber.
She possibly left it behind
in a hurry to escape.
I request you, my Lord
that she be apprehended
soon and punished.
Her crime cannot be tolerated.
Then honour is more
important to you than family.
I need people like you in my service.
I am fortunate to be
able to serve you, my Lord.
'So, this was a scheme'
'to find out who
were the new recruits.'
'I see, now they suspect us.'
'Since they have learned our truth'
'it's only a matter of time
before Dhananand finds out.'
Arjun.
Chandragupta.
Durgeshwari!
His mother, Mura.
- Dhakannapet!
- Acharya Chanakya!
- Sage Mauni.
- Stulbhadra.
- Ashwasen!
- He's Indrajanik.
They are the five people
who together attacked the emperor!
We can send this message
to emperor Dhananand
that our targets have been found.
So, I have finally got
a message from my secret agents
Dahak and Nishumba.
The robbery of royal seal
is a well-planned conspiracy
to reveal our identity.
I was right with my doubt,
Chandragupta.
Those two who planned this conspiracy
are not some ordinary servants.
They are Dhananand's secret assassins.
But the question is when
they have got to know our truth
why didn't they inform
this to Jagatjala?
This simply implies one thing.
They want to make us captive
- themselves.
- True.
Acharya
if we face them openly
and try to kill them
everyone else including Jagatjala
will get to know our true identity.
Absolutely.
That's why, we should
be defeating them deceitfully
and not vigorously.
Before they create
some new problem for us
we should get rid of them.
I will make a plan to get rid of them.
In the meanwhile,
alert Stulbhadra and the rest of them.
And stay alert.
Go.
Before they both escape from us
we should do something very soon.
But who shall we target first?
Their weakest link.
Emperor Dhananand
we are very happy to inform you
that we are quite close to our target.
Not just Chandragupta
Mura, Chanakya, Stulbhadra, Indra
we are keeping a close
watch on all of them.
We will send their dead bodies
to the backyard garden of your palace
before tomorrow's sunset.
Because catching
them alive can be risky.
Wonderful!
After very long
- I have got some good news.
- I am sorry, Emperor.
But if Dahak and Nishumba know
where Chandragupta and the devious
Chanakya are hiding with their army
why didn't they inform
us in this letter?
What could be the reason, Emperor?
Amatya, because they are
equally impressed with the money
as much as I am.
It's just them who will have the right
over the amount they will be rewarded
for fulfilling their aim.
That is why they do not want
anybody's help in this task.
And it does not make any difference
as to where Chandragupta is.
Me and my sister, Durdhara
just want Chandragupta's dead body.
Right, Durdhara?
Yes, Brother.
Servant, you have taken a huge step.
But King Dhananand cuts
the feather of every bird
which tries to fly
more than its limit.
The same thing will happen to you,
Chandragupta.
I welcome all of you.
People, all of you have witnessed
the talent of my son, Martand
few days ago in the
mighty warrior competition.
Today, the reason behind
inviting all of you
is I want to tell everyone
that my son is not just talented
but he is destined to become the chief
of Paraspura and other places.
A great and renowned
sage had predicted this future
and he has stayed in
this palace on my request.
I am very happy here.
Paraspura's hospitality is amazing.
Tasty food..
Beautiful clothes..
Life is beautiful here.
Greetings, Sage.
The chief has sent this
special offertory for you
before you arrive in the council.
Please have this.
'Why are you requesting?'
'I can eat such tasty
offertory the whole day.'
Servant!
Servant, I found you.
Where had you been?
What happened, Prince Martand?
My father has called
the chiefs of 40 villages
under his realm to
announce his successor
and I am worried
that he may give me
a tougher challenge
to prove my capability before them.
So, you will be with
me till the meeting ends.
And guide me.
I am sorry. Let me go.
I need to be present
somewhere else now.
- I am sorry, Prince.
- Stop!
You are my servant.
You cannot go anywhere.
You will have to be with me.
'How do I alert
Stulbhadra and the others'
'about the assassins
present in the palace?'
'It is your turn now. Chandragupta.'
We need to work hard
to get cold and sweet
water from the well.
We have to put in lot of efforts.
That is when we will
get the cold water.
And more deeper the well,
more sweeter the water will be.
Similarly, in the life of human beings
if he wants to reach his goal
the more stronger and
continuous the efforts are
the result will be much better.
My ethics..
Your destiny.
This smoke..
Chandragupta, time has come to
be present in front of king Dhananand.

================================================================================

Episode: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OV-4CZ7u6Sw

Durgeshwari.
Go, call the sage to the court.
I want my guests
to meet that great sage
who has foreseen
my son's bright future.
You are well versed in using weapons.
But I am more capable
than you in many other things.
And today, I have come here
to show you my power
and your actual place.
Do you see these maids?
Do you see these maids?
Even they had gone against me.
But they had to bow down to me.
And today..
My name is Durgamdaga.
I know how to make my
enemies and egoistic women
and egoistic women bow to me.
One day, even you will.
Very soon.
This is my promise.
Sage.
Sage.
Sage..
'Where did Stulbhadra go?'
You know my son, Martand, very well.
But today,
I want to present him before you
as my heir.
Chief, we all respect your emotions.
But where is that sage
who was going to tell
us Martand's future?
We are waiting to hear from him.
The sage is not in his room.
Is he not there? Then where did he go?
'Why do I feel that
he is in some trouble?'
'I must find him..'
Where are you going?
I am going to find the sage.
But we have enough people to do that.
You are not going anywhere.
You will stay here with me.
Chief, where is the sage?
He is busy in his meditation.
He will be here in some time.
Until then, you can enjoy the snacks.
And yes.
Meanwhile, my brave son, Martand
will tell you his stories of bravery.
Listen.
You will not leave me alone
until we finish this meeting.
Okay?
'Where could Stulbhadra be?'
Hey, stop!
What's there in this bag?
This is a rice bag.
It has caught many rats.
If we don't throw
this out of the palace
they will spread everywhere here.
You can check this if you want to.
But remember, you should
face the chief caretaker then.
All right. You may go.
Everyone is here.
Where did the sage go?
And where is my political advisor,
Lakhanapit?
He should have been here with me now.
Where is he!
'I was cleaning the room of the maids'
'where I found this seal
from my sister, Kajri's bag.'
'That servant had introduced
herself as the sister of Kajri.'
'I must find Kajri's house soon.'
'As per the other maids
this is where she lives.'
Listen.
Where's the house of Kajri?
This is where her house is.
But she is not here.
What do you mean?
Kajri and her husband
are missing since two days.
She has never missed her
duty even for a single day.
But look, today she has
left her door open and left.
Not just her.
There's another servant named Agjiyu.
Even he is missing along
with his family since two days.
'Agjiv was the other servant'
'who had come there
posing as her brother.'
'I am sure it is them
behind whatever happened here.'
'I must find out about them soon.'
Who saw them for the last time?
I saw him going towards that forest.
'He went towards the forest.'
'I must go there soon.'
Brother, I searched for
your political advisor, Lakhanapit
everywhere in the palace, but in vain.
Nobody has seen him from a long time.
What is wrong here?
'Chandragupta is stuck with Martand'
'Stulbhadra is missing
and even Chanakya is not here.'
'I must inform this to Indra.'
'He must be knowing
where Stulbhadra has gone.'
The bad omen..
But the king..
'The murderers are
posing a threat to us.'
'To keep an eye on them'
'I have to get out of this place.'
Councillors..
I regret to inform
for some reason my father
will not be able
to attend this meeting.
By the time he returns
if any one of you
have anything to discuss
then I will be glad
to address the concern.
Martand, discussion is only held
if the person is worthy
of holding a meeting.
None of us are interested
in discussing anything with you.
The councillor have invited us here
so that through Mouni Baba's your
astrological prediction can be heard.
But it seems that he ran away
because of his predictions.
Councillor.
Before insulting Sire Martand
you should know
that insulting and ridiculing
someone are of no use.
Even if you do not
wish but in the future
the new councillor of Paraspura
and the new person-in-charge
for all of you
will be none other than
our very own young lord..
Sire Martand.
And if you all want
that after you your sons
take over your positions
then this would be right for you
that you will not mess
around with Sire Martand.
If everybody had
enjoyed the refreshment
then I would request you to leave.
You are amazing!
What..
Why are everybody leaving so fast?
Ashwasen.
Ashwasen..
'One person is already missing..'
'Now even Indra is not here.'
'I have to alert
Chandragupta immediately.'
Lady, are you okay?
Say something.
Who did this to you? Tell me.
Try to be silent, imbeciles!
Welcome..
Welcome to the jaws of death!
As soon as this rope crosses the mark
your body will split in two halves.
And then,
you all will die a painful death.
Tomorrow, at the crack of dawn
we will gift your dead
bodies to King Dhananand.
It will be a moment of glory
when along with your dead bodies
the dead body of Chandragupta
will also be with yours.
Go and get him.
My servants cannot
leave my palace without
my permission.
What is going on?
Husband..
Husband,
something strange is going on.
My servant, Durgeshwari,
whom you had sent to bring Moni Baba
she has gone missing.
She is not in the palace.
- What?
- Father.
My servants,
Arjun Akhetak, are also missing.
Moni Baba,
Arjun, Durgeshwari and Lakha!
Where have all of them gone missing?
Something strange is going on.
I have to get to root of this.
Arrange me a horse, right now!
I have searched the entire forest.
But I have not found Kajari and Agjiv.
Where could have they gone?
How come these worms are here?
They only consume spoiled meat.
I do not see carcass
of any animal here.
Then these..
I hope the murderers
have not done anything
bad to Agjiv and Kajri.
I will get answers to my questions
only by following the worms.
'I hope Acharya is
not too late to return.'
Why did you take so
much time to get my horse!
Forgive me, sir.
I do not understand what is going on.
Both Ashwasen and
your horse are missing.
That is it! This is too much!
This is some sort of
betrayal or a conspiracy.
Close all the gates of the palace
and find out about all who is missing.
Brother
the servants which
replaced Agjiv and Kajri
have gone missing from the palace.
New servants disappearing
from the palace
cannot be a coincidence.
There is surely
a conspiracy behind this.
We have to find all of them somehow.
- Sire..
- What happened now?
I saw sister of Kajari
and Agjiv's brother
the new servants going towards
the forest in the north direction.
All of them are definitely connected.
Alert the army and order
them to search in the forest.
Surround the forest!
I will find out what
is going on in person.
As you say, Brother.
They are not ordinary murderers.
Along with Kajri and Agjiv
their family was also killed.
These killers are
more dangerous than I estimated.
'I have to get to
Chandragupta quickly.'
If I ask you to choose
between the axe and the sword
to cut an apple, what will you choose?
Surely you will choose the axe.
It is because it would be of no use
to a sword for a normal task.
Similarly, using more power
than necessary is of no use
in the life.
Keep this in mind.
On some fronts,
using more power than necessary
can ensure your victory.
But it can also cripple
you in other fronts.
Being strong is good and advantageous.
But preserving the power
is smart.
My ethics..
Your destiny.
The one you are
considering your servant
is the Prince of Piplivan,
Chandragupta
and the greatest enemy of Magadh.
'Your and Magadh's most dangerous
enemy, Chandragupta Maurya'
'has been captured in Paraspura.'

================================================================================

Episode: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrDHInrADBg

Stop!
Stop!
What is happening here!
Soldiers, imprison them!
Be careful, District Chief!
Before doing anything, do remember
that you are pointing these swords
towards the loyal servants
of the king and not us.
It means you are pointing
these swords towards the king.
What? Loyal servants of the king?
Does it mean King Dhananand?
Perhaps, you are forgetting
that we have only one king.
King Dhananand can never
get my servants attacked.
He is aware of my loyalty and honesty.
That is why do not
even try to deceive me.
Reveal your identity
and tell me why you were
trying to kill my servants.
These deceivers are not your servants.
They are the biggest
traitors of Magadh.
King Dhananand has been
looking for these traitors.
District Chief, the one
you are considering your servant
is Chandragupta!
Chandragupta?
Yes. Your son's favourite servant
Arjun Akhetak,
is the Prince of Piplivan
and the greatest enemy of Magadh.
He revolted against King Dhananand!
And the one with him,
the maid, Durgeshwari
is Chandragupta's mother,
Piplivan's queen Mura!
And these two are his best friends,
Stulbhadra and Indra.
And who am I in your drama?
Acharya Vishnugupta Chanakya?
"He is Chanakya.."
"He is Chanakya.."
"He is Chanakya.."
"He is Chanakya.."
Greetings, my Lord.
Yes.. You did not tell me.
Whose role am I playing in your drama?
Am I playing
Acharya Vishnugupta Chanakya?
- Yes! You are that cunning Brahmin..
- Yes! You are that cunning Brahmin..
All these conspiracies and revolt
were instigated by you, Chanakya!
You are the one who helped
this traitor, Chandragupta
against King Dhananand at every step.
You have guided him.
Great! These two tell great stories.
Are you storytellers? Liars!
Our master used his
sensibility and intelligence
and came here on time.
Otherwise, you two murderers
would have killed
these innocent people.
Lord, I request you
to give me some time.
I will explain the
cycle of events to you.
But I have a request.
Until I explain the matter to you
please release these innocent people.
Once I explain the
circumstances to you
you will come to know the
traitors from the innocents.
No, Your Highness.
It will be your biggest
mistake to release them.
Enough!
You have spoken enough!
Now, I will decide
who shall be punished
and who should not be punished.
I will learn the root of the problem
and find the truth.
Soldiers! Why are you standing idly?
Release them!
No, Your Highness!
Do not release them! Please stop.
Are you defying my master's orders?
Why do you want to die so soon,
you fool?
Now, stay quiet..
What did the master say?
You will stay quiet and
I will put my thoughts forth.
My Lord, I apologise to you.
The time you needed me the most
I was not with you.
But when I tell you
the reason for my absence
you will understand
that my absence was needed.
What do you want to say, Lakha?
My Lord, I want to say
that you were deceived and betrayed
by the one, who betrayed
King Dhananand, the greatest Naapit.
He! He is that betrayer!
"He is Chanakya.."
And, my Lord
he is none other than
the son of Piplivan's late king
Chandravardhan Maurya,
Chandragupta Maurya!
The cunning girl standing beside him..
His aide.. She is Paraspura
and Magadh's dangerous enemy.
This is a lie!
This cunning Brahmin is lying!
Your Highness,
neither am I Chandragupta
nor is she Chandragupta's aide!
As I have told you earlier
we are here on the king's orders.
How shall I accept
that King Dhananand has sent you here?
Because I have proof, Your Highness.
King Dhananand sent
this message to us.
We are trained assassins
who were hired by the king.
We were personally
appointed by the king
to find Chandragupta and
his accomplices and kill them.
Your Highness, please note
it clearly states
that King Dhananand
sent us to Village Bandhi.
He knew that Chandragupta
would be there!
But as soon as we reached there
we came to know that they had escaped.
What do you wish to
say about this, Lakha?
This letter was sent
by King Dhananand.
Look at it.
This letter bears the royal seal.
What would I do by looking at it,
my Lord?
It would be the king's royal seal.
But what is so special about it?
They are thieves! Do you not remember
that they had stolen
your royal seal too?
So, when they can steal
the royal seal from your mansion
then it is not tough for them to steal
the same from King Dhananand's palace.
What do you mean?
My Lord, their conspiracy had started
when they stole your royal seal.
No. Her sister,
Kajri, had stolen the royal seal.
She said that.
She was saying that
to gain your confidence
and trust.
But they forgot that
your trusted servants
the ones who would sacrifice
their lives for you
were still in the mansion.
For example, that maid..
Tell them, dear..
Tell the master what you
saw without any hesitation or fear.
No one will reprimand you.
I apologise, Your Highness.
I had seen this maid
stealing your royal seal
but I did not say anything to anyone
as I was scared to be suspected by you
and being fired from work.
Forgive me, my Lord..
My Lord, this was the first
stage of their cunning plan.
They killed your trusted
maid and servant.
Go and bring them.
My Lord, look here.
These are the dead bodies
of your loyal servant,
Agjiyu, and your wife's maid, Kajri.
These two are so cruel
that they not only killed them
but they killed their
family members as well.
They killed them to
gain their identity marks
so that they could enter your
mansion take shelter and stay hidden.
But where did you
find these dead bodies?
This means you killed them!
- But I had reason to do it.
- I will tell you the reason.
They killed them
because they wanted to steal
the marks to enter your mansion.
They accomplished that.
The second stage of their plan
was to bring chaos into your palace.
This time,
they targeted those maids and servants
who were newly appointed.
They wanted to blame them
for anything that went wrong
and save themselves.
That is why they chose your son,
Martand's loyal
and ardent servant, Arjun Akhetak.
They blamed your wife's
trusted maid Durgeshwari.
Moreover,
they did not even spare Sage Mouni.
You were going to use his help
to gain the trust of
all the chiefs in your region.
And Ashwasen
who is an expert in
controlling your horses.
My Lord, I have always aspired
to serve Lord Martand
with loyalty and honesty
and to see him becoming
a great ruler as his fate dictates.
My Lord, he told me
that I am helping the future
ruler of Paraspura in becoming strong.
Father, I do not suspect Arjun.
I trust him implicitly.
He cannot conspire against us.
Sage Mouni wants to say something.
He is saying that if he had prophesied
in front of all the chiefs of your region
that your son, Martand, would be a capable
future ruler of Paraspura
your position amongst
them would have strengthened.
But they..
They are the enemies
of Magadh and Paraspura.
They want to sow the
seeds of discord here.
Why would they let it happen?
That is why they imprisoned
the sage as well.
Yes, they could not digest
my loyalty towards Lady Kalki.
From the time I came here
I have been alert towards
Lady Kalki's security.
That is why they imprisoned me.
This is true, dear.
From the time she came
here she has always helped me.
That is why I was
worried about her absence
and I immediately informed you.
Chief Jagatjala, please listen to me.
I am Dahak and she is my sister,
Nishumbha.
We were here at
King Dhananand's behest
to find and kill Chandragupta.
We were accomplishing our task
when you suddenly became
an obstacle in our way.
Are you blaming the master?
My Lord, he should
be killed just for this.
But not now. I will prove him guilty.
I will ask him only one question.
If according to his words
they were sent by the great Napit,
King Dhananand
for accomplishing an important task
then why did they not
come to the master directly?
Why did they not say
that they have been
sent by King Dhananand
to accomplish an important task?
You would have welcomed them.
You would have given them the
resources to accomplish their task.
But, no. They did not do that.
They came here stealthily like thieves
and entered your mansion.
They killed your trusted
maid and servant.
How can he kill Chandragupta?
He is Chandragupta!
My Lord, let me tell you
the most significant thing.
This is not the first time
he is doing this.
He had lived as a servant
at King Dhananand's palace.
He is doing the same here.
He is doing it
because he wants to weaken
your mansion from within.
He is lying. This is untrue.
He is not a Napit.
He is the cunning Chanakya.
I knew that you would
say this about me.
That is why I introduced
myself as Chanakya when I came here.
My Lord, think about it.
I am an ordinary Napit
and he is a Brahmin.
But I do not speak without evidence.
I always have evidence.
My Lord, I have a piece of
incriminating evidence against them.
If you do not believe me
even for a moment
then the one whom you
trust the most after yourself
will present this evidence.
Your younger brother, Lord Durgam.
Brother, Lakha, the barber
is telling the truth.
I found the mark
of Piplivan and the flag
of the Maurya dynasty
from Nishumbha and his room.
Your Highness,
they do not belong to us.
They are conspiring against us!
You had conspired, murderers!
But the things that are evident,
do not need evidence.
And these proofs are against you!
My Lord, I just want to say
they not only conspired
against Paraspura
but they conspired against Magadh.
They tried to spread chaos
in your region.
They have killed your
trusted servant and maid.
I request you to
sentence them to death!
Chief! This cunning Brahmin is lying!
Keep quiet!
You, Chandragupta Maurya
Prince of Piplivan
are a traitor.
Not only in Paraspura
but you have terrorised entire Magadh.
You are the reason
of King Dhananand's worry.
I, his loyal and trusted chief
will fulfill my duty towards his
protection and the state's welfare.
As the punishment of being a traitor
and trying to kill my servants
I sentence you to death!
An eye for an eye!
Imprison them!
Give them the same cruel death
that they were trying
to give my servants.
Take them away!
Kill them!
Stop, Your Highness!
You are making a mistake!
I know that this is my end.
But do remember that
no one lies before dying.
Arjun is Chandragupta.
This is the truth.
Brother, remember
that you should never
stop while delivering justice.
Send the message to King Dhananand
that his greatest enemy
Piplivan's prince,
Chandragupta Maurya is no more.
Do you know the speciality
of this ordinary toy?
This air-driven machine..
Child..
It moves in the direction of air flow.
But if you try to use it
against the flow of air
it will break.
It means either become so strong
that you can stand
against the air flow
or become intelligent enough
to understand the
changing directions of air
and move with it's flow.
There are two shields of protection.
Either brains or brawn.
Either become strong to face
the enemy's challenge and win
or use your intelligence
to turn the situation in your favour.
My ethics..
Your destiny.
'Magadh's most dangerous enemy,
Chandragupta Maurya'
'has been killed in Paraspura'
We have to leave to
Paraspura immediately.

================================================================================

Episode: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBJnDHBIU1Y

I'm so desperate that every
minute is making me anxious.
I am waiting anxiously for sunset.
I'm waiting for Nishumba and Dahak
to present me Chanakya
and Chandragupta's corpses.
I'll leave for Lal Bagh, right away.
By the time I return from Lal Bagh
I will get their dead bodies
along with me.
I'm waiting to see
my sister's smile at that time.
Glory to the Emperor.
Paraspura's regional chief,
Jagatjala has sent
an important message to you.
I am waiting anxiously
to see Chandragupta's dead body
but you are here with some message.
Is this message more important
than my happiness, Bhadrasal?
I request you to
go through the message
before you leave for Lal Bagh.
Grandma, have you ever
seen Bhadrasal so happy?
Today he is insisting me.
A loyal soldier's happiness
is in unison with his Emperor.
Bhadrasaal's happiness
may be linked to you.
So go ahead and permit him
to convey the message, Emperor.
I permit, if it is so.
Go ahead, read it.
'Respectful Emperor!'
'Accept your loyal servant,
Jagatjala's greetings.'
'I am extremely happy to inform you'
'that your and Magadh's most
dangerous enemy, Chandragupta Maurya'
'has been killed in Paraspura.'
'His accomplice has also been killed.'
'Unless you don't come to
Paraspura and satisfy yourself'
'that your enemy is dead, I will
preserve their corpse till then.'
'Congratulations, Emperor.'
'Chandragupta and his accomplice'
'Magadh's dangerous
enemies are dead now.'
'Hail to Magadh's Emperor, Dhananand!'
He is dead! He is no more!
This is the best news
you have ever delivered to me.
Chandragupta is dead!
His accomplice, which means the cunning,
Chanakya has also been killed.
Emperor!
I beg your pardon.
I am unable to understand one thing.
How was Jagatjala able to find Chanakya
and Chandragupta in Paraspura?
How could he kill them so easily?
How, My Emperor?
What about Dahak and Nishumba?
We had assigned this task to them.
As per their message,
these two were to send
Chanakya, Chandragupta and
their other accomplices' corpses
to Lal Bagh.
Hope you remember it, Emperor!
Amatya, when some good news arrives
there's no need to analyse
and get into the details, instead
it should be enjoyed.
Letter!
Look at this.
Look, Amatya.
This is Jagatjala's royal seal.
I trust Jagatjala more
than any other regional chief.
If Jagatjala has sent this message
it's clear that the useless
servant and the cunning Chanakya
have been killed.
We have to leave to
Paraspura immediately.
I am anxious to see their dead bodies.
'Why am I feeling'
'that there is a hidden truth
behind this message'
'which we are unable to see now.'
This was the only way we could escape
Dhananand and Jagatjala's suspicion.
It means that you knew
Dahak and Nishumba may abduct us.
Yes!
At Bandhi village, when Chandragupta
was attacked from a vague direction
I understood that they
are not ordinary assassins
but extremely skilled
and dangerous assassins.
I started planning
since that point in time.
When the royal seal
was stolen in the palace
Chanakya's suspicion
turned into confirmation that
Dahak and Nishumba are
those assassins appointed
by Dhananand to kill us.
That's when I and Chanakya
made this plan.
Which plan?
We allowed them to abduct you.
So that they could be
happy in their false victory
and become careless.
When they were busy in abducting you
I utilised that time and
gathered evidence against them
which could prove them
guilty in front of Jagatjala.
Then I told the maid to
inform Jagatjala immediately
that she saw those two
assassins going into the forest.
'Few minutes ago, I saw Kajri's
sister and Agjiv's brother'
'the newly appointed maid
and servant venturing'
'into the forest,
in the north direction.'
As soon as Jagatjala
proceeded to the forest
I took Durgam to Dahak
and Nishumba's unit
I had hidden Piplivan's emblem
and flag over there.
So that they could be mistaken
for Piplivan's soldiers.
'Lakhanapit, if you were
not my brother's trustworthy'
'I wouldn't have been doing this'
'nor would I have
suspected my servants.'
'Mauryan flag?
Piplivan?'
'Lakhanapit this is Piplivan's emblem'
'and this is Mauryan flag!'
One last question, Chanakya.
How did you figure out where
those assassins have kept us?
Through Chandragupta.
He facilitated his
abduction purposely.
So that he could find out
their secret location's directions.
When those assassins were
taking me to their secret place
I was dropping peacock
feathers on the way.
Acharya Chanakya followed
it and reached there.
Stulbhadra, nobody is here.
You can talk.
Acharya, the plan was good as always.
Chandragupta and you
always save us from trouble.
But I have a complain with you.
Forget it, Stulbhadra.
No, Chandra. No.
I am scared.
But I will say this today.
Nobody else tells him anything.
Stulbhadra, your complain is
why I never fall in
trouble in any plan of mine.
Did you hear that?
This is not fair, Acharya.
People like us cannot
even complain now
because even before we say anything
he understands our complains too.
You are great, Acharya.
You are great.
The problem has been solved now.
But we will have to be alert
because Dhananand will not
accept the death of his biggest enemy.
He himself will come
to Paraspura very soon
to confirm this truth.
Durdhara.
Come with me, Durdhara.
See this good news from your eyes.
No, Brother.
I will not come with you.
I will stay here.
I want to express my happiness
through my paintings.
I will do that till you return.
Enjoy seeing the dead body till then.
Good.
When I return
I will explain everything in detail.
And you
show me your painting.
Amatya, we should leave immediately.
Your wish is my command, Your Majesty.
Finally, the traitor,
Chandragupta, has been killed.
Where is everyone?
Why have they not returned yet?
'I know that this is my end.'
'But nobody lies during
their last moments.'
'Arjun is Chandragupta.'
'This is the truth.'
Sometimes, I do not understand
your behaviour, Durgam.
I have killed Chandragupta,
the traitor of Magadh
and the biggest enemy of Dhananand.
I have killed the person
who could not be killed
by Asaka and Magadh's armies.
Don't you realise
that this is a big achievement for us?
King Dhananand may get impressed by me
and give me the leadership
of 40 more villages.
But you are not happy
with this achievement of mine.
I have not seen
a happy smile on your face
ever since I have killed
Chandragupta and his friend.
Tell me, what is the
reason behind this grief?
Tell me, Durgam. Tell me.
I have called of you here
to give you a good news.
King Dhananand is coming
to Paraspura very soon.
And he will reach
our palace very soon.
Is this true?
Is King Dhananand arriving here?
Yes, I know that
all of you are excited.
But we will have to make arrangements
for his welcome.
He is Dhananand,
the great king of Magadh.
We will have to come
him as per his standard.
Decorate all the paths
of the village with rose petals.
He should be given a perfect welcome.
And you, Durgam, make Chandragupta
and his friend's bodies ready so
that King Dhananand can identify them.
Let the king see that I have
killed his biggest enemy.
As you say, Brother.
Remember one thing.
None of us will cross
Dhananand's path.
Spread in different directions
wherever possible.
Stay away from him.
Inform the others too.
'Brother, you may not
suspect the five of them.'
'But I will always have an eye on you'
'till I expose the five of you'
'in front of everyone.'
'My name is Durgam Daga.'
'I am happy to tell you that
Magadh and your biggest enemy'
'Chandragupta Maurya,
has been killed in Paraspura.'
'Have you forgotten your duties?'
'At this moment,
there are some people'
'who need me more than you.'
'It is my duty to protect them.'
Durdhara.
The arrangements
should be done properly!
Get more flowers.
Spread the perfumes.
Remember that today
I am going to present you
in front of the emperor
as the prospective councilor.
You should show confidence
and dress appropriately!
Where can Kalki be?
She is always unavailable
when she is needed the most.
Durgeshwari, you know that
the councilor is very much engrossed
and looking forward to
the welcoming of the emperor.
If.. If I commit any mistake, then..
Listen. You have to accompany me.
But lady, I am not a part
of the welcoming ceremony.
I have no experience in it.
But lady..
You have so many handmaidens
who are experienced
and have the expertise
who can help you.
But I trust only you.
You have to accompany me.
Come.
For whom are you waiting for?
Any moment King Dhananand
will be coming near the gates.
Let us go.
Such a dilemma!
I cannot even disobey Kalki
and at the same time
I have to avoid a face-off
with that wicked Dhananand.
Welcome, Emperor!
It is my honour and gratitude to
have the presence of Your Excellency
in the land of Paraspura!
It is an honour for the
entire people of Paraspura!
You have made your
presence felt at the time
when the entire Paraspura
is celebrating 'Navratri'.
It is the blessings of Goddess Durga
that I am honoured
to present you the gift
which you are eagerly waiting for.
I have killed Chandragupta Maurya
who is the arch enemy
of the mighty King Dhananand.
That imbecile made an effort
to give result to his conspiracies
but he did not have
that weapon which I have.
And that is, your trust in me.
At the end,
his betrayal gave way to my trust.
Wait, Councilor!
You very well know
that I like to hear praises
and effort all day long.
I will listen to your brave efforts
in the comfort of my chamber.
As of now,
I want to see the dead bodies
of Chandragupta and his accomplice.
Of course, Your Highness.
Have you ever seen
an animal hunting a prey?
The success or an
unsuccessful feat of a hunter
is based an important reason.
Sudden attack.
If a prey gets an inkling
that the hunter has
gained focus on him
and he is waiting to hunt him down
then he will be
successful in escaping.
This principle is
also based in our life
when we come to know that the attacker
is waiting to hunt us down
and if his move
is an accidental one
or if our enemy has already
come to know about it.
Remember
even if your plans are fool-proof
but if your enemy
comes to know about it
then success will
never touch your feet.
My ethics..
Your destiny.
You mistook my secret assassins
as Chandragupta and his accomplice.
I was provided evidence to prove it.
Who is it?
My political advisor, Lakhanapit..
Present him before me.

================================================================================

Episode: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HEkKH4cnfT4

Jagatjala, you know it
very well that I love to hear
my praise and expression
of devotion towards me.
I will leisurely listen
to stories of your courage.
But now, I would like to see
the dead bodies of Chandragupta
and his accomplice.
Sure, My Majesty!
Please come, My Majesty!
Let me take you over there.
Please come.
What kind of an Emperor is he?
Why is he so excited
to see the dead bodies?
He is an extremely cruel
and unjust emperor.
Promise me, My Lord
that you won't be
like him at any cost.
The fragrance of death!
This fragrance is amazing, Jagatjala.
No, Dear Friend! Never!
I can't be like him at any cost.
I am anxious.
Come on, hurry up, let me view them.
Where are those dead bodies?
Just a minute, My Majesty.
Kindly bless my son, Martand.
Son?
I had just heard about you
but today I got to meet you in person.
Pardon me, Jagatjala
but your son's personality
doesn't reflect the qualities.
Luckily he is just the
son of a Regional Head and
not the son of an Emperor.
Otherwise nobody would have
accepted his kingship.
Present the corpses before me.
Here they are..
Corpses! The corpses
I've been waiting to see!
Open them quickly.
What is all this, Jagatjala?
My Majesty, what are you up to?
I killed your most
wanted enemy and you..
Either you are very foolish
or a very brave traitor.
Don't you value your life that you
called me here to gift me this.
My Majesty!
Get up..
I am unable to understand, My Majesty
as to what is my mistake that
you are so angry with me.
Not just a mistake,
you've committed a crime.
As you mistook my secret assassins
Dahak and Nishumba
as Chandragupta and his accomplice.
'Nobody lies at the last moments.'
'Arjun is Chandragupta.'
I was told that he is Chandragupta.
I was provided evidence to prove it.
Keep quiet!
Jagatjala, you valued the evidence
more than your vision
and your intelligence.
I, myself had clearly mentioned
to you that Chandragupta
is an adolescent between
15-18 years of age.
Do you think this person
is an adolescent?
Tell me what do you think his age is?
Answer me.
'Emperor's servant,
Chandragupta is only'
'about 16-17 years old but
is an expert in conning people.'
How could I forget such
an important information.
What had happened to me?
How did I forget that
Chandragupta is just
a 16-17 years old youth?
Please forgive me, My Majesty.
I was blinded to receive
your accolade and was in a hurry
to kill Chandragupta such that
I trusted the evidence
and alimony against them as true
and acted upon those.
I forgot that Chandragupta
is an adolescent.
Evidence!
Who dared to prove
Dahak as Chandragupta?
Who is it
who falsely proved
the assassins sent by me?
My political advisor, Lakhanapit..
Durgam.
My brother Durgam has got
this evidence from his room.
This gives us a hint about
their relation with Piplivan.
Jagatjala,
did you not think that my murderers
would have gathered these
evidences against Chandragupta?
Who is Lakhanapit?
Present him before me.
I want to meet him now.
Sure, Your Highness!
Wherever Lakhanapit is
he should presented in front
of king Dhananand immediately.
What do we do now, Acharya?
Ever since Dhananand has
said that he wants to meet you
Jagatjala's soldiers
are on a look out for you.
I have a plan, Acharya.
I will be hiding
in the court that time
so that I can take the
advantage of that chance
and attack Dhananand
when you keep him distracted
so that I can kill him
right there.
Anyway, Dhananand does
not deserve to die as a warrior.
You will not do that, Chandragupta.
Because this difficult plan of yours
has less chances
of getting successful.
Do you even know how
many soldiers he has with him?
Around 150.
These 150 soldiers
are those you can see.
But do not forget that
he is the king of Magadh
who always moves
with an invisible army.
He always has his soldiers
safeguarding him in disguise.
Even if they get a hint
that Dhananand is in danger
they will enter the palace
without wasting any time
and turn this into a graveyard.
Go, find Lakhanapit right now!
I want him at any cost.
But what if he has already
escaped from the palace?
He cannot escape.
I had already deployed
500 soldiers at the border
before coming here.
It is impossible that
he will get away from them.
Commander-in-chief Bhadrasal
help the chief and his soldiers
and present that man before
the king as soon as possible.
We do not have more time.
Sure, Amatya.
That servant, Arjun,
is the reason for this whole problem.
I must find an evidence soon
which can prove
that he is actually
the prince of Piplivan
and that, Durgeshwari is his mother
Queen Mura. That is when
I will make Durgeshwari bow to me
as I had challenged her.
You have helped me even
in the most dangerous situations.
Then how can I leave you alone now?
No, Acharya.
I cannot let you
face this danger alone.
I have already told you, Chandragupta.
You will not do anything as such.
Try to understand.
The circumstances are
not in our favour this time.
We must take some hard decisions now.
Remember this.
Even if they kill me before you
you will not reveal
your true identity.
- But, Acharya..
- This is my command.
Greetings, Amatya!
I want to ask you
a very important question.
Go ahead.
Is there a thing which can
help us identify Chandragupta?
Something which can
make us find him soon.
Why?
Do you think you can find him?
We must try.
That is why we are searching
for Lakhanapit together.
Right?
Yes.
There is something
which is very important for him.
It is his mother's bangle.
Chandragupta's mother's bangle.
How to handle Dhananand..
Leave that to me.
Just worry about how
you will escape their eyes.
You just remember this.
If you leave any evidence behind
your truth will be exposed.
You all may go now
and spread in the palace.
Find a place and hide yourself.
I want to go before Dhananand.
No, Acharya.
I cannot make you take
the advantage of being my guru
and sacrifice yourself.
He is not taking the
advantage of being a guru.
He is just giving more
priority to his motherland.
Our motive will be unfulfilled
if you go before him.
He will win
and our motherland will lose again.
Hence
let him go.
Always remember this, Chandragupta.
No matter how difficult
the situation is
and no matter how
many obstacles you face
but you always keep moving forward
for the freedom of your motherland.
Forward and only forward.
"He is Chanakya.."
"He is Chanakya.."
"He is Chanakya.."
"He is Chanakya.."
I want to discuss something
important with you.
Are you understanding?
What has been proved by the death
of the two murderers sent by the king?
If Lakha was lying so far
it proves that Dahak
was telling the truth.
And the four people whom
he was indicating towards
were actually
Chandragupta and his team.
And all of them are my servants.
What do I do now?
What do I do now?
'I will have to stop brother
from telling the truth to the king.'
'Otherwise, my plan may fail.'
Brother, please calm down first.
Calm down.
Don't you remember
what did the king do to you
when you informed the king
that Chandragupta is dead
and it was proved wrong
due to lack of evidences?
If you inform the king
again about Chandragupta
and it gets proved
wrong even this time
the king will give
you a death sentence.
You are right.
So, do not do anything now.
I will do whatever has to be done.
Watch this incident calmly
and your behaviour should be such
as though everything
is all right in this palace.
And nobody has made any mistake.
Everything is under your control
and you are an honest chief
who is helping the king
in finding Chandragupta.
Did you understand, Brother?
Okay.
Your Majesty.
Lakha, the barber, has been found.
And he is going towards the council.
Very good.
Brother,
leave this decision to the king.
Let us see whether
Lakha is really Chanakya or not.
But you watch everything
as a silent observer till then.
Please do not make any mistake.
Is that okay, Brother?
It is okay.
I will destroy the pride and ego
of Durgeshwari now.
You know what, Durgeshwari?
I celebrate the veneration
of 'Chaitra Navaratri'
with a lot of joy and interest.
Amazing.
Unbelievable.
Superb.
There is so much beauty and love here.
It looks like a garden of flowers.
Can't your dearest brother-in-law
break a flower from this garden?
Tell me, Sister-in-law.
This is the flower
that I want to break.
And you are walking away.
Brother-in-law, I..
I need her here.
I have to make arrangements
for the veneration.
Today is the last day of 'Navaratri'
and a lot of work is pending.
You have the maids to do that work.
Make them do this work.
And you do not worry about that.
She knows to protect herself.
Look at this.
A thorn hidden with the flowers.
She is not an ordinary
and innocent maid.
She is a strong woman.
I mean, she is a Kshatriya woman.
'Durgam knows that
I am a Kshatriya woman.'
'If he discloses
my truth to Dhananand'
'all of us will be in trouble.'
Can you see this vessel?
If I have to use this vessel
I need to know its capability.
Similarly,
in the lives of human beings
before trusting or
depending on somebody
we should know what
his capabilities are
what his strengths are
and what are his limitations
because if you trust somebody
without knowing all this
just like this vessel
that human being also
will be useless in your life
and he will let your trust go in vain.
My ethics..
Your destiny.
So you are Lakhanapit..
I do not know why,
I doubt that he is a lowborn.
Even I feel that he is not a lowborn.

================================================================================

Episode: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IASxSlow7U8

She is not an ordinary
and innocent maid.
She is a strong a woman.
One of a warrior clan.
Come with me.
My Lord, Lakhanapit is here.
So you are Lakhanapit.
It is because of you
that two of my assassins
have been killed!
An advisor who has such confidence
does bring forth doubt.
How could you be so certain
that Daahak was Chandragupta?
Sire!
I am mere lowborn.
It was the grace your city steward
who chose me as his advisor.
And thus it was my duty
to keep my lord safe.
And to warn him of
threats that crawl closer
but how could I have
warned him of a threat
that I had not ascertained?
So just as I found
out about the threat
I wanted to investigate further
and hence I followed them
and my doubt strengthened
when I..
When I saw the servants
of my Lord killed!
And then I saw the corpse of Kajri,
your servant!
Sire, it was not just
their bodies lying around
and even their families
were killed in terrible manner.
And I thought only
a sworn enemy of Magadh
can ever kill someone
in such a painful manner
thus it must be
Chandragupta and his party!
Sire, I made a mistake.
I admit I was wrong
but please do not think
of it as a betrayal.
You may kill me if it pleases you
but such an accusation
is like countless deaths to me!
It was an act of ill luck!
That is all!
It all unfolded as
an ill turn of events.
Sire, the signs simply said that
it was Chandragupta!
A turn of events, you say?
Such wise words from a lowborn..
It does seem a little
strange, does it not?
Sire, as I had told you
that this man is exceptionally wise.
He says that being a barber
he is not limited to shaving
as we are all ruled by a great Emperor
who comes from a community of barbers.
Jagatjala,
one must be cautious of the wise.
Since just as he
can stand by the truth
he can also deceive
us all by the same ease.
I do not know
why I doubt that he is a lowborn.
Truly said, Sire.
Even I feel that he is not a lowborn.
There must be a reason
behind this doubt of yours..
I will send a unit of mine
to his village at once
to find out who he is.
Jagatjala, I rule such a vast empire
because I do not trust fools like you!
I will find out
who he is.
One can learn and acquire knowledge
but handling a shaving blade..
It is a skill of great expertise, which
cannot be learned just like that..
We of the barber community
have this gift from birth..
An innate talent.
I will determine if
he is a barber or not.
A lot depends of this truth.
A false identity makes every word said
by a person into nothing but lies!
And if he is not a barber
then every word that he
said here will be termed a lie!
Come now, Lakhanapit.
Bring the razor.
I wish to see
if your blade is as sharp
as tongue.
Come to me.
Everything that you
want to convey to me
please do it right now.
I can express what I have to say here.
But if someone were to hear that
then it will humiliate a Queen.
Am I right, Queen Mura?
Mura?
My name is Durgeshwari.
And if you are done calling me names
then you must allow me
to go to Lady Kalki.
A game!
We will have a game!
This act of yours
is futile against me
as I now know the truth.
Nishumbha was right!
Arjun is Chandragupta.
And he is the Prince of Piplivan!
Chandra, you do remember
that you kept it here, right?
Yes, Indra.
I kept it with the
luggage of Sthulbhadra.
As Jagatjala has stated very clearly
that apart from the nobles,
no one enters this room.
So where is the bracelet?
This is it.
This fear is what I wanted
to see on your face
that makes it evident
that you are Queen Mura.
And this is your bracelet.
Something that your son
treasures deeply.
And I am certain
that the Emperor
will know this bracelet.
If I were to conceal
the truth from the Emperor
that you
are Queen Mura
and Arjun Akhetak
is your son Chandragupta..
And the silent sage is Sthulbhadra..
And Indrajalik is Ashwasen!
And that Lakha is the
cunning priest Chanakya!
And if I wish to conceal this truth
then it will be treason.
And if I were to commit this treason
what will I get from
the Queen as a reward
for saving her son's life?
What will I get from her?
To be honest,
since the moment I saw you
I have felt a strange
attraction towards you.
It could be since you
are no simple handmaiden
but a great Queen!
And I have never
got a chance to be with a Queen!
So give me what I seek
and your son and
his allies will be safe.
Sire, you must have a good reason
to have Lakha work as a barber.
You are right, Jagatjala.
You yourself are from a barber clan
and you know well
that barbers are focused.
And it is a devotion.
When a barber is working
he carries a delicate balance
within his mind and body
and if the mind wavers from
the body the hand can cause a wound.
This will be the test of that Lakha.
I will ask him many
questions as he works
and he must answer
them while attending.
If he truly is a barber
then he will answer naturally
and thus keeping his balance intact.
But if he lies
his hands will falter.
And then either his hands will shiver
or it will stop.
That will prove him guilty..
Then I will use
my dear blade to end him
and his lie.
I am ready, Sire.
So am I, Barber Lakha.
Stop!
Why do you use a blade
of different metal?
Councillor, by the grace of God
today I get to serve
the great Emperor.
I will spare no effort.
I have heard that the Lord
uses a same kind of blade.
Flattery is futile, Lakha.
I will ask you some questions.
That will prove if you are a barber
or not.
If I am not satisfied with your answer
then this will be your last day.
- Name?
- Barber Lakha.
- What tribe?
- Hanani Barber tribe.
- Family name?
- Behri.
- Your bloodline?
- Bhairavi.
- Clan deity?
- Lord Kaalbhairav.
- Sign of your house?
- This knot, Sire.
This is the sign of my people.
- Father's name?
- Bhanta.
- His father?
- Bhagat.
- And his father?
- Jogi.
- Village?
- Jalawadi.
- Native village?
- Darsa.
This is where you failed!
You have fallen in
your own trap, Lakha.
You had said that you
are from Hanani tribe.
But Hanani tribe
never settled in Darsa.
Forgive me, Sire.
I have not lied.
Just as priests call themselves
as descendants of Kaushik
if they do not know their line..
Similarly, if we barbers
do not know our native village
then we must call Darsa
as our native village.
Since the crown jewel
of our community of barbers
that was Mahapadmananda, your father..
And he hailed from Darsa.
You have succeeded.
I am satisfied with your answer.
I believe what you said in the court
and now I am pleased by your answers
so I wish to give you a reward.
Bhadrasaal!
I am indebted to serve you
and if you still wish to reward me
then I beg you
that you give me the
reward by your own hands.
I will feel
that I have been blessed by God.
A god, you say?
You are a true barber.
You know when to speak.
There you go.
'This threat has passed.'
'But we are not safe'
'till Dhananand is here.'
You think
you are no longer in danger?
The peril comes closer.
I have given you a way out.
Durgam, you must know
that within every hour
either my son or his allies
come to see me.
To make certain that I am safe.
And if Chandragupta comes to know
that you have brought me here..
Think over it.
Dhananand could not kill him
so what chance do
you have against him?
Who will come here?
Why will they come?
And from where?
Lord Durgam.
I am here to inform you
that Lakha was not lying.
He has proven himself to the Emperor.
What do you think?
He was here to inform you?
No.
He was here to ensure if I was safe
and he will now go to Chandragupta
to tell him that I am safe
and someone else will come later
and this will go on.
Deception!
Do not try to deceive me!
I know what you seek is foul
but it is about my son
and his allies
so
I will come to you.
It is the fate of river
to merge in the sea.
And to reach this fate
the river overcomes
ever obstacle it faces
and it keeps moving ahead.
And finally
it meets the sea.
So if you seek something in your life
then you must not see
it simply as your mark
but think of it as
your destiny and go for it.
Only then you can
hold the unwavering focus
to reach your goal.
One that a river has to meet the sea.
And thus it can cross
any hurdle it in's path
to reach its goal.
My ethics..
Your destiny.
Acharya, I have understood
what the problem is
and what is making her worried.
I am more than enough to take
revenge of my mother's insult.

================================================================================

Episode: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6YaEC5XnPms

I will come to you
but on my own terms.
When everyone will be busy with
Goddess Druga's veneration tonight
no one will notice my absence.
But remember this.
I am giving away my everything
only to safeguard my son
and his companions.
If you reveal our truth to Dhananand..
That's fine..
The emperor will not
get to know your truth.
But you have to
adorn yourself from head
to toe with the ornaments I gave you
dress up like a bride
and come to my room.
If you want
the safety of your son and his team
you will have to do as I say.
Or else, I will present that bangle
and your truth
to Emperor Dhananand.
I can't believe
that you fooled Emperor Dhananand.
How did you do this, Acharya?
I did nothing special, Stulbhadra.
Before taking up the barber's form
I took the training of a barber's job.
Stulbhadra, remember this.
The knowledge you earn
will never go to waste.
That's why, I'm always prepared
to learn different things
and gain knowledge.
Chandragupta, where are you lost?
Acharya..
I lost
my mother's bangle.
I am just worried
if Dhananand gets that bangle..
Chandragupta why didn't
you tell me this earlier
that you have lost the bangle?
I didn't get the right
opportunity, Acharya.
This can put us in danger.
And the problem will
only get severe with time.
Dhananand is not someone
who will sit back quietly.
He will surely do something.
May you be victorious always.
Everything has been arranged
to proceed to Patliputra,
Your Majesty.
We are only waiting for your orders.
Amatya, you are planning
to depart from here
whereas, I am gathering knowledge
about whatever is happening here.
I wonder why
I can sense some conspiracy.
Conspiracy?
What conspiracy, Your Majesty?
This.. This message
that was sent to me
by Dahak and Nishumbha.
It is clear from this
that they knew where Chandragupta
and his companions are.
They were going to present
their bodies before me
which means,
they had targeted the enemies.
They must have definitely
made some minor mistake
and they both lost their lives
as a result of Chanakya's conspiracy.
What does all this mean?
This only means our enemies
are not away from us.
They are somewhere around us.
Possibly, in Paraspura.
You are right, Your Majesty.
But we can leave
- our spies behind.
- No!
No, Amatya.
After Dahak and Nishumbha,
I do not trust any spies.
That's why, I want you to take this up
yourself.
Follow each and every method
Dahak and Nishumbha had used
to kill Chandragupta and his
companions and find out the truth.
I have complete faith
that we will find
some evidence very soon
and we will be able
to trace Chandragupta.
As you say, Your Majesty.
You investigate on
this and in the meanwhile
I will discuss something
important with Jagatjala.
I hope you have made
the proper arrangements
for the King and his army
regarding food and other things.
Remember, he should not have
any problem in reaching Patliputra.
Don't worry,
Sire, all the arrangements are made.
King Dhananand is coming.
Your Highness!
Jagatjala.. My dear friend
I am so happy with your
welcome and hospitality
that I've postponed my decision
of returning to Patliputra.
Now I will stay at Paraspura
for a few more days
and enjoy your hospitality.
What is the matter?
You don't look happy with my decision?
No, Your Majesty.
This is my good fortune,
I am very happy.
I am happy because I have heard of
the stories of the massive celebration
of Durga Pooja in Paraspura.
So I thought,
why don't I experience it personally!
We are very fortunate, Your Majesty.
Your presence in the
great veneration of Goddess Durga
will make the celebration even bigger.
I am fortunate, Lady Kalki.
You go ahead and
make the preparations.
I'll meet you at night.
Sure.
As long as he stays here
we will be in danger.
I hope he doesn't find out the truth
that I know about
Chandragupta and his group.
If that happens,
there will be catastrophe.
Till Dhananand does
not leave Paraspura
we need to stay extremely alert.
He is not leaving, Acharya.
- What?
- Yes.
I have just received information
that Dhananand has decided
to stay here for a few more days.
No one knows for
how long he will stay.
If he has decided to stay
that means
he has a doubt.
Means, we must leave this
place as soon as possible.
But, Chandra,
how will we escape from here?
The soldiers are stationed
all around the palace.
This is impossible.
It's not impossible..
It's difficult.
And we will have to do
this difficult task today.
Today is Durga Pooja,
everyone would be busy in that.
We will have to take advantage
of this and leave from here tonight.
Till Dhananand finds out
we will be far away from
the borders of Paraspura.
And the plan to escape from here
will be made by Queen Mura.
She is supervising
all the preparations for
Durga Pooja along with Kalki.
She knows everyone's activities.
Hence, Queen
you will tell us what is
the right time to leave from here.
I am sorry, Acharya,
were you saying something to me?
Mother, where is your attention?
Everything is fine, I hope.
No, it's fine,
I was thinking of something else.
I apologise.
Yes, Acharya.
I was saying,
tonight at the Durga Pooja
we have to escape from here.
You will make the plan.
You will tell us what is
the right time to leave from here.
Okay, tonight we will
all meet in the stable.
As soon as Durga Pooja starts,
we will leave from here.
But remember, if anyone is left behind
no one will wait for them.
What are you saying, Mother?
Why will anyone be left behind?
We have planned our escape, right?
This is not the time to discuss.
Before anyone sees us,
spread out in the palace.
Why does mother seem so distracted?
And why is she behaving like that?
Don't think about that right now.
Just pay attention to the plan.
Everyone, remember
according to Queen Mura's plan
tonight,
as soon as the veneration starts
we have to escape from here.
Your Majesty
Goddess Durga's veneration
is about to start.
Everyone is waiting for you.
Any update from Amatya?
Not yet, Your Majesty.
No worries.
I have complete faith
that Amatya will send some good news
regarding Chandragupta very soon.
Mother, where are you?
The veneration is about to begin
and I do not have more time either.
I wonder why I feel
you are in some danger
and you are not telling me about it.
There is definitely something
that is bothering you.
'If you want to safeguard
your son and his group'
'just do as I say.'
'Or else, I will present that bangle'
'and your truth to emperor Dhananand.'
This enticing scent of your body.
I cannot stay away from it for long.
Adorn from head to
toe dress up like a bride
and come to my room.
Queen Mura.
But remember this.
Do not try to cheat me.
Because you know
that Emperor Dhananand
has stayed back in Paraspura
for Goddess Durga's veneration.
So, it is a clear situation now.
As long as you keep me happy
I will keep quiet.
And only my silence
can safeguard you and your son.
Isn't it?
That is why, wear this attire
and these ornaments at the earliest
and come to my room.
Or else..
[Sanskrit shlok]
[Sanskrit shlok]
[Sanskrit shlok]
[Sanskrit shlok]
Durgeshwari, hear me out.
I know who you are.
Durgam has bad intentions towards you
and he has called you
to his room tonight.
But I will not let this happen.
I have a plan
with which you can go away from
this palace before the night begins!
Queen Kalki
your plan can help me escape
but what about other women?
What about all the other women
towards whom wicked
Durgam has bad intentions?
Will he continue dishonouring women?
Today, all women
are praying to Goddess Durga.
The Goddess Durga who is the symbol
of immense power within any woman.
But even today wicked men like Durgam
continue doing such misdeeds
in the society, fearlessly.
And we women keep quiet?
So what's the use of this veneration?
What are you trying to say?
If a woman is unaware of the truth
that there is a part of
the form of Goddess Durga in her
and that she also has the power
to end sin and injustice
then there is no importance
of this 'Durga Puja'.
We will have to identify
the courage and strength
hidden within us.
Lady Kalki..
Do not worry about me.
If you really want to worry
worry about the silence of women
which gives rise to many Durgams
and gives them the courage
to target any Durgeshwari.
We will have to remind the women
that they are not the weaker ones
but the men who consider
the silence of women
as their strength are weak.
I am sorry, Your Majesty.
I know that you are going
to give a great speech
before King Dhananand
in order to impress him.
And you wanted to
practice the same with me.
I know that I am only your servant
and I should be ready
only to serve you.
Are you really
an ordinary servant, Arjun?
I agree that I am not very brave.
But I have a good sight.
Friend, I do not know
what you know about me
and what you do not know.
But life has taught me one thing.
And that is,
we see some dreams in life
in front of which nobody
holds any importance.
Neither our family nor our friends
nor ourselves.
But as much as I have
understood you so far
I am very sure
that if you have to choose
one among justice and injustice
without any doubt
you will definitely
follow the path of justice.
Arjun, I am happy
to see your trust in me.
But I do not have the support
that a master of an extraordinary slave
like you deserves.
Destiny has given me a father
who does not have
any value or love for me.
According to him, I cannot do anything
and I will never be able
to do anything either.
Moreover, destiny has given me
a cruel, weak and cunning uncle
in the form of Durgam Daga
for whom I do not even have
the right words to humiliate.
He is such a weak man
that he can use all his strength
only on the maids of this palace.
Like a vulture
he always keeps eyeing their beauty.
'Was mother's disturbed
state related to Durgam Daga?'
'I will have to find out soon.'
Just how this pipe increases
the fire of this oven
praise is a medium
in the life of human beings
which increases our confidence.
But if it is not used within a limit
and without proper knowledge
the same pipe will increase
the fire to an extent
that it will burn
everything into ashes.
Similarly, in life too
limitless praise blinds us
and we stop seeing the reality.
So, beware of those who praise you
because every time
their intention may not be
to increase your confidence
but to destroy your identity.
My ethics..
Your destiny.
Acharya, I have understood
what the problem is
and what is making her worried.
I am more than enough to take
revenge of my mother's insult.

================================================================================

Episode: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RAWpWDW3lg0

The destiny has given me a cruel, weak
and crooked uncle, Durgam Daga.
I do not have enough
words to condemn him.
He is so weak
that he can only show his power
to the slaves of this palace.
He casts a lecherous stare upon them.
I did not get anyone's support
despite having a family.
But now, you have
a friend like me.
Yes.
And I have a suggestion for my friend.
Please go from here
as soon as possible.
I will not disclose your identity.
But if you stay here further
the situation will be
beyond my control.
The veneration of Goddess Durga
is about to start.
I will take leave now.
The chief minister is not here.
The emperor has sent him
to collect facts and evidence.
I am getting worried, Durgam.
I think we should tell the emperor
the truth regarding Chandragupta.
No, brother.
This is not the right time.
I have a plan
to tell the emperor
the truth at the right time.
Please leave everything to me.
And rest assured.
Because wrinkles on your forehead
will make the emperor grow suspicious.
What are you discussing
with each other?
Nothing, Your Highness. Nothing.
Your Highness, we were discussing
that by the grace of the
Goddess we have got your company
on this auspicious occasion.
Your Highness,
I will take your leave now.
I will be back soon after
finishing an important work.
I will take leave now.
What happened, Jagatjala?
Why are sweating so much?
A person sweats when
he is scared of someone.
- Is everything all right?
- Yes, Your Highness.
Everything is fine.
Neither did Lady Mura reach
here nor did Chandragupta.
God knows where they are.
A new slave will come
here soon to take my place.
We have to get out of here
before he comes.
Otherwise, our plan will fail.
Chandragupta.
Finally, you have arrived.
But where is Queen Mura?
I searched the entire palace.
But she is not found.
Something is fishy for sure.
Mother is in trouble.
But why did she not tell me anything?
'Is everything fine?
What did Durga ask you?'
- 'Why are you looking so restless?'
- 'Nothing.'
'I was anxious assuming that
she overheard our conversation.'
Because it was
her personal problem.
And it was such a problem
that every woman hesitates
to share with anyone else
especially with her son.
But who can create a personal
problem for her, Acharya?
'The destiny has given me a cruel,
weak' 'and crooked uncle, Durgam.'
'He is so weak that
he can only show his power'
'to the slaves of this palace.'
Acharya, I have understood
what the problem is
and what is making her worried.
He is the one
who is a problem for other slaves too.
Durgam Daga.
All of us will punish him
without fail.
- Yes.
- Let us go.
No!
I am more than enough to take revenge
of my mother's insult.
How will someone
protect his motherland
if he is unable to protect his mother?
All of you, wait here for me.
I will be back soon with mother
after punishing Durgam for his sins.
As soon the grand veneration
of Durga Puja
will start we will leave from here.
Slave.
Slave, wait.
'I need to find a way
to distract Bhadrasaal's attention.'
Are you blind?
He is deaf too. I have been
calling you from a long time.
Listen.
My horse is not well
since the morning.
I want to check on him.
Take me to the stable.
'What kind of a dilemma is this?'
'I cannot accompany him.
Because mother needs me.'
'And I cannot take him to the stable.'
'Because Acharya
and others are there.'
Did you not hear me?
It is my order. Take me to the stable.
Okay..
Please come with me.
Queen Mura, where are you?
Mura!
Goddess Durga has given me
a precious blessing.
Tonight is going to be very special.
Mura, do you know which quality
of yours attracts me the most?
Your..
Your arrogance of being a queen.
I am enchanted by this.
Many women came to my life before.
But they were weak.
They were dumb.
They did not have any fire in them.
But you..
It will be an immense
pleasure to break your ego
which I never experienced before.
Tonight, a warrior queen
will surrender herself to me.
And mere thinking about
this makes me excited and happy.
Everything that glitters
is not gold, Durgam.
Things are often not
what they appear to be.
Even there are various forms of women.
Do not think that the forms of women
you have seen till now is the reality.
Even Goddess appeared to be delicate
in the form of Goddess Parvati.
But the same Goddess Parvati
took her violent form
and punished the demons
in the form of Goddess Kali.
Incredible! Incredible!
Why are you telling me
the story of Goddess Parvati
and demons in the incredible night?
I am not telling you a story.
I am telling you the reality.
I am warning you.
Because it is the time
to show you the woman power.
[Sanskrit shlok]
[Sanskrit shlok]
[Sanskrit shlok]
[Sanskrit shlok]
Durgam, see.
They are not nine women.
They are the nine
forms of Goddess Durga.
Who will show you what women power is.
Together, they will end you today.
Slave..
It seems like
you are wandering through the palace.
Do you know the way to stables or not?
Pardon me, Commander. Pardon me.
The palace is so big
that I am a bit lost.
I will send a slave who
might be able to help you.
I will be right back.
Hey! Slave!
I have to find the stables myself.
I knew that you are Queen Mura.
And being a Kshatriya,
you would not give up that easy.
Fine, let me tell you
about one of my specialty.
I, Durgam
am the best swordsman of Paraspura.
There is no need to fear him.
Cries of pain are very powerful.
So powerful that bellows made out
of a dead bull's skin can burn iron.
Our souls have more power
than his sword does.
Today, we have to show
him what women power is.
Attack!
Foolish maids!
"Hail Mother Goddess.
Hail the destroyer of enemies."
"You are a symbol of power.
You grant happiness."
"Omniscient Mother Goddess
has many forms."
"Everyone bows to Mother Goddess."
"Mother Goddess delivers
people from pain."
"Her warrior form kills enemies."
"She is called the Mother Goddess."
"Mother Goddess has
nine glorious forms.."
"Mother Goddess has
nine glorious forms.."
"Mother Goddess has
nine glorious forms.."
Your Majesty,
your suspicion was right.
Dahak and Nishumbha had
caught Chandragupta's band
and they were about to kill
them but Lakha Napit came there
and turned the tables.
That means, Lakha Napit is..
He is Chanakya.
He is not the only one
who has deceived us.
Jagatjala!
Your game ends now, Jagatjala!
Pardon me, Your Majesty,
I hid this truth from you because
my brother, Durgam, asked me to.
Your brother knows where Chandragupta
and his companions are!
Take me to him immediately.
Be alert!
He is a cannibal demon.
Darkness empowers him.
But today.. Today we will
end the darkness of his sins.
Light up the torches!
There! Towards that gate.
He must have run away through there.
Stop!
What is your plan now, Mura?
Your plan was good.
But you forgot that I am Durgam!
This was not my first time.
Countless women like you
have come into my life
they fluttered around,
and then they bowed to me as you will.
Mura, I will feel happy.
Very happy.
You will regret your deeds, Durgam.
Remember this, you are not
advancing towards me but your death.
Think once again.
Why should I? What can you do to me?
Yes? These..
You will attack me
with your nails? Yes?
Do it. Do it. That would be so fun.
Do it!
Durgam!
In our nation,
many Goddesses are venerated.
They are revered.
But in our very nation
in most places
women do not get that same respect.
And that is
because of the age old mentality
that women are weak
and men are better.
But, the women are mothers
the reason behind the existence of men
how can they be weak?
That is why it is necessary
to change the mentality
that thinks of women as weak.
Only then the betterment of family,
society and nation is possible..
When each woman gets the
same respect a Goddess does.
My ethics..
Your destiny.
Your sins have exceeded
their limit, Durgam.

================================================================================

Episode: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1VXo_oXpk0

Your sins have exceeded
their limit, Durgam.
It is time to be
punished for those sins.
Today you will realise
that a woman is not only a mother
but also the destroyer.
Excellent!
Mother and son!
Death! Final justice!
Today, my son's each attack
is inspired by my bloodline.
You have seen a woman only as a mother
today see her as a destroyer.
[Sanskrit shlok]
[Sanskrit shlok]
[Sanskrit shlok]
Whenever the sins of demons
like you increase on earth
then Goddess Durga
takes the form of death.
Today, you will become the witness
of the destruction of Mahakali.
Hit him, Chandragupta! Hit him.
Durgam!
Mega veneration is about to begin.
Chandragupta and Queen Mura
should have come here by now.
Stop, Chandragupta!
This culprit deserves mine
and these maids' punishment
whom he had cast his evil eye on.
[Sanskrit shlok]
[Sanskrit shlok]
[Sanskrit shlok]
[Sanskrit shlok]
[Sanskrit shlok]
[Sanskrit shlok]
[Sanskrit shlok]
Look, Durgam! Look at me
and remember every woman
whom you thought to
be helpless and exploited
whose self-respect and
dignity was destroyed by you.
All those women whose
lives were destroyed by you.
Look, Durgam!
Today, your death
will be nothing in front of your sins.
But I promise you that,
even after your death
in every birth hereafter
your sins and your death
will haunt you forever.
Your body will breathe its last today
but the pain and the suffering
will continue eternally
and set an example
so that no man should ever
think of molesting a woman,
of her chastity.
Get ready to meet your end, Durgam!
"Hail Mother Goddess.
Hail the destroyer of enemies."
"You are a symbol of power.
You grant happiness."
"Omniscient Mother Goddess
has many forms."
"Everyone bows to Mother Goddess."
"Mother Goddess delivers
people from pain."
"Her warrior form kills enemies."
"She is called the Mother Goddess."
"She is called the Mother Goddess."
"Mother Goddess has
nine glorious forms.."
"Mother Goddess has
nine glorious forms.."
"Mother Goddess has
nine glorious forms.."
Durgam!
Durgam, my brother..
Durgam, get up. Get up, Durgam!
- Durgam!
- Who?
Who killed Durgam?
I.. I killed Durgam!
You shouldn't have come over here.
You should've escaped with the others.
Can a son abandon her mother
in such a critical moment?
Chandra!
We may be caught,
for what we have done.
I don't think so, Mother.
All the others have
reached the stable.
We should manage to
reach the stable somehow
before Dhananand gets
to know our reality.
Let's go, Mother.
You?
But why did you kill my brother?
Answer me, as to why did you kill him?
Because he crossed his limits.
He tried to rip me of my chastity.
So, I killed him along with my maids.
It is fair enough.
The one who crosses the limits
should meet the end of his life
correct.
But the question is how did you do it?
Demonstrate to me
as to how you killed him.
Think about it.
Imagine that I was the one
who tried to assault you.
I am standing where Durgam
was standing
a few moments ago.
Take this!
Attack me.
What happened?
A few moments ago
you used this trident to kill him,
did you not?
Hold it.
Hold it!
Do you think I am foolish
enough to trust you?
Did you kill him?
All of you are lying.
And you! Jagatjala, you knew
that my assassins had captured
Chandragupta and his comrades.
But due to your foolishness
you let them go and
killed my assassins!
Now, like you
even your wife is lying.
Forgive me, Your Highness.
This was the result of my foolishness.
Darn it!
Your brother was killed by the
Kshatriya woman, Mura
and not your wife!
Moreover,
Mura is in this palace right now!
Amatya Rakshas, get our army ready.
No one should leave this palace.
Make an announcement
in entire Paraspura
that no one should
leave his or her house.
The city should crawl
with the soldiers of Magadh.
Where is Bhadrasaal?
Go through that door and keep walking.
Take a left and you
will reach the stable.
We need to do something
to distract Bhadrasaal.
I had taken it from
the assassin, Dahak.
Now, it will help us.
Who is there?
Rest assured, Your Highness.
I made them close
all the escape routes.
Chandragupta and his comrades
will soon be captured by us
as leaving this place is impossible.
No. No, Amatya Rakshas.
Do not make the mistake
of underestimating him again.
We have to find out where Chandragupta
and his comrades are in this palace
and what they are thinking
as soon as possible.
To leave this palace
we need to find a way other
than the path through the stable.
Acharya, I think we should
spread out in different groups
and find different options
to leave this place.
If everything goes perfectly
then we will meet
underneath the Sycamore
in the forest as soon as possible.
Someone is here.
Baldev.
Martand?
Please have mercy..
Do not kill me.
I.. I will not tell
anything to anyone.
I.. I will not tell
anything to anyone.
No, Baldev.
Stop. Leave him.
But prince he has heard our plan.
And I know that this
plan is very important.
I have spent my entire life in palace.
If you have faith in me then
I can tell you about
such a secret door
through which you can
leave this palace safely.
And you can be saved
from King Dhananand.
Both of you will be punished by death
as you are traitors to the throne.
But I am letting you
live for a few more moments
because you know the disguise
that has been donned
by Chandragupta and his comrades.
- Amatya Rakshas.
- Yes, Your Highness?
Go with Jagatjala
and search the eastern
and northern sides of the palace
after passing through the stables.
As you order.
- Bhadrasaal.
- Yes, Your Highness?
Go with this seditious woman
and look for them in the southern
and the western parts of the palace.
As you order, Your Highness.
Until they are found, their
son will stay with me as a keepsake.
Bring their son,
Martand, before me. Now!
There is a secret door in the
north-east direction of this palace.
Through the middle room..
A tunnel follows that secret
door and it ends in the jungle.
There you all will find horses there.
And it will be easy
for you all to escape.
Let me go.
Baldev, Let him go.
He will not be a problem for us.
No, Prince.
What if he reveals
our truth to Dhananand?
I have spent a lot
of time with him, Baldev.
Believe me. Let him go.
It is fine if it is your decision.
We have to reach the secret path soon.
Yes, but it will be
risky to go there together.
Someone might see us.
We have to pair up and reach there
using different paths of the palace.
Indra, accompany Stulbhadra.
Baldev, you will stay with Acharya
and I will accompany my mother.
No, Chandragupta.
You will not accompany Queen Mura.
When you stay with her you lose
your decision-making capabilities.
- But, Acharya..
- He is right, Chandra.
You will accompany Stulbhadra,
Chandragupta.
And I will accompany Queen Mura.
All right. Let us go.
I hope that Martand
will not betray us.
Find Martand as soon as possible.
I am sure
that like his traitorous parents
he must be helping our enemies.
My father is not a traitor,
Your Highness.
I am not a traitor either.
I know that you can kill me
right away, but I am still here.
I am here to prove
that I am loyal to you.
I know where Chandragupta
and his group are.
I can take you to them.
If I keep the fire
of this torch under control
and light another torch
then it will brighten this room.
But..
If I lose my control
over the fire of this torch
and it falls into this oil container
then it will result
in a dangerous explosion.
Power is similar to this fire.
If it is under control
then it clears your path.
But if it goes out of control
then it can end your goal as well.
So, remember
that having power is advantageous
but for attaining your goal
you need patience
and control along with power.
My ethics..
Your destiny.
I had seen him heading towards
the stable with his mother.
They have got information
about the secret door
of the palace through someone.
And they are heading there.

================================================================================

Episode: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Be_IFqvqNO4

I know the whereabouts
of Chandragupta and his aides.
And I can take you to them.
And how do you know
that Chandragupta is in this palace
at present?
He is your friend.
And he has told you all this.
Right?
No, Your Majesty.
I had seen him heading towards
the stable with his mother.
Even I had gone and
hidden in the stable.
I have heard each
and every conversation of theirs
carefully, Your Majesty.
They were discussing
their future plans over there.
They have got information
about the secret door
of the palace through someone.
And they are heading there.
But every moment spent on
answering each question of yours
may prove costly to you.
Because at present,
this time is taking you away from them
and them away from this palace.
All right.
- Take me over there quickly.
- Pardon me, Your Majesty.
Not so soon.
Firstly, I wish to ensure
the safety of my parents.
For that, I want a promise from you
that after finding
Chandragupta and his aides
you will not kill my parents.
Only then will I help you.
Do you want to negotiate with me,
Dhananand, Emperor of Magadh?
Yes.
Because today,
I am standing before an emperor
who is yearning to capture
his greatest enemy and traitor.
And for that,
he is ready to do anything.
Anything possible, Your Majesty.
You are not as useless as you look.
All right.
I will spare your parents.
Come, take me to
Chandragupta at the earliest.
- Let us go!
- Pardon me, Your Majesty.
But first and foremost,
I would like to see my parents
before me, safe.
Only after that will
I take you to the secret door.
Martand!
Present his parents here soon.
Look at them carefully, Jagatjala.
Is Chandragupta or any
of his aides among them?
No, Amatya.
None of them are here.
No matter what,
I want Chandragupta and his aides.
Hail Amatya!
His Majesty has summoned Chief Jagatjala
to the court immediately.
Listen! Look here..
Check if anything
has gone into my eyes.
Listen, if we split into groups
and look for them
in different directions
we will surely be able
to capture those traitors soon.
Here is what we can do.
We will look for them
in this part of the palace.
And you all,
in that part of the palace.
Yes. Look for them in that part.
Go. Rush.
Straight and the secret
door is on the right side.
Let us go.
How is it possible
that you did not see Chandragupta
and his friends leave the stable?
You all are saying lies.
We are saying the truth, chief.
Believe us.
I was not present there at that time.
You were not present?
If at the time of work
you are not present at your place
then for what work do you take salary?
Move. Move fast.
I do not have all day
to identify you all. Move.
Move.
Come.
Please look at them carefully.
And tell me if that traitor
maid Mura is among them.
Wait!
His Majesty has ordered that
Chief Jagatjala's wife be released
and presented before him
in the court immediately.
Please wait!
Firstly, tell me if Chandragupta
or any of his aides are among these.
No.
None of them are here.
Dhananand has released Kalki.
Could it be because of Martand?
I fear that because
of Martand's betrayal
tDhananand will come to know
of Chandragupta's whereabouts.
Hurry up, Stul.
We have almost reached.
Stul, it seems this is the path
which will lead us to the secret door.
- It seems this has got stuck.
- Yes.
This will not open at all
but I know, we can make it through.
Come with me, Stul.
Come. Give it a try, Stul. Come.
Chandra,
this seems to be very difficult.
I'll not be able to make it through.
At least give it a try, Stul.
Stul!
Sentries are coming, Chandra.
I will get caught. Get out of here!
This path will lead you
to the secret door, Chandra.
- Hurry up, Chandra! Leave!
- No, Stul.
I will not abandon you.
There are no exits left.
Run, Chandra. Stop worrying about me.
Do not worry about me! Run, Chandra!
Stop shouting, Stul!
Calm down!
Stul, do as I say.
Do you see those
pitchers on your left?
There are some small
earthen pots with it.
Go there and make those
sentries drink water.
Gradually,
reach the other end of the tunnel.
I will walk along with
you inside the tunnel
and open the exit door.
Then, you will have
to enter through that door
to reach this tunnel, okay?
Do not get nervous.
- Okay.
- Leave.
Martand!
Jagatjala.
This son of yours
is like a poisonous snake
whose head I would love to crush!
He.. Your son..
In exchange of his loyalty
he wants to see that
both your lives are spared.
If he does not take me
to Chandragupta and his friends
then along with you all he
will not live to see the morrow.
Your Highness
you carried out your promise
and made me see my parents..
Alive.
So even I will fulfill my promise.
Please come. Come with me.
Only Stul and Chandragupta are left.
As soon as they come we will
make an exit through this secret door.
Please quench your thirst.
You all are perspiring a lot.
Please drink the cold water.
Cold water.
Hey! This is not right.
Will you give us
only water and not food?
Did you eat all the food
or have you left anything for us?
Obese boy!
How dare you call me obese!
You are fat.
So I have to call you obese.
You don't know who I am!
Do you know whom you
soldiers are looking out for?
Stop standing there like a fool!
Fatso, is this search
happening for you?
Yes.
I am the one.. Stulbhadra!
I am the bosom friend of Chandragupta.
I am his right hand man.
You soldiers are trying
to catch me and my friends!
Sthul, get out of here!
Fatso, so many times I have told you
to cut down on your
weight and get some brains!
Let us get out of here.
Today I will complete my task.
The sun will go down
forever for Piplivan.
Chandra!
Chandragupta, why are you so late?
- Is everything okay?
- No, Acharya.
We do not have time.
We have to make an exit
from the secret door quickly..
Today itself.
Look, Your Highness.
Chandragupta and
the rest of his friends.
I had said before that
Martand is not to be trusted.
Baldev, save this topic for later on.
As of now,
open this cover of the tunnel.
This tunnel will take us
far away from the palace.
Come.
Go, Mother. Go..
No. You go first.
No, Mother. Go.
You go first!
Dhananand will be here soon.
We have no time to waste. Go.
I will not go without
getting you to safety.
- You go first.
- Chandragupta!
For India's future,
listen to your mother.
Come!
Go! I am coming behind you.
Okay.
Come, Mother. Give me your hand. Come.
Mother!
Mother!
Come, Mother.
Give me your hand. Try, Mother!
Chandragupta.
You cannot go down.
- But..
- Do you trust me?
Yes.
It is my duty to get Queen Mura here.
Take everyone else and go north.
You will find an ancient building
after going a bit further.
Hide in the ruins and wait for me.
I will get the queen there.
Go, Chandragupta.
Go, I am coming. I am coming. Go.
Go fast!
Okay.
Acharya..
Welcome, as my handmaiden. Mura!
Where is Acharya and mother?
Why are they not here yet?
They are here! Look.
Where is mother?
W-Where is mother?
You told me that you
would get her with you.
Where is she?
Where is she?
Why are you silent?
Tell me where she is.
Queen Mura was not able
to get out of the tunnel in time.
You mean, Dhananand captured her?
Chandragupta! Wait!
I will not let you go.
Let me go!
My mother needs me right now!
Wait, Chandragupta! Wait.
Dhananand might be waiting for you.
You cannot take such a big risk.
I do not care!
As long as mother is there,
my only goal
is to get her here safely.
Chandragupta!
Dhananand did not capture her!
I got her captured!
If I tell you to
fix this broken mirror
you will not be able to do it
no matter how hard you try.
Relationships that
break because of betrayal
also become like this broken mirror.
They keep hurting
you like broken glass.
It hurts everyone in the relationship.
That is why whenever someone trusts us
be careful
not to break that trust.
Because things change after that.
Neither relations
nor trust stays the same.
My ethics..
Your destiny.
I will reach Pataliputra soon
and then you cannot even imagine
how miserable your life will become.

================================================================================

Episode: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7JrCGo_x1M

Where is Mura?
Oh! She is not here.
Where is Mura?
She is not here either.
Where is Mura?
I found Mura..
I found Mura..
I found here..
This is not fair.
I was enjoying this hide and seek.
But you made me win this so easily.
You just ruined my entertainment.
This is cheating.
But I did not understand something.
What went wrong, after all?
Did you become unlucky?
No..
Your exiled son left you.
That is right.
You did so much for him.
You hid so much from me.
In the mountains, rivers, forests
and you even served
people in this palace.
I must say, you tried well.
But everything went in vain.
And look
you ended up exactly
where you had started.
You are a maid again.
And your rebel son..
Even he couldn't save you.
So sad!
But
do not be too sad, Mura.
Because I am not done yet.
I have many things to do.
I will reach Pataliputra soon
and then you cannot even imagine
how miserable your life will become.
Why, Acharya? Why did you do this?
Did you cheat the mother of the one
whom you choose to
safeguard the United Bharat?
Do you have any answer for this,
Acharya?
I dedicated myself to you
and considered you as my guru.
I accepted you as my mentor.
I kept moving on the path
which you showed me
without even asking you any question.
I trusted you.
And that is why
I left my mom with you.
Then why did you betray me?
When Dhananand destroyed
Piplivan 12 years ago
he forced my mother to
be his servant to show the world
as to how the warrior
woman of Piplivan
has been reduced to a maid.
And now
I do not know what he will do with her
to brag about his victory.
Your attention please!
This is for everyone!
As you all know
she is the queen of Piplivan
the wife of Chandravardhan
and the mother of the traitor
the warrior woman, Mura.
Today, you have this golden chance.
Today, you will express
your respect towards her
by hurling your shoes at her.
And those who do not
fulfill this command of mine
will face punishment.
Hit her!
You..
This is just the beginning
of your humiliation.
Keep watching
as to how I conclude this story.
Looks like
I did a very big mistake
in understanding Martand
and even you, Acharya.
Chandragupta, neither did you
make any mistake in understand Martand
nor did you judged me wrong.
Because neither he nor
did I have betrayed you.
Martand did all that as per my plan
so that we can exit safely
from Jagatjala's palace.
So that he can win Dhananand's
trust and save his life.
Martand is your real friend,
Chandragupta.
He is not a cheat.
As far as Mura's matter is concerned
remember this
we either hunt in
a forest or fall prey.
Dhananand is on hunt
for us
and we are saving ourselves from him.
But for how long?
He will be successful
in his motive someday.
And the day we get caught
forget about the
dream of United Bharat
he will not even spare our lives.
I agree that we have
failed all his attempts.
But do you know how
it is affecting our morale?
We are wasting our time
which we should have invested
in building the United Bharat.
Enough of this hide and
seek between Dhananand and us.
Now we will wage a war.
But, was getting my mother arrested
the only option to achieve this?
How can you even think of this?
What strategy is that?
It is not just a strategy.
This is politics.
The game of being shrewd.
- But, Acharya..
- Chandra.
Allow him to clarify.
Even I do not agree
with what he has done.
But I am sure that he has
a reason behind this.
Dhananand's strength is the fear
which he has instilled in his people.
And because of that, nobody even dares
to go against him.
You should finish that very fear.
But how can we end this fear in them
by getting my mother arrested?
In fact,
this will increase their fear.
And people will think that
if he can do something like this
with the rebel queen of Piplivan
he can do anything with them.
Dhananand must be considering
the arrest of Mura
as his achievement.
He will surely
try to propagate this.
He must be immersed in his ego now
because of which he will
fail to sense the future danger.
And we will attack him
exactly when his ego reaches its peak.
What attack would it be, Acharya?
You will breach his security
and steal the most
precious thing of his
from right under his nose.
And then the world will know
that Chandragupta is a
tough competitor to Dhananand.
The whole world will know
that you are the Chandra
who is here to finish
this egoistic king.
You will snatch away Dhananand's
most favourite thing from him
and use it as a weapon.
And you will make Dhananand
bow down before his subjects
using the same.
Only then will his subjects
be able to get rid of their fear.
And the light of hope will spread all over
instead of fear.
The hope of getting a just king
who will remove oppressor
Dhananand from his throne
and rule not just
Magadh but entire India.
Remember one thing, Chandragupta.
All that matters to a king
is his subjects, their hope and trust.
Without them no king
can retain his kingdom
no matter how powerful he is.
Hence, you will have to snatch away
Dhananand's most
favourite thing from him
and use it as a weapon against him.
But Acharya, nothing matters
to Dhananand except himself.
Think once again, Chandragupta.
Dhananand is your biggest enemy.
But once you were close to him.
Think again.
If you want to hurt him the most
if you want to trouble him the most
what you will do.
Use your conscience, Chandragupta.
Think who that person is
whom Dhananand loves the most.
Who that person is
for whom Dhananand can do anything.
Who matters to Dhananand the most.
'The apple of my eye,
the only star in my heart'
'my adorable sister,
a warm welcome to you.'
'Brother.'
Durdhara.
I will never be able
to understand you.
Attention! Amatya Rakshas is arriving.
Hail the princess!
I am happy to see you, Amatya Rakshas.
When did you return from Paraspura?
And brother.. Where is he?
He did not even send me
a message from there.
The emperor is busy, Your Highness.
Hence, he has sent me here
to inform you
that he has returned to Patliputra
after defeating Paraspura.
What about that slave?
I am talking about Chandragupta.
Yes, Princess.
We have hurt him so badly that
it is impossible for him to recover.
He will suffer until he dies.
- This means, he is still alive.
- Yes.
You can say so.
But the person who matters
to him the most is in our custody.
We have held his mother,
Mura, captive once again.
And this can be proved fatal for him.
Where is Mura?
I.. I want to meet her.
She is serving punishment
for being the mother of a rebel.
The emperor himself
is dragging her here.
I want to go there right now.
No, Princess. You cannot go there.
That place is very crowded.
And it is my responsibility
to take care of your security.
I cannot let you go there.
A ruler is supposed
to give permission.
And it is the duty of servants
to follow his order.
Hence, no one can stop me from
attending my brother's victory march.
Princess.. Princess!
Keep playing. Louder!
It should be such a grand affair
that the sound of the celebration
should be heard by Chandragupta
with his mother's scream.
Torture her. Insult her.
She is a traitor..
Shame on her..
She is a traitor..
Shame on her..
Celebrate the occasion. Enjoy.
Even the sun is giving
us enough light today.
And Queen Mura
is not able to look at the sun.
Nor is she able to look at my eyes.
It is scorching hot today.
You must be feeling thirsty, Mura.
Get water for her.
She is a traitor..
Shame on her..
She is a traitor..
Shame on her.. Shame on her..
What do you think
that I will lose my courage
due to lack of water?
No one is a bigger idiot than you,
Dhananand.
My son will turn your
celebration into mourning.
I will drink water.
I will definitely drink water.
And you will
feed me water, Dhananand.
That too, from your hand.
My son will force you to do so.
Prince, we will rescue
Queen Mura soon.
Do not worry.
Your highness, listen to me.
It is not safe to go there.
Princess..
You already know what
we are supposed to do
how and when.
Dhananand, just wait and watch
how I will snatch her away from you
whom you love the most
your beloved sister, Durdhara.
'The divine are extremely
happy where women are respected.'
'Where they are not,
all actions are fruitless.'
This means, where women
are treated with respect
Gods shower Their blessings there.
But where women are treated badly
not even a good deed
is rewarded there.
Hence, we should always respect women.
Remember one thing.
Women power is so important
that if they are on your side
they can help you
on your path to success.
But if they are upset with you,
they can ruin you too.
My ethics..
Your destiny.
- Where is Chandragupta?
- You will never be able to find him.
Brother! Brother!
The real war will enhance now,
Princess.

================================================================================

Episode: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RAkYkESrSzY

Do you think
lack of food and water will
wither the bravery of a queen in me?
There is no greater fool than you,
Dhananand.
My son will turn
this festival into sorrow.
Mura, your words are useless now.
The truth is that you
are under my mercy now.
It is a joyful occasion for me.
To increase my joy, bring me madeira.
Brother!
Durdhara..
Come here, Sister..
Sister, look what I have got for you.
Other than the corpse of that boy
this woman, his mother,
is the only thing that can please you.
Soon she will die
of hunger and thirst.
Even the vultures await for her to die
and to feast on her.
We will be very happy
when Chandragupta hears
the cries of frenzy
of the vultures, right?
He will also scream to the world
that they can go against anyone
but never go against me.
Where is Chandragupta, Brother?
Durdhara,
it does not matter where he is.
I do not care about that.
His life is in my hands now.
Where is Chandragupta?
You will never be able to find him.
You will have to tell me
where Chandragupta is.
You trouble yourself too much, Sister.
I have a solution to get
answers to all your questions.
Come here.
Here..
This is no ordinary whip.
It is made with skin of alive people
who went against Magadh.
When it whips people,
they spill everything they hold.
Take it. Use it.
Everyone, encourage Princess Durdhara!
My sister is going to whip
a person for the first time.
Strike.. Your Highness,
that is her punishment..
Strike.. Your Highness,
that is her punishment..
Strike.. Your Highness,
that is her punishment..
Strike.. Your Highness,
that is her punishment..
'You all know what we
have to do and how to do it.'
Very good.. This is a great festival!
It feels as if all the festivals
are being celebrated
in Magadh at the same time.
Your Highness..
Soldiers, go and protect Her Highness!
Your Highness!
Your Majesty..
Your Majesty!
'I know that you are
somewhere around, Chandra.'
'I can feel your presence.'
Brother!
'I am sure the plan Acharya
and you have made'
'is in the best interest
of our motherland.'
'Hence, go ahead, finish your task.'
Listen to me, Your Highness.
Where could the princess go?
Who are you?
I am that prince you
were desperate to see.
The real war will start now,
princess.
Where could the princess go?
Princess..
Hey..
You? How dare you abduct me!
Listen! Brother will not spare you.
Wherever you are my brother will
find you and kill you. Understood?
Do you hear me?
Ignoring me is your mistake.
Brother's wrath will not just
destroy you but your mother as well.
My brother will finish you all.
Everyone who belongs
to Piplivan will be dead.
In fact, whoever takes your name
will be awarded with death.
You still have time.
Let me go.
Perhaps, that can save your life.
But your mother.. Nobody can save her.
Are you done bragging
about your brother?
Let alone causing harm to my mother
he will think hundred times even
before raising his finger against her.
Do you know why?
Because if he has the reason
of my life, my mother
you are with me,
who is the most valuable to him.
Your brother is smart enough
to understand
that I will treat you the way
how he is treating my mother.
So just keep quiet.
Water..
Come on! Dance harder!
Play hard! Enjoy yourselves!
Even the last drop
of the wine is over.
Now how do I enjoy myself?
You tell me.
What is her crime?
She is a traitor, Your Highness!
I didn't hear what you said.
Say it loudly.
She is a traitor, Your Highness!
She is a traitor, Your Highness..
She is a traitor, Your Highness..
Come here.
What punishment should
be given to a traitor?
Death!
Death! Death! Death!
Death! Death! Death!
- Death! Death..
- Water.
- Death! Death..
- Water.
- Bhadrasaal.
- Yes, Your Highness!
Get my bow and arrow.
Of course, Your Highness.
No! No! No, Mura..
You cannot get death so easily, Mura!
What had you said?
Yes..
You'd said that your
mighty son will compel me
to give you water with my own hands.
Those.. Those were the words,
you told me.
Mura, my hands will not
quench your thirst
but definitely they will throttle you.
Yes.
This is the only connection
between my hands and your neck.
The way I will throttle you
the impression of my fingers
will always remain on you.
And when that weakling Chandragupta
sees those marks on your neck
it will leave
a long lasting impression on him.
Stop, Your Highness!
What are you trying to tell me
by taking the flag of our enemy,
Mahamatya?
There is a news, Your Highness.
Commander Bhadrasaal,
without delay secure
the perimeter around the king!
'Dhananand, you do not have
to consider yourself brave'
'by taking my mother captive.'
'Stop being proud of yourself'
'because you made my mother
captive when she was alone.'
'But I.. In your own euphoria
and merry making'
'I have taken your sister captive.'
Durdhara.
This is musk..
A rare and expensive item.
You all must have heard
about the musk deer.
The deer is oblivious
about the asset it has
and for life it goes on to find it.
And the day comes
when it falls prey to another animal.
The people are just
like the musk deer.
They choose their king
and gives him the power.
And then, forgetting their own powers
they give in to exploitation by the king.
In such a situation,
there has to be leader
who reminds the people
that they are being exploited
and then, leads them to vanquish it.
So choose your ruler wisely.
Remember a ruler brings development
and not tyranny.
My ethics..
Your destiny.
I am eager to know how
Dhananand handles this situation.
Even I am eager, Baldev.
Chandragupta abducted the
princess in front of the king.
Hey! Water..

================================================================================

Episode: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SSWKhGcXdlw

'Yes, Dhananand.
Your sister is my prisoner.'
'So, from now on'
'you will follow my orders.'
'First, feed my mother water
in a golden cup in front of everyone.'
'Do it in front of the
subjects you humiliated her.'
'After quenching her thirst,
feed her the food she likes.'
'Present her with the attire
suitable for the Queen of Piplivan.'
'Give her the best room
in your palace for resting.'
'Perhaps, you should give her
Princess Durdhara's room'
'because it will not be of any use'
'until she is my prisoner.'
'And, yes. Do remember to
follow this message word to word.'
'If you make a mistake, your sister
will bear its consequences.'
If you think that this
will make you win the war
then I regret to say
that you are wrong.
Because this will not happen.
My brother will soon
come here and end your game.
Chandragupta.
Perhaps,
Princess Durdhara has forgotten
that she has been brought
here as a prisoner
and this is not a playground.
It would be better
for her to keep quiet.
Where? Where will you
keep me imprisoned?
I hope your plan will
be successful, Acharya.
I am eager to know how
Dhananand handles this situation.
Even I am eager, Baldev.
Especially, as this episode took place
in front of the subjects of Magadh.
The subjects
who were submissive to
Dhananand for years out of fear.
But soon,
those subjects will bear our message.
A message that will ruin
Dhananand's so-called great image.
It will create
a great problem for him.
'No one present here
should come to know'
'that Chandragupta
has kidnapped Durdhara'
'and is pressurising me.'
'Otherwise,
I, the King of Magadh, Dhananand'
'will lose face
in front of my subjects.'
'How will I face them?'
All the subjects present here..
By being present in the celebration
of my victory against my enemies
you have made it more enjoyable.
But now.. Now, it is time
to end this celebration.
Along with that, it is time
for me to abide by
the duty of humanity.
You all are thinking
why I am talking about humanity
instead of killing this woman,
the mother of our greatest enemy
by starving her?
It is because I can understand
the pain of this woman.
The princess..
- The princess has been kidnapped.
- How did this happen?
This is the message of that enemy,
Chandragupta, to King Dhananand.
Chandragupta abducted the
princess in front of the king.
That is why Mura has not been killed.
- The princess has been kidnapped.
- How did this happen?
Yes.. She has been kidnapped.
King Dhananand!
The subjects of Magadh
are not as blind
as you think them to be.
Chandragupta has determined
to make the message
that you are holding available
to every citizen of Magadh.
Now, truth is in front of everyone.
Look..
Look into their eyes.
The truth has ruined
your fake image in their eyes.
Now, they can clearly see
you and your truth as well.
Your truth is that you are a cowardly
weak and helpless king!
You could not protect your sister.
Your archenemy, Chandragupta
abducted your sister in your presence
and you could not do anything.
My son's message
is not only on this letter
but is being spoken by everyone.
And now, my son will also determine
to free them from the fear
that they have been living
under for the last 12 years!
Quiet!
Keep quiet! Otherwise..
Calm down, Your Highness.
First, we have to think
about the princess' safety.
The citizens know the truth.
If we do not follow Chandragupta's
orders, the situation can worsen.
The citizens can rebel.
Forgive me for what I am about to do.
Servant, bring water!
Make her drink water.
Stop.
King Dhananand.
My hands are paining.
Free them!
Princess Durdhara, Your Highness.
Now, I am feeling better.
But as my hands were tied
they are paining a lot
and they have weakened too.
You..
Why do you not feed me some water
King Dhananand?
'I will drink water and you
will feed it to me, Dhananand.'
'And that too, with your own hands.'
'My son,
Chandra, will make you do it.'
Use your right hand.
Who am I? The Princess of Magadh.
Will you serve me
food in a clay vessel?
Who do you think I am? Cattle?
How am I supposed to eat
and drink using clay vessels?
Perhaps, you do not
know the value of the food
that you have thrown and insulted,
Princess.
To earn this food,
every citizen of Magadh
works hard every day.
I have spent 14 years
of my life in shackles
to earn this food.
But you are not at fault here.
Because you have inherited
the art of insulting.
Your brother insults people's lives
and you disrespect food.
Food? Is this food?
Even dogs do not eat
food like this in Magadh.
That food was for me.
I gave it to you as I am
habitual of going hungry.
But what to do?
The one who does not know the
difference between humans and dogs
how can she differentiate
between the people of Magadh?
One Roti is remaining.
I am keeping it here.
Perhaps, your hunger will
make you realise its value.
You cannot keep me captive,
Chandragupta.
Soon, I will escape from here.
I wonder if my sister
has eaten anything or not.
I wonder how she is.
It seems that you are not concerned
about my sister's condition at all.
Until I find my sister safely
no one will eat anything.
Leave!
Forgive me, Your Highness
but alerting the soldiers
can endanger Princess Durdhara.
According to me, we should wait
for Chandragupta's next message.
That would be better, Your Highness.
I cannot wait for the
message of the traitors
without doing anything,
Amatya Rakshas.
I am the King of Magadh!
I can find my sister on my own.
- Did you hear me?
- Yes, Your Highness.
Hail the King!
Your Highness Chandragupta
has sent a message for you.
'Dhananand, I am ready to give
your sister in exchange for my mother.
'Tomorrow,
at sunrise come to Mount Tripund'
'without any army and free
my mother to take your sister.'
'But do remember.'
'If you employ deceit you
can lose your sister forever.'
'We will meet tomorrow at sunrise.
Chandragupta.'
He has forbidden to bring an army.
Amatya Rakshas,
go and stop our army from mobilising.
- Go!
- As you say, Your Highness.
Come on, Bhadrasaal.
You are soaring too high,
Chandragupta.
Soon, I will clip
your wings!
I hope we are clear
about tomorrow's plan.
Tomorrow, at sunrise
my mother and Durdhara
will be exchanged.
What if our plan fails?
Will we leave the queen to die?
Even I have the same question,
Acharya.
You can sacrifice anyone to
fulfill your dream of united India!
It does not matter
if it is our queen, Mura.
Baldev, you are so angry
that you will not be able
to understand my motive.
I have already made it clear
why it was important for Queen Mura
to be imprisoned according to my plan.
Acharya, the question is
not about the success of a plan.
Our queen's life is in danger.
All the Kshatriyas present here
will never want to
endanger the queen's life.
All right.
If you have another plan, do tell me.
I will listen to it
Calm down.
We do not have any other
option than following this plan.
because my mother does
not have any other options.
I will make sure
to bring my mother back
in exchange for Durdhara.
That too, safely.
I apologise for Baldev's
behaviour, Acharya.
No, Chandragupta. I am not angry.
If their unwavering loyalty
and faith is towards Queen Mura
the symbol of Kshatriya
valour and dignity
then no one will be happier than me.
'I hope that my mother is all right.'
Your Highness!
I apologise for asking this question.
Will you really follow the
orders of that traitor, Chandragupta?
My sister, Durdhara,
is concerned here.
My dear sister has
been abducted by that boy.
When did you sustain this wound?
Treat all her wounds at once.
Apply the medicine
on this leg as well.
Please apply it.
Your Highness, rest assured.
Everything is fine.
She is completely fine.
The food is kept there. Have it.
What could all this mean?
Yes!
You people are making sure that
my body has not sustained any wound.
Because if my son, Chandragupta,
sees a wound on my person
its result would reflect on your
dear sister, Durdhara, right?
It means I will soon
be free from here.
It means your arrogance
is going to break.
And it means that the shining
empire of King Dhananand
is soon going to succumb
to my son's wrath.
This ordinary toy has a speciality.
No matter the direction
you throw it at
it returns to you.
The results of the deeds
of humans are akin to this toy.
It returns to them
as a result of their deeds
in some way, some form
and somewhere.
So, if you have done good deeds
then the results will reward you.
And bad deeds will always
give you pain like a punishment.
So, it is important
to keep your deeds in check.
My ethics..
Your destiny.
Princess, don't you worry.
I'll ensure your safety.
Durdhara has escaped.
We will have to capture
Durdhara at any cost.
Otherwise Dhananand will
never release Princes Mura.

================================================================================

Episode: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7u7KjyO9nQ

'I'll have to somehow escape
from here and reach my brother.'
Princes, Durdhara!
Where is this smoke coming from?
Princess!
Princes, Durdhara!
Princes!
Go and get some water.
You, inform Chandragupta immediately.
Hurry up. Go..
Princess, don't you worry.
I'll ensure your safety.
You are very important to us.
Princes!
Forgive me, Chandragupta.
I felt that Princess' is in danger.
But she was just pretending
to be unconscious.
She betrayed us, Chandra. Betrayed us.
She must have definitely
gone through the forest.
Inform Chanakya immediately.
We will have to capture
Durdhara at any cost.
Otherwise Dhananand will
never release Princes Mura.
Emperor!
Chandragupta had specified that
the exchange will happen at sunrise
then why did we decide
to go there at night?
Anyways, I couldn't have slept
due to sister's concern, Amatya.
I don't know why but I feel that
I will feel closer to my sister
by reaching the destination.
I understood, My Lord. Go.
Let us wait here until sunrise,
My Lord.
Where is my dear sister?
I am not too far from Magadh.
But I don't have much time.
Magadha's flag!
It means I am not far from my brother.
Oh, God!
Brother!
Brother!
Brother!
She called me.
Who called, Emperor?
Who else, I mean my sister. You fool.
I heard her voice just now.
Brother!
No, My Lord.
All of us are over here.
None of us heard any voice.
Maybe it is your illusion, My Lord.
It is not my illusion.
I heard my sister's voice.
From there..
From the direction of the river.
Bhadrasaal, stay alert.
I will accompany the Emperor.
Okay, Amatya.
Get away from me.
- Get away, right now.
- Calm down.
Calm down and listen to me carefully.
Anyways, I was about to
hand you over to your brother.
Then what was the
need for you to do so?
Had something happened to you,
what then?
How come you are
worried about my life?
According to you,
I am just an object, right?
A means to accomplish your goal.
Am I not just a pawn
in your useless war?
No! I have always protected you.
No matter how you treated me
but I never wanted to hurt you.
Neither at the time
when I was your servant
nor now.
I did all this to save your life.
Don't try to trick me
into some sweet talk, Chandra.
My brother will be here soon.
He will capture all
of you and kill you.
It seems that you could not find out
your brother's true nature till now.
Nobody else understands
my brother better than me.
Yes of course, he is a little cruel,
little rude and arrogant.
But he has to be so to
deal with traitors like you.
Your brother is multifaceted.
Among them is one which
is unknown from you.
The mask of a liar.
The mask of a murderer.
The mask which has the
murder of your family member.
- What?
- Do you think
your father lost his life
in your beloved brother's arms?
No!
The truth is that your beloved
brother's arms strangulated
your father,
Emperor Mahapadmanand to death.
He strangulated him
until he breathed his last.
Yes, Princess. It was your
beloved brother Emperor Dhananand
who murdered your father.
He hid this truth from you.
Enough! Enough!
How dare you talk like
this about my brother and father?
These are not my words, Princes.
He confessed about it.
Is all this Dad's curse?'
'I had strangulated him in my arms.'
It is your beloved brother,
Emperor Dhananand
who murdered your father
and hid this from you till now.
No. This cannot be true.
You are lying.
Whether you accept
it or do not accept it
the truth will always
remain the truth, Princess.
Excuse me, Your Highness.
I searched for the princess
on the bank of river.
But she is not found.
But do not worry.
But your worries will
be over after the sunrise
when the slave will
come here with the princess
for the exchange.
Chandragupta said that
he will come here with my sister
immediately after the sunrise
Where is he?
Why is he taking so long?
Delaying tactic is
the part of Chandragupta
and Chanakya's plan for sure
in order to trouble you.
But do not worry.
They can reach here anytime.
And our best archer is on his toes
if they try to act smart.
He will attack them immediately.
Please do not worry.
Amatya Rakshas, have you heard the sound
of footsteps?
That means, my sister will be..
How come these people have come here?
How did they get to
know about the exchange?
It must be Chandragupta's trick.
He forced you to feed Mura
water in front of the subjects.
Similarly,
he wants to execute this deal
in front of the subjects
in order to embarrass you.
Once..
Once I get my sister back.
After that, just wait and watch
how I will make the
lives of Chandragupta
and his sympathisers miserable.
I will change my name
if Chandragupta does not lose respect in the eyes of people
who consider him a hero.
He will get a befitting reply
from Magadh for his audacity.
But my sister is my priority now.
Nothing else is my priority.
Indra, it is strange.
Her mouth is not tied
with a piece of cloth.
- Even then she is so quiet.
- Yes.
Chandragupta must have
given her a piece of advice.
That is the reason she is quiet.
Yes, Indra.
It seems whatever Chandra
told her has touched her heart.
- And..
- Silence.
Keep quiet.
Your Highness, princess..
My sister.
'Do you think that your father'
'breathed his last in
the arms of your brother? No!'
'The stark truth is that your brother'
'throttled your father
King Padmanand till he lay dead!'
'Dhananand had
throttled him to death.'
Mura.
It seems that the false courage
of your coward son has also left him.
That is the reason he is not here.
I am here, Dhananand.
My courage has not left me, Dhananand.
In fact, I have come here
to prove my utmost courage!
Chandragupta, your overconfidence
will make things
easy for me to kill you!
Release my sister!
Until you free my mother,
Durdhara will remain captive.
My mother takes a step forward
and then your sister
takes a step forward.
Such audacity
that you will dictate
terms to the King of Magadh!
Dhananand, today, neither
you are a king nor I am a traitor.
Both of us stands
at the same juncture.
If you have held our queen captive
then even we have held
captive the princess of Magadh!
When the queen takes a step forward
only then the princess of
Magadh will take a step forward.
Or else this exchange
will not take place!
Amazing! This is sheer courage.
That boy is a true warrior.
You are right.
For the first time,
I have seen someone
who can challenge the emperor head on
and that too, confront like a king.
Keep your anger at control,
Your Highness.
Once we get back the princess unharmed
then we will deal harshly
with each one of them.
Just like the light of the moon
the waves of this sea
tends to increase or decrease.
The intensity of the tide
depends on the moon which is far away.
That moon which cannot
be seen during the day
but still it has control
over the waves of the sea.
The same way if you
want to attain a goal
then it is not important
that you should be there in person.
Most of the time,
your aura and positive attitude
is more than enough
to have a task completed.
Remember if your intention
and loyalty is genuine
then like the moon
even you can control
everything at a distance
and get to your goal.
My ethics..
Your destiny.
The only thing we have left
are the dead bodies of our men.
And they are thousands in numbers.
We don't have any army or weapons
but we do have something
that never fails.
Courage and glory..
'The straw or the storm
who will win this great battle.'

================================================================================

Episode: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6D69XBNZwM

Dhananand, you have our queen
and we have the queen of Magadh.
The queen of Magadh will take a step
when our queen takes a step.
Otherwise, this would not happen!
What will he do now..
What will be his decision..
What will he do now..
What will be his decision..
Go.
'What do you think?'
'Do you think that your father died
in the arms of your brother? 'No!'
'The truth is, your brother'
'killed your father,
Emperor Mahapadmanand.'
'Dhananand strangled
your father to death.'
Chief Advisor.
Durdhara does not seem
happy about getting freed.
She is so calm.
Do not worry, Your Majesty.
The princess was
imprisoned by the enemy.
Maybe, that is why her
mental health does not seem fine.
I hope, you will not
be like your brother.
I saw a part of your personality
that was not affected
by your brother.
Come fast, sister. Come fast.
Run, Your Highness! Run!
Princess!
Archers!
Wait! Fools!
He has my sister.
Catch them!
Let me go!
You have deceived them. Leave me!
Durdhara..
'That is how the sun of the
Lord of Magadh began to be eclipsed'
'by the moon of the Maurya dynasty,
Chandragupta.'
'Dhananand could not
do anything as long as'
'Princess Durdhara was
imprisoned by Chandragupta.'
'This was the first
time that Dhananand'
'did not have
a solution to a problem.'
'The King of Magadh,
Dhananand was helpless'
'and was unable to do anything.'
'Durdhara was also struggling
with a strange problem.'
'She used to ask herself every day'
'who was right and
who was wrong in this war.'
'Dhananand used his entire
army to find Chandragupta.'
'But he found no clue'
'because Magadh's army had
less effect on the people now.'
'It seemed like Princess Durdhara
also started to understand'
'Chandragupta and Chanakya's
main goal of their revolution.'
'Durdhara accepted
her fate as time passed.'
Chandragupta.
I apologise for
interrupting your meeting.
I just wanted to say,
I either sit in my cave all day
or see you prepare for war.
Chandragupta,
you know that I like painting.
If you permit, can I paint?
Okay.
But remember,
we will always keep an eye on you.
Thank you.
Do not worry about the
materials needed for painting.
I will make paints and paintbrushes
with flowers and grass.
'Dhananand's fear became
lesser in the minds'
'of his subjects
because of his failure'
'to find his sister'
'and because Chandragupta
imprisoned her.'
'The people refused
to pay their taxes.'
'The number of empty
trunks started increasing.'
'The subjects started discussing'
'that perhaps the mightiness'
'and immense personality
they have had imagined'
'was an illusion and
that only a brave and just'
'person like Chandragupta Maurya
can start a new era in Magadh.'
'The people of Magadh
started getting hopeful.'
'They started believing that someday'
'that Chandragupta's flag
would wave on the palace.'
'And that Dhananand's
cruel reign will end.'
Hail King Chandragupta!
Hail King Chandragupta!
'But fate had something
else in store for them.'
Your Majesty.
My spies found many
such vessels from areas
outside Pataliputra filled
with colours like this.
Colours?
My sister loves to paint.
She is giving us clues
so that we can find her
and free her.
You are right.
We had started to follow
the source of this colour.
But unfortunately, I found nothing.
Neither a sign nor a proof.
that can take us to the princess.
I know where the princess is,
Your Majesty.
Emperor!
Many times I have seen
Princess using these colours.
I cannot forget it.
This is a rare colour.
Which can be made only
with one type of flower.
These type of flowers are found
near the forests around Hawa Mahal.
Which means, Chandragupta
wants to conquer Hawa Mahal.
We will attack Hawa Mahal tomorrow,
at sunrise.
Hawa Mahal is an important
benchmark for us.
If we are able to establish
our ownership over here
we can establish
our army base over here.
We can train the army for war.
If Hawa Mahal goes into
the hands of Piplivan army
it will increase
Chandragupta's confidence.
We will lose one important spot.
Hawa Mahal's conquest will
be a big blow to Dhananand.
We have the support of 50 villages.
The flame of revolt is ignited.
Gradually, Dhananand's fear
is reducing among the civilians.
Hawa Mahal's conquest
will increase
the civilians trust on us.
It will be encouraging for us.
Yes, they can foresee a bright future.
Chandragupta doesn't know
that the assurances that he is
giving them about their bright future
is going to be scattered soon.
I will not allow Chandragupta's
and the civilian's dreams
to turn into reality.
Tomorrow morning at dawn
when most of the soldiers
will be in a sleepy mode
we will take advantage of
their lazy mood and attack suddenly.
To establish our hold on Hawa Mahal.
Your Majesty
all the arrangements have been made.
Tonight, victory shall be ours.
Hey, Chandra! Be careful, it is us.
Chanakya always mentions
a little rest increases our
capacity to fight for long hours.
Look at him, he is practicing
continuously without rest.
Good. Very good.
Yes, Chandragupta!
Tomorrow morning, we have
an important target to be achieved
to have Piplivan's flag
hoisted on Hawa Mahal.
I feel you should rest
for some time before sunrise.
I do know it.
But something is bothering me.
Something strange is occurring.
But I am unable to see it.
Oh! I know what is the strange
thing which is disturbing you.
It is Princess Durdhara's
humble behaviour
to which you are unable
to show your courtesy.
That is the thing,
Chandra, that is bothering you.
As you know, you are not responding
to Princess' smile with a smile.
- What?
- Yes, even I agree to his words.
The Princess has made a lot
of changes in her behaviour, Chandra.
Now, Durdhara is not the
arrogant and stubborn princess
which she was when we brought
her for the first time as a prisoner.
- Right?
- Yes, Indra.
Chandra, she accepts the ordinary food
or the inconvenience
of shifting places daily.
The Princess who has lived
her entire life on her terms
to transform so much,
is a great achievement, Chandra.
But you have not been humble to her.
I couldn't be humble to her
yet because I don't trust her yet.
To adjust to the situation
is not Durdhara's nature, Stul.
Forget all that.
Let us get some rest
so that we could be fresh tomorrow
morning to be alert and cautious.
Let's go.
This is Princess,
colour palette, right?
Yes, she was painting over here.
She is a Princess,
and it's here nature to do so.
- Very true.
- Yes.
Wherever she does her painting,
she leaves these pots there.
D-Does she do it regularly?
Does she leave these pots at the
places where she does her paintings?
Yes!
Alert everybody at once.
Because it is not Princess's nature
but an indication of oncoming danger.
Let's go.
It is hard to believe
that in spite of
such strenuous efforts
it is this simple pot which
is helping us trace my sister.
- Amatya.
- Yes, Emperor.
Alert our soldiers to
spread around Hawa Mahal.
But keep in mind that
they should be in hiding.
Chandragupta should not be
able to find out about their presence.
When they attack Hawa Mahal
they should feel that they have
established their hold on Hawa Mahal.
I don't want Chandragupta
to know about my presence
when we capture him.
For every single of his soldiers
arrange for 100 soldiers of ours.
Let's surround them like
a rodent and crush them.
I will concentrate my full energy
to free my sister,
Durdhara from their clutches.
Sure, My Lord.
Your orders will be followed.
You will always find yourself
in a winning situation, My Lord.
I may be incorrect in my guess.
But Durdhara's deliberately
leaving pots at various places
could be a secret
message to Dhananand.
Dhananand could trace us
by analysing these pots.
Chandra, unnecessarily you
are worrying for a trivial matter.
No Stulbhadra.
Underestimating our Army Chief's doubt
can be a grave error.
May be his guess may not be correct.
Just in case, if his doubt is true,
all of us are in trouble.
At the point where we
are assuming to be victorious
the enemy could be moving
towards us to attack us.
If Chandragupta's guess
turns out to be correct
then Dhananand and his army
would definitely try
to analyse Durdhara's hints.
We do not have time to spare.
We have to attack Hawa Mahal at once.
Indra and Stulbhadra
both of you take Durdhara
to the mangled remains of the temple.
I will let you know
once we capture Hawa Mahal.
You can come there
with Durdhara after that.
My comrades, get ready for the battle.
Soon Hawa Mahal will be ours.
May the enemy be defeated.
Let my country be
united and victorious.
This battle got over much
easier than expected, Queen.
You are right, Chanakya.
We have finished the enemy soldiers.
Hawa Mahal is now ours.
But we still have
to be careful, Baldev.
If anyone notices anything suspicious
inform everyone know.
Chanakya
it seems like a storm
is headed our way.
Your Majesty, Chandragupta!
Chandra!
What are you two doing here?
You were tasked with
the princess' protection.
How come you are injured?
Chandra.. Durdhara did this, Chandra.
Yes, Chandra. You were right.
She is not trustworthy.
She pretended to support us
and betrayed us.
She took Indra's knife
attacked the two of us and ran away.
She has gone to Dhananand's army,
Chandra.
We have to stop her soon.
Or else it will be bad.
How will you catch her, though?
I know what I have to
do with Durdhara, Acharya.
Prepare to close all the
main entrances of Hawa Mahal.
I will follow her.
She could not have gone too far.
Did you think I am a foolish princess
who would get influenced by your words
and accept to become your prisoner?
No.
I planned this to distract you people.
Just wait and watch.
My brother will be here soon
and kill you all!
So it is no use to take
a prisoner again, Chandragupta.
- Let go of me!
- I had hoped that my suspicion
that you were the one
sending messages to Dhananand
would turn out to be false.
I had hoped
that you would know what is right.
But no! I was wrong.
So listen to me carefully.
I am not here to take you prisoner.
Yes, that is right.
I have taken control of Hawa Mahal.
If I so wish, I can take you with me
and make you a prisoner again but no.
I will not do that.
Those who have lost
their way could be guided.
But those who do not accept
that they have lost their way
cannot be guided, Durdhara.
You planned this to get your brother
even though I showed
you how wicked your brother is
and told you the truth that
he is the one who killed your father.
You did not want to accept it.
I am sure you still do not realise
that your brother is a demon.
All right then.
Go to your brother.
Keep this in mind, Durdhara.
When you find out
about your father's death
you will then know about me.
And then you will understand
why I am trying to save
my motherland from your brother.
Brother!
Amatya, is it an illusion again
or did I really hear Durdhara's voice?
It is not an illusion,
Your Majesty, but reality.
Look over there.
Sister..
You.. Are you all right?
I feel as if I am alive again!
That blood runs through my veins again!
That I am able to breathe again!
- Are you all right?
- Yes, Brother, I am all right.
- Did they harass you?
- No, Brother.
They have not harmed me.
- But..
- But.. What?
But Chandragupta and his
army has conquered Hawa Mahal.
Conquered Hawa Mahal?
How many Kshatriyas are there,
Your Highness?
Around 100 Kshatriyas, Amatya Rakshas.
Your Majesty, just 100 soldiers.
We can defeat them easily.
They will not last much
longer against our huge army.
Just give the order
to attack Hawa Mahal.
Sister, just wait and watch
how I punish those traitors.
They have made the biggest mistake
of their lives by kidnapping you.
Amatya, I want this sunrise
to be the last one for
those traitors and Chandragupta!
It will be so, Your Majesty.
Soldiers, advance
and surround Hawa Mahal.
Be quick!
Baldev, the numbers.
Five.. Seven..
There might even be
10,000 soldiers, Acharya.
It does not matter.
Even if Dhananand brings
100 thousand soldiers
he will not be able
to do anything to us.
It is because soon Chandra will capture
Durdhara and take her captive again.
I let her go.
- What did you just say?
- Yes, Acharya.
I let her go.
Despite knowing
that Dhananand has
followed us till here
by following the messages
Durdhara left behind.
Right now,
when we are having this discussion
Dhananand has surrounded us
completely, Chandragupta.
In this situation,
why did you let Durdhara go?
Yes, Acharya. I let her leave.
Our only reason to keep her captive
was to make the citizens of Magadh
fearless towards Dhananand.
We have succeeded
in attaining our goal.
The citizens have started
to trust our capabilities and us.
If we use Durdhara as
a shield against Dhananand
then we will lose the
trust of the citizens.
What will they think about us?
That is why I did not recapture her
and allowed her to go to Dhananand.
I support Chandragupta's decision.
Only cowards use a woman
as a shield in a battle.
Just like once Dhananand
use me as a bait.
'Stop, king Chandravardhan.'
'Otherwise your dear
wife will lose her life.'
'My Lord!'
Then how will we escape from here?
We have a difficult
challenge before us.
We have to find a way to
leave this palace at any cost.
Until we do that
we have to stop Dhananand
and his army outside the palace.
Acharya, we have been surrounded.
How can we escape safely?
When the flood water starts
to rise from all the directions
then mice burrow deep
into the land for safety.
We will employ the same strategy.
We will dig a deep tunnel that
will take us away from this palace.
But, Acharya, this palace
is built on a rocky mountain.
It will be difficult to tunnel here.
We do not have another option.
In difficult situations
the ones with great will-power
face their problems with courage.
- We will do the same.
- Yes, Acharya.
I agree with my mother.
We will face this problem.
But first, we have to safeguard
all the door of this palace.
Come on.
Your Highness
they have closed all
the doors of the Hawa Mahal.
It is all right, Amatya Rakshas.
How long can those insignificant
beings protect their lives?
It is their fate to
be trampled upon by me.
How long can their dwindling army
fight my great army?
Let them close all
the doors they want.
They can postpone their death
but they cannot escape it.
Today..
Today, I will kill Chandragupta.
Great!
Princess!
The battle can start at any moment.
Please go to the
palace with Bhadrasaal.
No. I will not leave.
I will stay here with all of you.
She is my sister, Amatya Rakshas.
She is my reflection.
She is as eager as I am
to see Chandragupta die.
My sister can stay here
as long as she wants.
As you say, Your Highness.
But, Princess,
please go to the camp with Bhadrasaal.
What am I seeing, Brother?
Food is the most important
thing in your life.
What are you doing here
as a warrior on this battlefield?
I am here to prove my loyalty to you.
Chandragupta's rebellion
had started from the Hawa Mahal.
He had fooled me and
left to fight against you.
'This is not the time for
questioning but to be alert.'
'Someone has breached our security.'
'I think the man I saw was Baldev.'
'I think he is plotting against us.'
'I will go and check.'
Again, he is hiding here.
That is why I am here.
I want to rectify my mistake
and help you in killing Chandragupta.
So, will you help me, King Dhananand,
against the one who once made
a fool out of you, Brother Govi?
By the way, I am happy.
Perhaps, after witnessing
my prowess in battle
you will forget about food
and start showing a bit
of interest in the art of warfare.
What is your plan, Your Highness?
If you want to listen to it
then do pay attention.
I will exact my revenge against
Chandragupta for humiliating me
in front of all my subjects.
I will publicly kill that boy
so that the scene of his death
is etched on the memories
of my subjects forever.
If I put this poison
in different vessels
will it reduce its lethality?
No.
In any form or shape
it will not lose its lethality.
A cunning person
is akin to this poison.
He does not lose his lethal touch
irrespective of the
company or situation.
So, remember..
Do not be beguiled by
a cunning person's facade.
And always be alert.
Otherwise, your trust in
them can turn detrimental for you.
This poison has only one nature.
It is lethal.
My ethics..
Your destiny.
The only thing we have left
are the dead bodies of our men.
And they are thousands in numbers.
We don't have any army or weapons
but we do have something
that never fails.
Courage and glory..
'The straw or the storm
who will win this great battle.'

Episode: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4FMc179jwI

To enter the inner
portion of Hawa Mahal
Magadh army will have to pass
these three main entrances.
Entrance one, entrance two and,
the most important entrance
entrance number three.
Before they get to the third entrance
we will have to have our tunnel ready.
Acharya, how long do you think
it will take us to make the tunnel?
At least three days.
In those three days,
we will have to make sure
that Dhananand and the Magadh army
does not enter Hawa Mahal.
And that will only be possible
when the fortification of
these three entrances is strong.
We have to make sure
that the army of Magadh
works hard to enter Hawa Maha
so that we get as much time
as we can get to make the tunnel.
Acharya..
We to divide ourselves in various
groups and accomplish our jobs.
Chandra, you and Baldev
will fortify the main entrance.
If they are going to
fortify the main entrance
Indra, I and some kshatriya soldiers
will fortify the other two entrances.
Acharya, Stulbhadra and
I will begin digging of tunnel.
But General Matsaldev, you..
Dhananand might have removed my leg
but that fool was not
able to take my will power.
And the immortal soul
that gives power to my arms
to defeat him.
I can dig faster than 10 men together.
Let us defeat the enemy..
Let us form the united Bharat..
Your Majesty,
the traitors can try all they want.
The bridge is almost complete.
Using the battering ram
we will break
the main gate of Hawa Mahal.
Once the main gate is broken
it will not be much difficult for
our army to break the other two gates.
And then we will have victory.
Magadh will be solely victorious.
Good! Very good!
The soil is damp.
This will be the
appropriate spot to dig.
We will create a tunnel
that will go on the other side
of that wall and protect us.
Let us begin quickly.
Quickly! Magadh army would
have completed the bridge by now!
We do not have much time!
We will have to fortify this gate more
or else they will soon break in!
Soldiers, get all the heavy
objects of the palace quickly! Go!
Soldiers..
Why have the Magadh soldiers
stopped breaking in?
This is surely a plan of Dhananand's.
Be ready soldiers.
What sort of sound is that?
Dhananand is definitely
going to make an announcement.
Soldiers, fortify this entrance more!
We will be back soon!
Come on, Baldev!
Welcome..
Welcome to all the Magadh citizens!
I have called you here
to watch a panoramic scene.
You all had given your support
to that traitorous boy.
You have taken him for your saviour.
You even refused to pay me taxes
because he said so.
Today, you all will come to know
that you made a big mistake
by trusting that cockroach!
You all will become
the witness to the truth
that Chandragupta is not a messiah
sent by God
but he belongs right under the feet
of your mighty king Dhananand.
So
today, when I will kill Chandragupta
then not only he but your false hopes
and expectations will die with him.
Chandragupta!
Carefully sees these villagers.
They are the same
villagers whom you trusted
and dreamt to vanquish me.
King Dhananand!
Yes!
They are the same villagers
from those fifty villages
whom you took them by your side.
And now..
They will witness your death!
And that death..
That death will be so dreadful..
It will be so dreadful
that not only through the years
but even their descendants
will remember it.
And then these oppressed people
will never ever rebel against me.
Did you hear me?
Stop digging the tunnel.
We will not dig the tunnel and escape.
In fact, I will be here and fight him.
What is going on in your mind,
Chandragupta?
Acharya..
We will not dig the tunnel and escape.
In fact, I will be here and fight him.
That is because if
I dig the tunnel and escape
then I will not die but
my ideology will definitely die..
That ideology for which I spent so much
time and effort to motivate my men.
To kill that ideology, Dhananand
has brought the people of Magadh here.
And if I retreat, then that ideology
on which the people
of Magadh are relying on
that there is someone who
can protest Dhananand's tyranny..
There is someone who can put
an end to the cruel ways of Dhananand
and inculcate a new ideology.
Acharya, that ideology will die
if I do not fight.
The feeling of patriotism
and the love of the country
which I had sown in their hearts
that hope will die
and Dhananand will win..
His fear will win.
And then, under his rule
all these people
will live a cruel life.
All our efforts and strategy
will go in vain, Acharya.
And I will not let that happen.
Chandra is right, Acharya.
We will fight.
We might go down fighting
but our ideology and bravery
will live on in the
hearts of the people.
We will fight till death!
Yes, Acharya!
It can also be possible
that if we win in
such a grim situation
then we will be able to crush
the ideology of Dhananand forever.
The promise of a warrior mother
and her brave son
is very praiseworthy.
The reality is that we
and our handful of soldiers
will not be able to sustain
against the massive army of Dhananand.
Chandragupta
I stand by each and
every word of yours
but at this moment, we need to know
that the future is carved
out from the present.
And for the future of India
it is important to you stay alive.
Acharya, at this moment,
I'm not thinking of the future
but the present.
And even we should
think of the present.
That is because today
will lead to tomorrow.
So I am ready
to fight Dhananand and his army.
It makes no difference to me
the size of the army Dhananand
has because I believe
that each soldier of mine
has the power of a hundred soldiers.
We are ready to challenge them.
Acharya..
You have made me
a warrior from a servant.
And a warrior
can never run away
from the battlefield.
Let us defeat the enemy..
Let us form the united Bharat..
Let us defeat the enemy..
Let us form the united Bharat..
Chandragupta,
whenever I think I have understood you
you surprise me.
My favourite and stubborn disciple.
So, you are with us, Acharya.
Have you left me
with any other option?
I am definitely with you.
And that is because
if anybody has the capability
to defeat Dhananand
it is only you, Chandragupta.
But I will not stop the
work of digging the tunnel
because according to my strategy
we should have a second option.
It is time to show our
capability to Dhananand.
Let us go.
Look at that, people of Magadh.
Look carefully
how I will destroy the weak
security of these traitors
and Chandragupta's courage.
This door will be opened
in few minutes and with that
that traitor's courage
will be destroyed.
We will not be able to withstand
this continuous attack anymore.
This door will be destroyed very soon.
Today, all of you will become witnesses
to the cruel end of Chandragupta.
And all of you will see
how he has invited
his death by challenging
Dhananand, the king of Magadh
and by going against me.
Acharya, I hope
Chandragupta's plan succeeds.
It will undoubtedly succeed.
Hurry up. We will have to throw these
oil drums into the ditch quickly.
All of you get ready.
Few moments are left.
You will watch
the end of that traitor then.
Dhananand!
Amazing!
Chandragupta has caused a huge damage
to the vast army
of the king in one shot.
I had heard stories
of his bravery so far.
But I witnessed it live today.
Dhananand.
The people whom you have
called to witness my end today
will witness
how an army of 100 soldiers
will destroy the false
pride of an egoistic king.
Dhananand, today, your identity
and pride will be destroyed.
Come, attack me.
I will be standing here and facing you
and your entire army.
History is a witness.
Whenever a war has taken place
people only remember
the one who emerged victorious
and not the one who was defeated.
And the names of the king
and the kingdom who won the war
is written in golden words in history.
But..
No one remembers the sacrifice
of those brave warriors
whose lay down their
lives for this victory.
Give huge respect to every soldier
because your life has been protected
by the blood of a soldier.
My ethics..
Your destiny.
The only thing we have left
are the dead bodies of our men.
And they are thousands in numbers.
We don't have any army or weapons
but we do have something
that never fails.
Courage and glory..
'The straw or the storm
who will win this great battle.'

================================================================================

Episode: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YmtQV_epuc0

Dhananand, today, your identity
and pride will be destroyed.
Come on, attack me.
I will be standing here
and facing you and your entire army.
No matter how much you try
you will never be able
to change my ideology.
You will never be able
to harm that patriotism
which my soldiers and I have
instilled in the people of Magadh.
And now, you will see
how my army is capable
of revolting you.
Today, I will make
sure I eliminate you.
If you still do not believe
I will show you such a sight
which you will
never be able to forget.
Take a look, Dhananand.
Look at this flag of Peplivan.
You will neither
be able to put this down
nor will you be able
to change my ideology.
Attack..
My ideology will win over your army.
And this victory will give
rise to a wave of revolution
in the whole Bharat.
Never in my whole life I even imagined
that we would see any other flag
flying high before
the flag of Dhananand.
Chandragupta is indeed great.
Chandragupta
the more crimes you commit
the more painful your death will be.
Today, I will make sure
I put an end to this.
Your comrades hiding in the palace
will very soon get to know
that none of them will
come out from it alive.
What you are doing now
is sheer foolishness.
It's a suicide.
You will be a reason for
the death of all your comrades.
And then
I will give you a horrible death.
Brother Govi
it is time for you to
prove yourself before me.
Go, bring that poison
which was made on my orders.
The smoke of which kills
a person in no time.
Make our archer ready
and give them this arrows
dipped in that poison.
Dhananand will not accept
his defeat so easily.
Today, Chandragupta has humiliated him
before his people.
He has hurt his ego.
When someone does that
to a person like Dhananand
they become more
desperate to retaliate.
Even Dhananand will do the same.
That too, very soon.
But, Acharya
how do we stop him?
Except for a hundred
soldiers and a few weapons
we have nothing.
We have one special weapon.
Look at these waving curtains.
Indra
what weapon can we
make out of these curtains?
Stul, just think what
these curtains can do.
They are burnable materials.
Especially, these silk curtains.
Very good, Indra.
I know that we do not
have enough weapons
or the bows and arrows.
But we have something more powerful
which is our mind.
We can turn even curtains into weapons
and face the enemies.
Indra, this is your plan.
Now tell us what we should do.
Direct us.
Just wait and watch.
I will create such a magic out of them
that it will destroy
his soldiers in no time.
How long will it take, Govi?
In a while.
Hurry up.
Every minute that
Chandragupta's death is delayed
feels to me as though
it's my own death.
Hawa Mahal looks different.
Something is missing.
I am not able to make
out what is missing.
Curtains!
Curtains?
Yes, Brother.
The curtains are missing.
They have removed all
the curtains of the palace.
The special and unique curtains
which you got from Persia.
What will they do with the curtains?
Dear Brother!
Those curtains have two specialities.
The first feature is they
are extremely light weight.
The second feature is that
they are highly inflammable.
Amatya
try to analyse the speed
of the Eastern direction.
It will help you understand
the enemy's next move.
I understood, My Lord.
I will send a unit of soldiers
to the Eastern side.
Chandragupta has invited
his doom by burning our flag.
No matter how effective your plan is,
Chandragupta
but I think one step ahead of you.
Wait and watch how I will
surround you from all directions
and arrest even your breath.
My Lord, I have sent one
unit of the army in North direction.
One fourth of our
army is ready to attack
at the front of the palace.
Dhananand!
Get ready!
Attack!
Your plan was successful, Indra.
Really, Indra. Your plan was amazing.
We reduced their
army from 1200 to 700.
It looks like the future emperor
has found his future army chief.
There's still a long
way for that, Baldev.
But we are brothers first,
which we will continue to be.
Amazing! Superb plan.
Due to lack of weapons,
they turned the curtains to weapons.
Superb! Fantastic.
What will the Emperor do?
Silence!
How dare you people praise the enemy
in the presence of Emperor, Dhananand.
Keep quiet.
Please calm down, Amatya.
Chandragupta may be happy to hear
the praise of these ordinary people.
Let him enjoy the victory of
his petty and false victory.
This will be beneficial to us
because the enemy will lose focus
from our attack due to this.
Brother, Govi!
Get your archers ready to attack
from the Southern side of the palace.
My Lord, our unit at the Northern
direction will be ready as well.
Why is a unit of the army proceeding
towards the Northern direction?
What happened, Chanakya?
This is the first time you stopped
since we started digging the tunnel.
- What's the matter?
- Yes, Stulbhadra!
What is the idea behind sending an
army unit towards the Northern side?
What may be the
intention of this move?
'It means Dhananand
has planned to surround us'
'even from the Northern
side and attack us.'
I understood.
I will have to go and inform
Chandragupta immediately.
Continue digging the tunnel till then.
Acharya, is he in trouble?
Stulbhadra, remember one thing.
A victory is possible in any war
when every soldier
focuses on his target.
Now, your target is not Chandragupta
but digging that tunnel.
Continue digging.
Attack!
This arrow?
This is not an ordinary arrow.
I have never seen such an arrow.
Stop, Queen!
Nobody will touch these
arrows shot by the enemy.
I want to examine them.
All these arrows shot
by the enemy are poisonous.
This portion contains poison.
When this portion burns,
it will spread a poisonous smoke
which will kill all of us.
Nobody will touch this
portion of the arrows.
Pick it up and throw
it back at the Magadha army.
Chandragupta, Dhananand has planned to
attack from the north direction too.
You handle the situation here.
I will go down and restart
the digging of the tunnel.
Okay, Acharya.
Dhananand sacrificed his army
so that he can distract us
and so that we cannot
guess the upcoming problem.
Sumant, you are attaining martyrdom
in this battle for freedom.
Thank you very much from the
upcoming generations and all of us.
They will have to bear
the outcome of this now.
Your Majesty,
this plan of ours is also failing.
Look at that.
They are shooting poisonous
arrows from the palace.
They are killing our archers too.
No.
No, Amatya Rakshas.
Do not worry
because everything is
taking place as per my plan.
They are trying to stop the arrows
that are coming from
the north direction.
They are busy with that.
And they are not worried too.
But death..
Death can come anywhere at anytime.
Now, their death is approaching towards them
in the form of Brother Govi.
Brother will attack on them
with the poisonous arrows
from the southern
direction of the palace
because there are no
Kshatriya soldiers now.
So, when the poisonous
arrows are shot there
the poisonous smoke
will spread as death
in the entire palace.
When Chandragupta will be busy
in trying to stop
the arrows from the north
death will approach him
from the south and kill him.
Before he can understand anything
the poisonous smoke will
mix in everyone's breath
and kill all of them.
If the sand goes into our eyes
it takes away our eyesight
from us for sometime.
And if the sand
particles are not removed
from the eyes at the right time
it can cause an injury in the eyes.
But when the same
sand particles enter a shell
it gives rise to a valuable
stone like a pearl.
The sand is the same.
But the result is different.
Similarly, no human being is cruel.
It is importance for
his teacher to be sensible.
If a task is assigned to somebody
under the right circumstances
with a correct guidance
and according to his capability
any person can give
the best performance.
My ethics..
Your destiny.
The only thing we have left
are the dead bodies of our men.
And they are thousands in numbers.
We don't have any army or weapons
but we do have something
that never fails.
Courage and glory..
'The straw or the storm
who will win this great battle.'

Your Majesty,
this plan of ours is also failing.
Look at that.
They are shooting poisonous
arrows from the palace.
They are killing our archers too.
No.
No, Amatya Rakshas.
Do not worry
because everything is
taking place as per my plan.
They are trying to stop the arrows
that are coming from
the north direction.
They are busy with that.
But death..
Death can come anywhere at anytime.
Brother will attack on them
with the poisonous arrows
from the southern
direction of the palace
because there are no
Kshatriya soldiers now.
Oh, God! They are shooting
arrows even from the South side
and there are no one defending them.
I must fight them myself.
If I do not throw these
arrow off immediately
its smoke will spread
in the whole palace in no time
and all of us will be dead.
What do I do now?
It looks like
for my motherland
and for the motive of my friend
it is time for me to give
this one last sacrifice.
May the enemy be defeated.
Let my country be
united and victorious.
Looks like all their archers are dead.
Indra, bring more curtains.
Indra..
Chandra, look.
There are arrows approaching
from the South end.
Looks like they are
attacking us from there too.
Kill all of them.
I must go to Indra now.
Indra..
We have harmed the enemy enough.
Now let us go.
Indra!
Open the door!
Chandra, I have started this
task and I will compete it myself.
No, Indra.
I will not put your
life at risk like this.
Open the door!
Indra..
Indra.. Indra.
Indra, you knew that they were
attacking from the southern direction.
But you sacrificed your
life to save our lives.
Why, Indra? Why did you do this?
Why didn't you tell me?
Because if I would tell you
you would also do the
same thing that I did.
You would sacrifice
your life for me, Chandra.
You would sacrifice your life.
At the beginning of
this revolution itself
I wanted to protect you at any cost.
Your magic has never failed so far.
Once..
Indra, perform one magic
trick which will succeed.
One last magic..
It is time to show one last magic.
- I will close my eyes.
- No..
A-And I will go to
my brave friends, Chandra.
No, Indra. No.
No, Indra.
You cannot leave us, Indra.
This is my fault.
You have supported
me in every problem so far.
You gave your everything
to this revolution.
This is entire my fault.
First, Dhumketu.
Today, you.
No, Chandra. No.
I am not sad that I am dying, Chandra.
Chandra, I am only sad
that I am leaving you
in between and going.
No, Indra. No.
I cannot lose a great warrior
and a friend like you.
Come back, Indra.
Do not go. Come back.
Let me go, Chandra.
I-I am not scared of death.
Do you know why?
I want to see the flag
of the Maurya Dynasty
that you have hoisted there
flying in every corner of India,
Chandra.
I can see you as
King Chandragupta Maurya
the future king of an
independent India, Chandra.
You are not alone, Chandra.
All of us are with you.
Here.
Here.
So, do not worry about me, Chandra.
Make this motherland
and India a great country, Chandra.
Yes.
Chandra,
you have to free our motherland
from the clutches of cruel Dhananand.
You have to free it.
Who wants me to take
rebirth and come here?
Chandra, if this happens
I do not want to come back to an India
which is being controlled
by a wicked man.
I want to take birth
in a free and independent India.
I want to take birth under
the rule of Chandragupta Maurya.
This is my last wish..
Indra..
Indra..
Dhananand!
You have snatched my brother from me.
I will snatch your brother
from you now.
I should have known
that you are useless.
When Chandragupta and
his friends attacked you
you ran away in fear!
Because of cowards like you,
our plan fails
and that Chandragupta survives.
Go, go inside the palace.
Have your tasty food. Drink!
Because that is all you can do.
Before I do something, go!
Your mere presence disgusts me.
Your Highness, this is the warrior
who was coming towards us
with this white flag.
He says that he can
take us to Chandragupta
as well as help us in defeating him.
But I think we should not trust
this devious, cunning solder.
If I have your permission,
I will kill him right away.
No! No, Your Highness!
Hear me out. I really can help you.
No!
Pardon me, Your Highness
but what if he is telling the truth?
I think we should give him a chance.
Brother, Govi!
Kshatriya warriors cannot be trusted.
Loyalty is in their blood.
You are making a mistake.
Let us assume that he is lying
but you did not want to see me, right?
Then let me go.
I want to trust him.
Okay.
As you wish.
But not one of my soldiers
will pay for your trust.
You have to do all this alone.
Okay.
I made the mistake,
so I will repent for it.
Good.
Take me to Chandragupta.
Your Highness
we have got powerful
and accurate weapons
to break the palace's doors.
Look.
Now that traitor and Chandragupta
will witness Magadh's might.
And this public..
They will also see
how I kill their fake hero.
Acharya!
Acharya, we do not have much time.
Dhananand is advancing towards
the first gate with his elephant army.
Stul, you take care of the work here.
I will go with her. Come.
Get ready, Chandragupta.
As soon as this door is opened
your death will enter in.
You told me that they
have made a tunnel to escape.
But I don't see any tunnel over here.
Where have you got me?
Which place is this?
This is the right place for you.
Stop, Chandragupta.
Don't step forward.
Anyways you wouldn't want anybody
to sacrifice themselves for you
right Chandragupta?
Govishanka, we are warriors
and sacrifice is in our bloodline.
The sacrifice that my brother,
Indra did.
The sacrifice that Shamboo did.
I am going to avenge
every sacrifice through you.
Right now. At this moment.
By killing you.
When you beg for your life,
that is when I will feel
justice for their sacrifices.
The sacrifice you took
from my brother, Indra.
Forgive me. Please, forgive me.
Spare my life. Please, spare my life.
Dhananand's elephantry has arrived.
Have you ever thought
as to why does every
nation have its national flag?
Because a flag is not only
a nation's dignified symbol
but also a representation
of its thought.
The thought which
is formed by its people.
The thought is the one which
decides the progress,
prosperity of its people.
Remember
if a country has to change
then it is important to
change the people's thoughts.
Because a superior nation
can be established
with superior thoughts.
My ethics..
Your destiny.
'When Chandragupta lay down his
weapon watching the blood of his kin.'
'This difficult test
of Acharya Chanakya'
'changed the fate of Chandragupta'
'and the history of India.'

Episode: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6cZ5oXzhfU

Your Highness.
Dhananand has arrived with
his soldiers to win this battle.
His primary target is
to break this first gate.
We have some time left.
We will have to increase
the security of the second door
before he enters the
palace by breaking the door.
This explosive.
We will plant this
in between these two doors.
As soon as Dhananand's
soldiers and that elephant
will step on it, they will
get killed in a huge explosion.
At that time, we will Dhananand
and will divert his path
so that he cannot make
it to the other door.
The plan makes sense, Mister Baldev.
But you will not do this alone.
Even I will help you
in planting these explosives.
Your Highness, we need your help
but not here.
You have to supervise the
security of the second door.
Your presence there is very important.
Sir.
Explosives are ready.
'This door will not be
able to bear the attacks'
'of this elephant for any longer now.'
'I will have to do something.'
Move back! Move back!
No.. No, Mister Baldev!
Mister Baldev!
You cannot do this! Mister Baldev!
No, Mister Baldev!
You cannot do this, Mister Baldev! No!
May the enemy be defeated.
Let my country be
united and victorious.
Dhananand!
Brother!
Brother Govi!
You deserve this, Brother Govi!
I told you that those warriors
cannot be trusted, but you..
You did not listen to me.
'How can brother say this about
Brother Govi at this moment of sorrow?'
'Is whatever Chandragupta
said about brother true?'
'Has brother really killed father?'
Why?
Why did you not listen to me,
Brother Govi?
Why?
Chandragupta did not kill you.
You got killed because of me.
I could not take care of you and look,
what has happened.
They have sent you far
from me forever, Brother.
Where is my sister?
Where is Durdhara?
I am here.
Control yourself, Brother.
Control yourself.
Do you know,
what Brother Govi's wish was?
He wanted you to win this battle.
That is why I will do all
the arrangements of his last rites.
You just focus on the battle.
Go! Kill everyone!
Thank you, Sister.
Those warriors have snatched
our brother from us!
You just see!
I will snatch their lives from them!
They will definitely get
the punishment for this crime.
Bhadrasaal!
Yes, Your Highness.
Have you summoned our special
soldiers for the battle?
They have been summoned
as per your order.
Now, our enemies will not have
any path to escape, Sister.
There will not be any path.
I still cannot believe
that Indra and Mister Baldev
were martyred
and we did not even wait
to express some condolence.
We are continuously
digging this tunnel..
Sir, what is the use
of digging this tunnel?
All our efforts will go in vain
if all of us attain martyrdom
and none of us survive, right?
Stulbhadra
the purpose of digging this tunnel is
that the sacrifice
of the gallant warriors
should not go in vain
who attained martyrdom
in order to protect us
and to get all the
warriors out of here safely
including Chandragupta
who will survive today's battle.
That is the purpose
of digging this tunnel.
We are not digging this
tunnel without any purpose.
Hence, get back to work.
Had you allowed me
to take part in this battle
with Chandragupta and other warriors
our gallant warriors would
not have lost their lives, Acharya.
But no, you will not do this.
Because your stubbornness
matters to you the most, right?
It matters to you the most.
Incredible! Excellent!
Very good.
A mass of rock has appeared here.
That is it. I cannot dig anymore.
I cannot.
Stulbhadra, dig around
the rock if you cannot break it.
But we were digging towards
the direction of the Ganges, right?
Do what I am saying.
As long as we are
moving towards the west
we are following the right path.
Dig around the rock
if you cannot break it.
But you will not stop.
You will keep digging. Continue!
Matsaldev.
Are you understanding Acharya's order?
No.
But I know that we should not
question his intellect and foresight.
That means, we should do what he says.
Forgive me, Chandra.
I know that even you are sad like me.
Even you are alone.
But we would have been
together in this crisis
if we were not helpless.
We would have consoled each other.
Indra..
I have no doubt
that Dhananand's next strike
is going to be lethal
and dangerous.
No matter what his next plan is
and how lethal his
strike is going to be
we are ready to counter him.
Your Highness, as per your order
Konchak army is on its way.
I am sure
they will be able to breach
our enemy's fortress
and security cover.
Bhadrasal, march forward.
If you are able to breach the gate
I will give you
'Hawa Mahal' as a gift.
I know you are always fond of that.
Your Highness,
I will breach the gate for sure.
But not to get 'Hawa Mahal'.
Today, you have showered
so much love and respect on me.
I do not need anything else.
I am waiting for your order,
Your Highness.
'Konchak' army, attention!
This sound!
This is the sound of 'Konchak' army.
'Konchak' army!
Yes, Chandra.
It is a specially trained army.
General Bhadrasaal
himself has trained them.
Each soldier of this army
is equal to ten other soldiers.
And they can use sword and spear
simultaneously using both their hands.
Their security cover is invulnerable.
But they can breach
any security cover.
This is the army which
never lose any battle.
In that case, it is not a big deal
for them to break this gate.
We have only 30 soldiers.
How will we be able to stop them?
March forward!
Sire, look.
Paraspura's flag?
Greetings, Your Highness!
Amatya, I think this is a battlefield.
This is not a place where I can test
the loyalty of these boys
and the son of a traitor father.
Pardon me.
I understand that you are upset
with whatever happened in Paraspura.
But I have come here to
prove my devotion and loyalty.
And for this
I want to help Commander-in-chief
Bhadrasaal and I need your permission.
So that I can join them
and win over the Hawa Mahal.
But you have already proved
your loyalty in Paraspura.
You were the reason
why I could arrest Mura.
'Your Highness, look here's
Chandragupta and his comrades.'
If you still want
to prove me your loyalty
I will not stop you.
Go ahead.
Let me see how loyal you are.
Soldier.
Thank you, Your Highness!
Today, you will see
as to whom I am more loyal
and what all I can do
to prove it.
Now allow me to proceed.
And now, we will not safeguard
this door and ourselves.
We will now safeguard our self-respect
and the valour of Kshatriyas.
And this will be our
only motive henceforth.
Queen Mura.. My people..
Tell me, are you ready
to sacrifice your lives
for your motherland?
Yes, we are ready..
Yes, we are ready..
May the enemy be defeated.
Let my country be
united and victorious.
- May the enemy be defeated.
- May the enemy be defeated.
Let my country be
united and victorious.
Acharya, I am not afraid of my death.
But you are keeping
me away from that martyrdom
which I can attain while
fighting in the battlefield
with my fellow Kshatriyas.
Because of you
I am jealous of how lucky
my fellow Kshatriyas are.
They attained martyrdom
while fighting there
and I am here,
doing this useless work with you.
- Machaldev.
- Yes, Acharya?
Dig a hole of the
same size over there.
Sure.
Machaldev, I do not believe this.
I am sure you are either
not passionate enough to fight
or Acharya has made
you forget your bravery.
That is why you are listening to him
without any question.
You were the
commander-in-chief of Piplivan.
Stul, we can only wait
to find a few answers.
Attack!
A shield.
It saves one
from every attack of the enemy.
That is why every warrior
has respect for his shield.
He keeps it close to him.
A true friend in life is like a shield
who defends every attack
hurled on his friend
and keeps him safe.
A true friend does not even mind
giving his life in saving his friend.
Hence, we should always value
true friends and their friendship.
Because if you have no
shield to defend an attack
how can you kill your enemy?
My ethics..
Your destiny.
'When Chandragupta lay down his
weapon watching the blood of his kin.'

of Acharya Chanakya'

Episode: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9p4Nph6wd0

Attack!
- Attack!
- Attack!
Attack!
Separate the mother and son,
form a circle. Go.
Why is the Paraspura
army coming towards us?
They have Magadh's flag,
which means they are with us.
Let them come.
Attack!
Paraspura's army betrayed us
and supported Chandragupta.
Betrayal!
Marthand has betrayed us
just like his father did.
Be careful, Marthand.
Don't you worry, friend.
You have breathed new life into me.
Though for a few moments
I can take care of it.
There's only one punishment
for a traitor, Emperor.
Death!
Allow me to go and
kill him right away.
No, Amatya.
I, myself will enter
the war field now.
Get my sword!
Marthand!
Your end is coming.
We cannot fight such
a huge army over here.
We should fight them from
inside the Palace. Let's go.
This concoction should
be applied to Govishanka's body.
His last rites will be performed
by the entire royal family
after the end of this war.
Until then we have to stop
his body from decomposing.
'You deserved this, Brother Govi.'
'I had warned you that the
Kshatriyas are not trustworthy.'
'But you didn't pay heed to my words.'
'What do you feel?'
'That your dear father, breathed
his last in your dear brother's arms?'
'No! The hidden truth is that
your brother's arms crushed'
'your father,
Emperor Mahapadmanand to death.'
'He crushed him in
his arms till he died.'
Royal healer!
Brother Govi's death,
reminded me of another death.
I don't know much about that death
but you are with our
family from a long time.
I am sure you will definitely
know about that death too.
Royal Healer
Do you know how my father died?
'Royal Healer, his is your
youngest son, Sudesh, right?'
'He is a cute kid.'
'But if you ever tell anybody'
'the truth of my father's death.'
'If you tell anybody'
'that I crushed him
to death in my arms'
'then remember'
'that you son will also
be crushed to death by me.'
Please tell me.
I am sure that you
definitely know about it.
Your father was chronically ill.
After fighting the disease
for a long time, one day
he breathed his last in your brother,
Dhananand's arms.
'I know that Chandragupta accused
my brother just to mislead me.'
I have waited for this
moment for a long time.
Today, I will make you pay,
Chandragupta.
Bhadrasaal!
Martand!
Martand..
Martand.. Martand..
Martand..
Chandragupta!
Remember what I had told you
at the beginning of this war.
If you go against me you
will not only risk your life
but you will risk the
lives of your loved ones also.
By the end of this war
you will be responsible
for the death of your loved ones.
Do you remember?
I remember every single word of yours,
Dhananand.
But do you remember
what I had told you.
I had told you
that between your army
and my thought of united India
my thought will be victorious.
Stop!
It's my order
that nobody will interfere
between us today.
This war
is exclusively
between me and him.
Get back.
Chandra..
Look, Mura. Look at this.
Look how I will kill your son.
Look how I will put
an end to the last hope
of the Maurya Dynasty.
Witness this scene with your eyes.
Matsaldev, move aside.
- This is my battle.
- I am sorry, Prince.
But I will have to go
against your order today
because I had promised to
protect your life 12 years ago.
Now, you will fight with me.
I think you are forgetting
that the legs on which you
are standing in front of me
was cut by me many years ago.
I had destroyed one eye of yours too.
A handicapped man
is capable of begging
but not to fight a war.
Look, Dhananand.
I am still standing here
in front of you as
a warrior on this battlefield.
You could only harm my body.
But my soul, my trust
and the Kshatriya warrior
within me is alive even today.
You could not destroy that, Dhananand.
I will destroy everything today.
Your soul and your warrior spirit
will be chopped into pieces today.
Come, Chandragupta.
It is time to go from here.
No, Acharya. Leave me.
I will not go anywhere. Let me go.
Chandragupta, try to understand me.
Chandragupta!
You have proved your
point through this war.
You have conquered his palace
in front of the people of Magadh.
But not anymore.
It is time to leave the battlefield.
Chandragupta,
you will need to remain alive
if you want to fight
more such wars in future.
No, Acharya.
Let me go.
Today, either I will kill Dhananand
or Dhananand will kill me.
But I will not run away from here.
Let me go.
I will not spare him.
I will not spare that Chandragupta.
He has murdered my son.
He will suffer.
I will not spare him.
I will not spare Chandragupta.
Lady. Lady, calm down.
Control yourself.
Yes, Lady. Control yourself.
I know that it is not right for
a brave commander like Bhadrasaal
to die at such a young age.
But look at this.
Brother Govi's murder
is also not right.
I have never seen
him in trouble so far.
In fact, I inherited the breathing
problem from mother and not him.
Did mother have this problem?
But..
But I had heard that
father had this problem.
No, father was all right.
In fact, he had no
health issues till he died.
He died all of a sudden. Otherwise..
'The truth is,
your brother's shoulders'
'caused the death of your
father King Mahapadmanand.'
'Dhananand held him by his
shoulders until he lost his life.'
'I will find out the truth behind
father's death from brother now.'
No, Acharya. Let go of me.
I am not going anywhere. Let go of me.
May the enemy be defeated.
Let my country be
united and victorious.
May the enemy be defeated.
Let my country be
united and victorious.
'Matsaldev, I have dug tunnels
under the Hawa Mahal'
'in different directions and ensured'
'that the foundation of the
Hawa Mahal becomes weak.'
'When the right times comes'
'you will pull all the five ropes
together with all your strength.'
'The entire Hawa Mahal will collapse.'
'Okay, Acharya.'
'And I will take advantage
of that situation'
'and take Chandragupta
safely away from here.'
'This is my complete plan.'
'Matsaldev, the command of the war of
an United India is in your hands now.'
'Do not worry, Acharya.
These hands will not shiver.'
'When the right time comes
I will secure the lives'
'of India's future
and Prince Chandragupta.'
'This is the promise of a Kshatriya.'
Stop. Stop, Princess.
There is danger ahead.
Chandragupta..
Your Majesty.
What are you doing, Amatya Rakshas?
The palace is shaking, Your Majesty.
I think Chanakya has made
the foundation of the palace weak.
Leave me.
- Listen to me. Let us go from here.
- Chandra!
Be careful, Your Majesty. Be careful.
Let us go, Your Majesty.
Rakshas, I want to
kill these traitors today.
No, Your Majesty.
You just saw that they fell
under the palace and lost their lives.
No..
Amatya Rakshas, I do not want to
have any misunderstanding this time.
I want to make sure that
none of them remain alive.
Set this palace on fire.
As you say, Your Majesty.
Soldiers, bring the oil.
Take a look at this.
Look at this, people of Magadh.
Look at this carefully.
What is burning here
is not my palace
but it is
Chandragupta's ego.
The palace that gave
shelter to those traitors
is burning today.
And even that flag is burning
because of which
Chandragupta challenged me.
Today, even the flag of Piplivan
is burning along with
the ego of Chandragupta.
Chanakya!
Chandragupta.
Stulbhadra.
Mura.
The people of Magadh
they are those last traitors. No..
All of them are those last traitors
who challenged Magadh
and its self-respect.
They are the ones who
challenged King Dhananand.
They even burned the flag of Magadh.
Now just look.. Please take a look
as to what's happened with them.
All of them who tried to burn Magadh
are reduced to ashes, today.
They did give us a good competition.
But Magadh
like a huge mountain is impeccable.
It's firm.
I agree that they have tried hard
to damage its very foundation
and to make it collapse.
But Magadh is firm and impeccable.
In fact, it is now stronger than ever.
So, never even by mistake
make a mistake.
Because your past, present
and future
is only the King Dhananand.
The impeccable, the eternal
the firm Dhananand
whom nobody can defeat.
You are right, Your Highness!
You are like a firm mountain
and you will always be so.
And we all mean nothing before you.
Forgive this mistake, Your Highness!
Helping this traitor
instead of supporting you
was my son's sheer foolishness.
I am ashamed and
apologetic about this.
Please give me one last
chance to prove my loyalty.
Mark my works, I will take off
Martand's very existence for Paraspura.
Oh..
Get up.
Jagatjala, I have always
considered you a friend of mine.
But yes, at times even the
strongest trees give faulty fruits.
Your son was one such fruit.
He helped the traitors.
He teamed up with our enemies.
It's not your mistake at all.
Come on, hug me
and celebrate this victory. Come on..
Whoever challenges
the ego of Dhananand
meets the same fate.
This is what will happen here.
'Do you think your father'
'lost his life in your
beloved brother's arms? No.'
'The truth is that your beloved
brother's arms strangulated'
'your father,
Emperor Mahapadmanand to death.'
'He strangulated him
until he breathed his last.'
'That means, Chandragupta was right.'
Chandragupta.
Life is a journey
which continuously flows
like a river.
Until it reaches
its destination.
And for me to find my destination
I must keep going.
I must let this fire of revolution
and United Bharat
burn inside me.
This defeat cannot demotivate me.
Because I have many battles to fight.
I still have to see
a lot of our people dying.
I still have to take
revenge for their death.
I want to keep this fire
burning inside me.
And after all these
sacrifices, one day
I also have to rule
the united Bharat
as its emperor.
That's what you have come to told me,
haven't you?
But look
I saved your energy and time, both.
So that you invest
it in finding that man
who can follow your commands.
Who can fulfill your
dream of united Bharat.
No, Chandragupta.
You have understood
the situation wrong.
I have not come here to motivate you.
I have come to relieve
you from this mourning.
Yes.
Look, Chandragupta
you are my dearest pupil
and I cannot let this
depression kill you.
Hence I have come to
make you get rid of this.
You are free.
Go wherever you want to.
And yes, you don't have to worry
about my dream of united Bharat.
I will embark on my
nation-wide journey again
and find a new Chandragupta.
But the Chandragupta I find this time
will not be demotivated by a defeat.
He will not put down his weapons.
No matter how harsh
the circumstances become
he will still fight.
I will find that kind of Chandragupta.
And as far as you are concerned
I will always be thankful to you
for whatever you have done
for my motherland Chandragupta Maurya.
Thank you very much.
Today, this guru of yours
relieves you from all your
duties and responsibilities.
Do you see this shell?
The insect which dwells inside it
bites it from within so much
that it will seem
like it will die inside
but that is actually
the process of its life.
It transforms into
a beautiful butterfly then.
Similarly, after every big defeat
when we start thinking
that it's the end of our life
we should remember
that it is also
a new opportunity for something new.
Because every end results
in a new beginning.
My ethics..
Your destiny.
'Emperor Dhananand,
now I came to know the truth.'
'That you have killed my father and
Chandragupta was saying the truth'
'that you are an evil King.'
'And I will never forgive you.'

Episode: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3x2xH0bK5A

- Chandragupta!
- Chandra..
Your Majesty! Stul!
- Please leave me!
- No, Your Majesty.
If he has even a little
desire to live left in him
then he will fight.
Otherwise, his life is meaningless.
If the Chandragupta I chose
for the creation of united India
and to make him its king
passes this test
then I will consider
that my choice was right.
But if he does not
pass this test today
then I will understand
that the spark of love inside him
for the motherland
is not there anymore
and he is not the Chandragupta,
whom I chose.
And neither
a mother would want such a son
nor a teacher would desire
to have such a student
and nor the land
would want such a boy.
Chandra..
But..
My heart says that
the Chadragupta I chose
was symbol of indomitable
courage and bravery!
And a mother's motherhood
and a teacher's belief
can never be wrong!
My heart says
he is the same Chandragupta,
who will fight this lion today!
He will kill him
and will make sure
that the flag of motherland's
dignity should be in his hands
not in anyone else's hands.
Chandragupta!
Look, you were right.
He's fighting with the lion
and this proves that he wants to live.
Save him now.
No, Stul.
Betraying death isn't enough.
The will to live hasn't returned yet.
Chandragupta is now getting
ready to save his life
and to snatch his every
breathe back from this lion.
Chandra!
What is the further plan?
The plan is still the same
as it was ealier, Chndragupta.
We have to unite the
India which is broken
and have to make you
its one and only king.
And this time, we will start
the first step of our plan
from the capital of Seleucus,
Takshashila.
[sanskrit shlok]
[sanskrit shlok]
[sanskrit shlok]
[sanskrit shlok]
Amatya.
Get the liquor distributed
among all again.
Let the fun of death of Chandragupta
his poor teacher, Chanakya..
and all those warriors
increase even more.
Of course!
Where is Durdhara?
She should have arrived
for the celebration by now.
Amatya, where is my dear sister,
Durdhara?
Is this is how King Dhananand
celebrate someone's death?
Of course!
When it is the death
of an enemy of Magadh.
And now that you are here
I will make this
celebration more special.
It is because you are the
most important person for me.
Let us do what you did
after father's death then.
You are definitely mistaken, Durdhara.
I am talking about celebration
and not mourning.
When father died
for 13 months I wore black clothes
did not wear any ornaments
and mourned his death.
Do you remember that?
Yes, I know..
I know what you did!
I remember what you
did after father's death.
You mourned with me.
You made lots of effort to bring me
out of the pain of father's death.
You were with in my pain
my sorrow and the mourning!
But brother
you mourned for only 13 months
for such a grave sin.
Sin? What sin?
The sin of murdering father.
I know that it was you
who took my father from me.
You killed him!
All for that throne
you killed your own father.
Now you sit on that
throne and feel jubilant.
The throne is covered
with my father's blood.
No, Durdhara.
I admit that I am an Emperor
and not a sage.
But I would not fall so low
as to kill my own father.
And you know I was his favourite son.
So why would I kill him?
You are lying.
You are lying!
You have lied to me before
and you lie to me now!
And you will continue to lie.
But the lie is not going
to benefit you, Brother.
It is because I have
found out the truth.
I know how you killed father.
You killed father
the same way you took
Jagatjala's life, right, Brother?
Durdhara, what are you saying!
- Have you lost..
- Hey!
No one can speak to
my sister in that manner!
No one!
I do not know who trying
to turn you against me.
One thing is for certain
that person is jealous of you.
Yes..
You are so dear to me.
That must be the reason..
The person who told me this truth
has no need to be jealous of me.
His only interest
was to tell me the truth.
The truth that I ignored because
I was besotted by my brother.
But now I wish
I would have trusted him.
He might have been alive now if I did.
Who is it?
You know him very well.
Do you want to hear me say his name?
All right.
He is the same person
whose death you celebrate.
Chandragupta.
Listen..
Chandragupta!
I hope that Seleucus
accepts our proposal
and forges an alliance with us.
Chandragupta.
Parameters of alliances and friendships
often keep changing in politics.
Often a peace proposal
and friendship fails
but a favour always pays back.
It is very crucial in art of politics
about what one does
for someone in time.
Today if Seleucus is alive
it is all because
of our timely warning
that the army of Asaka
will march on him.
'Dhananand's legion
is not coming to your aid.'
'And Asaka's army
marches towards you.'
'Dhananand has devised
this ploy to eliminate you.'
I hope he has not yet
forgotten this aid from us.
I hope what you say comes true.
We are in dire need of assistance
in order to rekindle our rebellion.
No matter the outcome
we will never yield, Mother!
The flame of rebellion will never die!
'Lord Seleucus,
I, Chandragupta Maurya'
'along with Acharya Chanakya
wish to meet you for an alliance.'
'I hope you will accept my request'
'and grant me an audience at once.'
What is your command, Sire?
Last time I met Chandragupta
he was a mere slave!
And today he wishes to meet me
as a prince be it a defeated one!
I wish to see what Chandragupta
and his Teacher
Chanakya have to say to me.
Let them come.
Chandragupta, this alliance of ours
with Seleucus will be very crucial.
We must make certain
that he accepts our alliance
so we can prepare
an army to fight again.
Mother, you must wait here with Stul.
You and Stul will not go anywhere
till Acharya and I are back.
Stul, do not leave her alone.
Rest assured, Chandra.
I will stay with her
and I will never leave her
till you and Acharya get back.
Come, Chandragupta.
Chandra!
Chandra!
Now you do not have
that bracelet of mine.
It was a special ornament.
It united us again
after twelve years.
That memoir of mine reminded you
of who you were!
Of what you were!
Now you are going to face Seleucus
and I want..
That you must always
remember who you are!
Where you come from!
And the blood that
flows in your veins!
You are the light
that will end
the darkness in this land
and be a beacon for everyone.
If there is a famine and there is
only one source of water in the forest
then all the animals
are forced to depend on it.
And in that situation
the prey and the predator
are compelled to live in harmony.
A lion and a deer
drink from the same bank.
If they were to fail in doing so
they will perish.
And hence, in politics
we even have to forge
an alliance with our nemesis
for our survival
and for our existence.
You can fight and win tomorrow
only if you get to live today.
My ethics..
Your destiny.
We are being followed.
We have to avoid them
and reach Queen and Stul as early
as possible through a safe path.
To ensure that both of them are safe.
Hurry up!

================================================================================

Episode: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l19nQCA4jM

You are going to face Seleucus today.
I want you
to always remember who you are
and where your identity
is connected to
and whose blood is
flowing in your veins.
Son, always remember
that you are the Chandra
who has to destroy
the darkness in India
and rise as a new light.
Do not worry, Mother.
Nothing will happen to me.
Princess, you are
sympathising with that traitor
instead of taking
care of your brother.
You are trusting him.
You should trust your brother.
A brother who loves
you the most in this world.
That traitor has
tried to ruin this love.
He laid a seed of doubt in your mind
before dying at the hands of the king
so that he can hurt
the king even after dying.
Princess, he is a traitor.
He is a murderer.
He has murdered your brother,
Govishanka and my son, Bhadrasaal.
He had kidnapped you too.
You are trusting him today
even after knowing what he did.
And you are considering
your own brother
whose life resides in
you a liar and a traitor.
Durdhara.
Princess,
thank God you paid heed to me.
Always remember one thing.
The king does not love
anybody else in this world.
Absolutely.
My sister is the apple of my eyes.
She is my pride,
my respect and my everything.
Durdhara, I am very happy that
you did not believe that traitor.
You trusted your brother's words.
Hug me more tighter, Brother.
More tighter.
As tight as you held
father in your shoulders.
As tight as you held Jagatjala.
Hug me also like that, Brother.
Hug me too.
Whenever..
Whenever anybody
has spoken against you
you have strangled him with
your shoulders and killed him.
Isn't it, Brother?
Kill me also in the same way.
Kill me also in the same way.
Today, I am giving you one chance.
Kill me.
Take away my breath.
Otherwise, I will
make your life miserable
till my last breath.
I will make your life merciless,
Brother.
Listen, Bhadra.
Is there any place here
where my guru can rest?
I am sorry.
I have been ordered only to work here.
I cannot do anything more than that.
- Bhadra..
- Chandragupta!
Patience.
Acharya,
what kind of behaviour is this?
What does this behaviour mean?
We have been standing
here from afternoon
whereas,
Seleucus gave us an appointment.
In fact, he has not
given us a place to a rest.
What kind of behaviour is this,
Acharya?
I told you, Chandragupta.
We have to work patiently and bravely.
Seleucus is well aware
that we need his help now.
That is why he is making us wait.
He is treating us like refugees
because he wants to humiliate us.
If you become restless now
you will prove him right.
Sorry for keeping you wait.
Servant! How can you do this?
Why did you made them
stand here for so long?
Do you not know that
they have just lost
a very big battle against Dhananand?
I am sure they must be very tired.
Arrange for their seating.
King, thank you for giving us a chair.
I accept that we lost
this war against Dhananand.
But we won many others fights too.
We conquered Dhananand's
important Hawa Mahal
and we destroyed it
while we left from here.
The people of whole Magadh witnessed
as to how Chandragupta
faced Magadh's army
and he gave them a tough competition.
The people of Magadh
used to considering Dhananand
as the impeccable one.
But today, they have come to know
that with right ethics
and favourable circumstances
even Dhananand can be defeated.
This is our biggest
victory in this battle.
Yes.
And that is why we
choose to face the enemy
instead of running away
from the battlefield like you.
Either win or get martyred.
That's our war cry. That's our faith.
King Seleucus, even you know
that nobody is as brave and capable
as Chandragupta in the whole Bharat.
He is incredible.
Your partnership with him
will make you more strong.
For how long will
you keep staring at this
model of Magadh's royal palace?
I am sure that you look at it
with an intention
of staying their one day
like a king.
Chandragupta has been
the servant of Dhananand.
He knows all his secrets.
Chandragupta will be a help for you
to fulfill your dream, King Seleucus.
I am sure that you have
brought someone else along.
- Right.
- Very good.
Then what are you waiting for?
Allow me a chance
to show my hospitality.
Thank you, King.
Chandra and Acharya
should have been her by now.
It is too late.
Do not worry, Mother Mura.
They must be almost here.
Acharya, I can see this fire
of revolution burning again
after this friendship with Seleucus.
And all its credit goes to you.
Because you are the one
who saved me from getting
into depression after our son.
What happened, Acharya?
Why do you look tense?
We will take the other way.
But that is a long way.
It will take a lot of time.
Stul and mom are waiting for us there.
Even mom is already very tense.
We are already late, Acharya.
Chandragupta, I don't have
time to tell you everything.
We are being followed. Let's go.
Stul, we must leave
to find Chandra and Acharya.
I can sense that something
is going to be wrong.
But, Mother
Chandra told us clearly
to be here and wait for him.
And he will be tensed
if he doesn't find us here.
I just pray that they are fine.
But, Acharya,
we are now friends with Seleucus.
Then, who will follow us and why?
This is not the time for
an explanation, Chandragupta.
We have to avoid them
and reach Queen and Stul
as early as possible
through a safe path.
To ensure that both of them are safe.
Hurry up!
Chandragupta, you go from this side.
I will go from here and mislead them.
Welcome, Chanakya.
You are most welcome.
Chanakya!
I felt that you would
have forgotten Takshashila
as you were engrossed with Magadh.
I welcome you again
in your fateful place.
Who are you?
What do you expect from us?
Chanakya knows about it.
About me.
By the way, he is known as Ambiraj
but in reality he
is a traitor in disguise.
The traitor who killed
the popular Paurav king, Puru.
The brave Puru
who had forced the world conqueror,
Alexander to quit India.
Technically,
he is from the Royal bloodline
but in reality he is just a trader.
He traded his mother land
for the sake of the throne.
He is the same traitor.
Thank you so much for such
a fantastic introduction, Chanakya.
Thank you, Chanakya.
Provide me an opportunity
for a grand welcome.
Soldiers, arrest them.
Chandragupta, you leave as soon
as you find an opportunity to escape.
I have only one goal.
To unite the entire India.
Your survival is
important for my goal.
Even if I lose my life to save you
even then my life will be meaningful.
- Go away from here.
- No, Chanakya.
I won't leave you
when you are in trouble.
One Chanakya can give
rise to many more like me.
But I can't do anything
alone without you.
I am feeling a strange fear.
I feel as if Chandra
is in some trouble.
What sort of trouble, Ma'am?
I think Selucus will be
thankful for his proposal.
Don't you worry.
Chandra and Chanakya may come
here soon with the good news, Ma'am.
No! We have to go to them
immediately.
Ma'am! Please stop, Ma'am.
Chanakya!
You are making a big mistake,
Ambhiraj.
We have had an alliance with Seleucus.
If he comes to know that
you have done all this then..
Acharya, I am no longer
the innocent prince whom you knew.
Now, I have become a King.
I understand the
intricacies of politics.
I know when to implement
which plan and game.
Shall we go.
Bring them to the palace.
Nobody is around, Ma'am.
I feel we should get
back to the same place.
Come, Ma'am.
Blood?
It means they were here
and surely they have landed
in some serious trouble.
Can you see these lamps.
As long as these
lamps have oil in them
they will keep glowing.
Once the oil is over, they will douse.
Similarly even in our lives
difficult situations
put us to extreme tests.
Many times the
circumstances turn so tough
that it may appear as
if the life is about to end.
At such a time,
we will need each other's help.
After the right support
our lives will be stabilised again.
So, remember
if you help someone in his tough times
that is when someone will
help you in your tough times.
My ethics..
Your destiny.
Chandra and Acharya are no more.
Even if God comes and says
that Chandragupta is no more
I will consider Him a liar!
My son, Chandragupta, is alive!
Until I find him, I will not rest!

================================================================================

Episode: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jK9SnMwcXk4

Lady Mura! Please listen to me.
- We should go back.
- No, Stulbhadra.
I am sure that something
untoward is happening.
Excuse me. Did you see a 15-year-old
boy accompanying a Brahmin?
Yes, I saw them here.
Soldiers of the King of Takshashila
had surrounded them.
They have taken them to the palace.
We have to go to
the palace immediately.
Did I not tell you
that I have learnt the
ways of politics, Acharya?
I have completely learnt them.
After befriending both of you
Ambhiraj made me aware of your truth.
He exposed all your lies!
He told me
that I lost in Assaka because
of you two and not Dhananand.
It was you because
of whom I was defeated
and humiliated!
- I could have died!
- No, Seleucus!
Stop.
I do not know what Ambhiraj
has said to you against us.
You heard his tall tales
but listen to our aspect as well.
This story cannot
have any other aspect.
The truth is that this Brahmin
uses the traitors as his pawns
to defeat the foreigners.
He had done the same
during the reign of Porus.
It was under your guidance
that Porus stopped Alexander
from ruling over India.
This time, you have chosen
Chandragupta as your disciple.
He befriended Dhananand
so that he could stop me from ruling.
Is it not right?
King Seleucus,
try to understand the situations
and the difference due to time.
What I did at that time was
according to the need of the time.
But you are making a mistake
by comparing it to the present.
I agree that I helped
the late King Porus
as he was a patriot.
Whatever he did was
out of his patriotism.
Moreover, he died as
a martyr on the battlefield.
But Dhananand is not Porus.
He is interested in expanding
his power, fame and empire.
This is the motive of his life.
This is his only aim!
He is like the poisonous snake
which if not stopped in time
will kill everyone!
Yes, King. Try to understand.
He will not stay quiet.
That day is not far when he
will try to conquer your Takshashila.
He will rule over it.
Stop him, King Seleucus.
Otherwise, he will destroy everyone!
Enough! You have said enough!
Now, you will not talk anymore!
No.. No, Seleucus. Stop it.
Seleucus, don't do this. Stop it.
You will need us
in defeating Dhananand.
I don't need anyone's help.
No.. Stop it.
Chandra..
No, my Lady. You cannot go there.
They will kill you too.
No one can cheat.
No one can play games with me.
My name is Seleucus Nicator.
Chandra..
Forgive me, my Lady.
I had promised Chandragupta
that I will keep you safe.
I will not let anything happen to you.
I will not let anything happen to you.
Wow, King! Wow!
You have done something
that Dhananand could not do.
'I know that it was you'
'who snatched away my father from me.'
'You killed him!'
Why?
Why is Durdhara upset with me?
How do I make her understand
that I had no other option
than murdering our father?
Is it my fault that
father could not see
that I could be a good
politician and a great ruler?
Please tell me.
Do his other sons have the capability
to rule the Kingdom of Magadh?
Father was adamant
to equally distribute
Magadh amongst all his sons
so that all his sons could be a king.
But is it not foolishness?
That is why to save
the unity of Magadh
I had to kill him.
My sister understands me
better than I do.
Why can she not understand
this simple thing?
What sin.. What sin have I committed?
No, Your Highness.
You have not committed any sin.
Durdhara is young
and she is unable to understand
the depth of the situation.
And at this age,
we tend to think emotionally.
Durdhara is going through the same.
Your Highness, give her some time.
She will forget everything
and forgive you as well.
No.
My sister will not forgive me.
I do not see the
love for me in her eyes.
She hates me.
Since childhood,
I have seen her feelings
towards me clearly in her eyes.
That love, respect, affection
and trust..
Everything seems to be lost.
It seems as if her
heart has been broken.
I have to mend it.
I have to prove it
to her that her brother
is not a betrayer or a sinner.
I have to prove that I have attained
all this due to my capability.
But I do not know how I will do it.
I am angry with myself
because Chandragupta
has delivered such a blow
even after his death,
that it is hurting me every second.
Hey! Stop, Your Highness. Stop.
These people have caused
you so much pain and troubles!
They will have to face the same!
Yes, King. Please stop.
We will torture them so much
until they breathe their last
that when death approaches them,
they will realise
how painful and grotesque
it could be to harm you.
What are you thinking?
I will send them to such a place
where hopelessness, starvation and darkness will be their companions.
They will make them
beg us for killing them.
I will make them go through the
trials of the netherworld while alive.
One such place
is Karth.
You are right.
They deserve such an ending.
Go and throw them into that abyss.
Soldiers! Take them away.
Why is a crowd gathered here?
Has something happened
to Chandra and Acharya..
'I have heard that
challenges excite you.'
'If this is not a facade'
'you will have to bring
that flower for me.'
'There is nothing in this world
that can scare me.
'I will achieve the impossible
and prove it to you.'
'When I fell from that waterfall'
'I went far with the flow
of the water to get that flower.'
'But I did not stop following it.'
'Today, I have brought that flower.'
'Why did you do this?'
'What if something
had happened to you?'
'Since when do you care about me?'
'I am just an object for you,
am I not?'
'No! I have always protected you'
'irrespective of your
behaviour towards me.'
'I have never thought
of troubling you.'
Durdhara, stop!
Where is Durdhara going?
Bring my horse right away!
Durdhara.. What is this?
What are you looking for?
Durdhara, nothing is here.
Everything has been burnt down.
Durdhara, nothing is.. Listen to me.
'Goodbye. I will see you later.'
Durdhara, listen to me.
You can say nothing
to defend yourself.
I know your truth.
I have told this to you earlier.
Perhaps, you have forgotten.
That is why I am telling
this to you again.
You are just a king for me.
You are no longer my brother.
What is this?
You were right to be worried, my Lady.
Seleucus killed
both Chandra
and Acharya Chanakya.
Chandra and Acharya are no more.
Take these, my Lady.
Consider them their cremation urns
and bid them last goodbye.
How dare you!
How can you even think this..
How dare you think that!
How dare you think that!
You can slap me as much as you want.
You can scream as much as you want.
But this is the truth.
It is important that
you accept the truth.
Even if God comes and says
that Chandragupta is no more
I will consider Him a liar!
My son, Chandragupta, is alive!
Until I find him, I will not rest!
My Lady, why do you not understand?
I have seen
their dead bodies.
Did you see their dead
bodies being cremated?
My Lady, believe me..
Did you see their dead bodies burning?
- Answer me!
- No!
I did not see their
dead bodies being cremated.
I did not see their
funeral pyres, my Lady.
I did not.
Then they are alive.
My heart says that they are alive.
Come on, get up..
Take me to the place you
saw them for the last time. Come on!
'I know that it was you'
'who snatched my father away from me.'
'I do not know the one who
is poisoning your mind against me.'
'You know him well.'
'But if you want me to say his name,
here you go.'
'He is the one whose death
is being celebrated by you.'
'Chandragupta.'
'I know your truth.'
'That is why I am telling
this to you again.'
'You are just a king for me.'
'You are no longer my brother.'
Chandragupta!
Can you see this huge tree?
At present, it is standing
tall without any problem.
It does not matter if this poisonous
creeper is creeping all over it.
But if this creeper
is not uprooted soon
then it will destroy this huge tree.
Negative thinking is akin
to this poisonous creeper
which grows gradually
and after establishing its roots
it destroys a person completely.
Therefore, before negative thinking
or a negative person
establish themselves
you should oust them from your life.
Otherwise, they will become
the reasons of your ruination.
My ethics..
Your destiny.
I want that woman in front of my eyes.
She is not an ordinary woman.
She is Chandragupta's mother.
We must go away from here.
The soldiers of Seleucus and
Ambhiraj must be searching for us.
Who are they?
Arrest them.

================================================================================

Episode: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBmtOJ5mGJc

With the death of
this teacher-pupil duo
even their very dream
of United Bharat
will be lost in
the darkness of this pit.
Throw them here. Bring them!
Greetings, Acharya..
What are you looking at?
They are dead.
Throw them on the
heaps of dead bodies.
Come on, do your work.
They are alive. They are alive..
They are alive, master.
Because they are breathing.
We do not have food
for two more people.
Right here.
This is where I saw them
for the last time, Mother.
Chandra..
Don't kill then, chief.
I will give them my share of food.
Where are we?
What place is this?
You can call it
the life after death.
The purgatory.
That it what this place resembles.
We are deep inside the earth
away from everything.
We are just alive here.
Our lives have no meaning.
We are dead for this world
and for our loved ones.
We have no existence.
We have been dumped here
so that everyone forgets me
and so that nobody even
finds out where we are.
We are just alive
but our existence is dead.
No.
I cannot forget who I am.
I cannot forget my existence.
'Always remember this, dear.'
'You are that Chandra'
'who has to make Bharat
get rid of this darkness'
'to bring a new dawn of change.'
My mother cannot forget either
that I have promised her to come back.
She can never forget this promise.
I can..
I can feel his existence, Stul.
He is somewhere around.
And he is even trying to come to me.
Mother, Chandra and Acharya
are not to be seen here.
We must go.
The soldiers of Seleucus and
Ambhiraj must be searching for us.
We cannot stay here for long.
As per the command of
King Seleucus and Ambhiraj
we must be cautious.
Chandragupta and Chanakya's comrades
will surely come here to find them.
If you get a doubt on anyone,
arrest them immediately.
Understood? Go.
No, I won't go!
I know that Chandragupta
is somewhere around.
I won't go.
Who are they?
Arrest them.
- Mother, let's go.
- No!
Mother, let's go.
Get up..
Get up.
Had just the desire
to live been enough
perhaps, nobody would've
ever died in this world.
The will power
that you are mocking
will also show
the way to come out of this pain.
We just need to
try continuously.
They would be that side.
Come with me.
Lady Mura, nothing is left for us here
after Chandra
and Acharya have left us.
I know a secret place
from where we can escape secretly.
If you are so sure
that Chandragupta is no more
I will also prove you wrong.
Come with me.
What do you mean by they ran away?
It may take you days or years
but I want that woman
in front of my eyes.
She is not an ordinary woman.
She is Chandragupta's mother.
The Chandragupta who has shaken
the foundation of Magadh alone.
We will have to find him at any cost.
I do not want the fire of revolt
that he had lit in Magadh
to burn here in Takshashila.
Otherwise, just like Dhananand
my life will also be ruined.
Your Majesty,
your rule is getting established
in Magadh once again.
The people who had refused
to pay taxes due to Chandragupta
are bowing down to you
and will continue to do so.
Just like Chandragupta
his name will also
be erased very soon.
This is what I want, Amatya.
Chandragupta's memories
should be erased
from Magadh very soon.
How made the mistake
of disturbing the council
of Magadh's king, Dhananand?
It is me, Amatya.
Princess?
What is all this, Durdhara?
I am sorry, Your Majesty.
I forgot to tell you one thing.
I am getting
the Hawa Mahal reconstructed.
These materials are
for the same purpose.
I just want to ensure
that when the Hawa Mahal
is reconstructed
it should be bigger
and beautiful than before.
This is a good idea.
I am happy
that you are interested in
the reconstruction of the Hawa Mahal.
I am also happy, Your Majesty.
You know what?
I am looking into the tiniest details
in the reconstruction
of the Hawa Mahal.
Your Majesty,
you constructed the Hawa Mahal
only for me.
So, I want to gift you
the first brick for the reconstruction
of the Hawa Mahal.
Just like this brick
every brick in the palace
will have a special mark.
What happened?
I think the king
did not like this gift.
I am sure that you and everyone
will remember this forever
after the reconstruction
of the Hawa Mahal.
A lot of work in the reconstruction
of Hawa Mahal is still pending.
I will take your leave now.
My sister is ruining my plans
of forgetting Chandragupta's memories.
By the reconstruction
of the Hawa Mahal
not just the Hawa Mahal
but Chandragupta's thinking
will also remain alive.
Thank you.
Have you ever seen the world outside?
No. I just know about
this small part of the sky.
I can see it from here.
No problem.
Acharya will tell you.
Hearing it will make
you feel like you are
experiencing that beauty in person.
Really? Then tell me quickly.
How is the world outside?
The outside world
is very beautiful and picturesque.
There are many wonderful
creations of nature.
Huge mountains, unyielding,
containing many rivers in themselves.
And endless oceans.
And in oceans, quick flowing,
leaping waves.
Farms and fields,
flowers of many colours
and smells.
And on those flowers
hover butterflies.
Birds chirping in the skies.
And in jungles many kinds of animals.
You can think of the world
as a stage hosting many
plays of life and death.
It is an unique stage built by God.
Wow! The outside
world is that wonderful!
Yes.
I want to experience
all that you have told me.
I also want to see the outside world.
You will definitely see it.
Why are you giving him
false hopes, Priest.
You should teach him
about the universal truth
that is constant.
Death.
Accepting that very truth
has given peace
to the people here.
And you are destroying their peace
with these false stories
and false hopes.
No!
What you call peace is in reality
a poisonous seed of pessimism.
Which will take away your hopes
and destroy your present and future.
The truth is
that you, I and all of us
have the same future.
And I have complete
faith in those hopes
and this small square of sky
which will keep
our hopes alive.
It will keep us alive.
We all know that ants stay in groups.
But have you ever thought why that is?
Because they recognise
the power of unity.
That is why they work
as an organisation.
Be it to collect food
or to build a place to live.
They do all the work together.
That is why, despite being
such small creatures
they survive the most
hardest of conditions.
The same way,
if humans can recognise
the power of unity and cooperate
then be it a question
of filling your belly
or a question of life and death
victory is certain.
All we need is to recognise
the power of unity.
My ethics..
Your destiny.
My son is alive.
Because Chandra has not fulfilled
the goal of his life yet.
He has to make India undivided.
Chandragupta will return
to fulfill his destiny.

================================================================================

Episode: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ILV5WT3Cjo

You believe that Chandragupta is dead.
Right?
Can you see these hungry crows?
Our scriptures say
that crows have the spirit
of dead inside them.
Hence, crows are fed the offertories
meant for the dead ancestors to eat.
I will keep this food
for Chandragupta today.
If he is dead
one these crows
will definitely eat this food.
See!
Did you see that?
The crows did not eat the food.
That means, my son is alive.
I promise, I will come here every day.
I will put food here
for Chandragupta every day.
When a crow eats the food
that day I will believe you
that Chandragupta is dead.
Lady
I do not want
to blight your hope.
This is not just about my hope.
I am saying this
because Chandra has not fulfilled
the goal of his life yet.
He cannot die without fulfilling
the goal of his life.
Chandra's life is
like this Banyan tree.
Do you know why it's
called 'Vat Vriksha'?
It symbolises never-ending life.
The roots that rise from the ground
take the form of a tree
as time passes by.
Chandra's life and fate
is like this Banyan tree.
He also has to bloom
and help India attain freedom.
He has to make India undivided.
He has to protect everyone.
Chandragupta will return
to fulfill his destiny
for his mother, teacher and nation.
He will definitely return.
When he returns, he will
change things for the entire India.
What is it, Chandragupta?
It looks like the seed of Banyan tree.
Things are changing.
What can we do with
that seed in these barren lands?
Chandragupta.
'No story is more
divine that the ones'
'based on the source of life.'
'We all know'
'many life forms begin with a seed.'
'The journey of a seed
becoming a huge tree'
'has hope, grief'
tries, success and failure.'
'But even in the most
difficult situations'
'life finds its way'
'because life's power is'
'stronger than destruction.'
'In the struggle
between life and death'
'life has always won
because of the will to live.'
'The same thing will happen
inside this trench too.'
'Because of this small Banyan seed'
'the flowers of our hopes'
'and aspirations shall bloom.'
'I forgot to tell you something.'
'I am rebuilding the Hawa Mahal.'
'I want to gift you the
first brick that will be used '
'to rebuild the Hawa Mahal.'
I apologise, Your Majesty,
but you should rest.
You have been exercising
since a long time.
Sire, my soul
my heart.. And every breath of mine
is in pain because I lost my sister.
There is no point
in giving my body
rest in such a situation.
Whenever my sister calls me
'Emperor' instead of 'Brother'
I feel like Chandragupta
is laughing at me from hell
and mocking me.
He made my victory pointless.
I feel like I lost even though, I won.
Everyday, I wonder
how I can fix
mine and Durdhara's relationship.
How can I make my
sister love me again?
'Brother..'
'Princess Durdhara is arriving!'
Amatya Rakshas
I want you to choose
the best artisans from Magadh!
And make exactly the same flag.
This one is burnt.
But remember
the new flag should
look exactly the same.
Nothing should go wrong, all right?
Durdhara.
What happened, Emperor?
Oh!
I think you didn't like the flag.
But I like this
Piplivan's flag the most.
You know why?
Because Chandragupta has acquired this
by his bravery,
his hard work and his deeds.
It's different from the Magadh's flag
that's hoisted in your mansion.
The flag
that's decorated by my father's blood!
I can neither see your
hard work nor your abilities in it.
Neither this flag honours you
nor do the citizens
of Magadh respect you.
Wait!
If that's what you feel
come with me.
Here.
Can you see this map, Sister?
There are 15 kingdoms
situated around Magadh.
Today, I
your brother
the emperor of Magadh promise you
just by my abilities
and capabilities
without any help or any alliance
I will win over
all these neighbouring kingdoms.
I will prove
that I am capable
of whatever I am today!
Being the greatest
emperor of this country
is not my stubbornness
but my destiny.
Be it after father's death
or even in his presence
my destiny would surely bring me
to the Magadh's throne.
For your sake
just for your sake when
I will win all these kingdoms
your hatred
will get converted into pride.
Perhaps you will address me
as brother once again
instead of emperor.
It has come out..
The seedling of all of
our bright future has raised.
'We will meet very soon, Mother.'
Chandra!
What happened, lady?
I felt
as if Chandra called for me.
Someone help me.
Who's that?
Give me the goat quickly or else,
I will not spare you!
Have some mercy on a poor man like me.
This goat is the only
source of my income.
You seem to be belonging
to a cultured family.
Just imagine, if your parents
learn about your behaviour
- they will be quite depressed.
- Can you see this dagger?
My father has given it to me.
He's the one who taught me
there's no one your own in this world.
We should be only concerned
about our survival.
Come on, you better
give me this goat now.
Otherwise..
Let him go.
Are you going to stop me?
Do you see this dagger
or not you stupid woman?
I said, let him go.
I should let him go, is it?
Think before using your might
on some helpless person next time.
Do you get it?
Come on, get up. Leave.
Lady, I am grateful to you.
What are you thinking, Lady Mura?
That what would have Chandragupta done
if he had seen this.
What do you mean?
Whatever we saw was only
a part of the harsh reality, Stul.
There are many boys like that one here
who are aimless
and on whom the future
of our country depends.
When Chandragupta will return tomorrow
to lead this country
then what kind of subjects
is he going to lead?
These kind of aimless
and greedy subjects, is it?
Who neither have hope nor humanity.
No, Stul,
we will have to do something.
We will have to give a direction to
the lives of the youth of this country.
And along with that
we will also have to keep
the flame of revolution burning.
We will have to find such youths
who will fight to
make our country free.
So that when Chandragupta returns
he has his own army.
Lady Mura, do you have any idea
how risky the thing
which you are saying is?
We are in our enemy's land.
The soldiers of Seleucus and Ambiraj
are searching for us
like a hunger lion.
To do all this in such a condition..
How are we going to accomplish this,
Lady Mura?
Give us alms.
Give us alms.
Give us alms.
Give us alms.
Stulbhadra,
perhaps, I have found a way
to keep the flame of revolution burning
without falling into their sight.
Give us alms.
Give us alms.
Sage, I wish to do something
for the future of this kingdom.
But, I need your help for that.
Will you help me?
Definitely. Why not?
'Untill now, all these
people were under the influence'
'of a false belief
and negative mentality'
'that they will never
become free from this trench.'
'That is why, these people
were stranded in this trench.'
'But now, for the first time'
'they all have united together.'
'Hence this thing which has
never happened all these years'
'is going to happen
in this trench now.'
'The journey of this
seed will make them hopeful'
'from being hopeless.'
'It will give them a reason
to get together and put up a fight'
'not only for their own survival'
'but also for a golden future.'
That time will come
soon when I will return
to fulfill the promise
I have made to my mother
my guru's vow
and my duties towards my motherland.
To build a prosperous India
which would be a free country.
Thousands of years ago
some man would have
tried to start fire
by rubbing two ordinary
stones like this.
Before he succeeded in his attempts
he might have faced many failures.
People with negative mentality
might have even discouraged him
and also might have tried to stop him.
Not only that
people might have even made
fun of him innumerable times.
But, he did not give up.
And finally, he discovered fire.
Similarly, there comes
such situations in our lives
when we will have to ignore everything
and sincerely keep trying continuously
with full faith.
Only then we can make impossible,
possible.
Only then we can bring
about amazing and exceptional
changes for
the welfare of mankind.
My ethics..
Your destiny.
The dreams of forming Undivided Bharat
remained unfulfilled, many years ago
Chandragupta will return
after many years to fulfill it.

================================================================================

'Whether the life ends
or the story'
'time does not stop.'
'On one side, Chandragupta'
'was trying to get out'
'of that dark pit of despair'
'where he and Chanakya were thrown,'
'and on the other side'
'Dhananand was longing'
'to get out of the dark pit'
'of his sister's hatred.'
'To fight with the hatred of Durdhara'
'Dhananand decided
to fight in battlefield.'
'So that he can prove to Durdhara'
'that he is not only
the murdered of his father'
'but he is capable
to be the king of Magadh.'
'Just to get back love
and dignity back of her sister'
'Dhananand started destroying villages,
cities and kingdoms one by one.'
'Days started changing into weeks.
Weeks into months and months into years.'
'One by one, Dhananand'
'conquered 15 districts.'
'Now, five years later,
his aim was to conquer'
'the 16th and last district,
Takshashila'
'which would make him
the most powerful and best'
'emperor of Indian history.'
'In these years,
everything changed.'
'If something did not change.'
'it was a mother's faith.'
In Dhanurasana,
the most important thing is
controlling your breath.
Just like a deft archer.
Like this.
- Yes.
- Have mercy!
Exempt us from tax this time.
If you do not pay the tax,
we will skin you alive.
Now we will do Pranayama.
In Pranayama,
with the flow of your breath
you have to close your eyes
and count till 200.
Remember, do not let
the flow of your breath break
or open your eyes until you
have counted till 200.
Start.
- One.
- One..
- Two.
- Two..
Three..
King Seleucus and Takshashila's king,
Ambhiraj
have given strict orders
to pay 70 per cent tax
on your produce.
Otherwise, you will all die.
Someone calm these horses down.
Someone stop them.
Forget the horses.
Protect the cart.
The tax money is in the cart.
Count the bags of money again.
One bag of money is missing.
180.. 181..
198.. 199..
200!
Satyarth, you fell asleep
during Pranayama!
Forgive me.
That way.
He came here.
Look for him.
Why are you here?
Temples and schools
are equally respectable.
You should not
disrespect this place.
Forgive us, Lady.
We saw a thief coming this way.
These students will be
the future of India.
There are no thieves here.
But..
I think we are wasting our time.
Why would the thief come
to such an open place?
Let us go.
Now we will do Ashwasana.
This sound is the signal
of an attack.
The reason behind
this discourtesy
of bringing a horse
to the court, Ambhiraj?
King Seleucus,
this is not a mere horse.
It is a message.
'Surrender or destruction.'
Who sent this message?
The one who has
conquered 15 districts.
Now he has departed
with his entire army
to conquer this 16th
and last district, Takshashila.
King of Magadh, Dhananand!
Hail King Dhananand!
Hail the King of Magadh!
Hail King Dhananand!
Hail the King of Magadh!
Hail King Dhananand!
Hail the King of Magadh!
Hail King Dhananand!
Hail the King of Magadh!
Hail King Dhananand!
Whether Seleucus fights or surrenders
one thing is certain
that Takshashila will now be ours!
Amatya, after we have
conquered Takshashila
break this mountain
and plant a beautiful garden here.
And I will present it personally
to my sister, Durdhara.
I will tell her
that I fulfilled my promise
and proved
that I am not only capable
enough to rule Magadh
but I can also conquer
all the 16 kingdoms.
As you command, sire.
I am sure
that we are completely
safe under your shelter.
The whole army of Takshashila
is waiting for your command.
But I still think that
we should not fight him
but enter into a settlement.
His confidence
and his army's strength
has increased by many times
in the last five years.
He didn't lose even one battle.
Bowing down to the enemy is your way
and destroying him is mine.
- Your Highness..
- Ambhiraj, do not forget
that if Dhananand has
strengthened his army
even I have gained victory
across all the direction.
And a troop of mine has
already embarked
to meet me here.
So you had an inkling
that Dhananand might attack us.
Yes.
I knew that he will not be at peace
for as long as he does not invade
all the other 16 kingdoms
of this country.
And now, I am ready for his attack.
You are right..
Compromise is a sign of losers.
Battle is what suits
brave hearts like us!
King Seleucus, a brave heart
like you has taken birth
to conquer the world.
We will surely
answer back Dhananand.
My army and I am at your service.
Not just your army.
I need every person of this country.
Be it a small kid or a young man
be it an old person
or the handicapped..
I want all of them
to serve this purpose
who can at least lift weapons.
And I have made
arrangements for the same.
Give me the spear.
Take it, go!
Come here, take it!
Here, take it! Be careful!
Make sure you handle it properly.
Go.
What are you waiting for?
Pick up this weapon
and get on to the battlefield.
It is now time for
the people of Taxila
to enjoy the sight of Dhananand
bowing down to us.
Nobody is going to show
any sympathy on you.
Pick up this weapon
and be a part of this noble cause.
Come on!
Go..
Go..
Hey, you old man!
Don't you hear!
Get on to work!
Listen, mister, it is your age to pray
and not to take up sword.
Go home straight and hide yourself.
And do not come out
until we get rid of this state of war.
Thank you, dear..
Thank you..
Come on..
Keep moving.
Mother..
We are going to face
our enemy again.
After conquering 15 kingdoms
Dhananand is now approaching
toward Takshashila.
Mother, you know how
powerful he has become
in the last five years.
Whenever you sense a storm of change
it is the sign of Chandra's arrival.
If Dhananand is coming here
even Chandra will.
Stulbhadra, the destiny
has performed its miracle.
I have seen so many
changes in all these years
but your belief is still unchanged.
Even I want your trust to win.
I want Chandra to come back.
I wish what I saw five years go
turns out to be wrong.
That is what will happen.
Whatever you saw
will prove out to be wrong.
I waited for Chandra for 12 years
in Dhananand's palace.
And my son did come.
He will come back even today.
For the sake of me
he will cross every hardship
and be here.
The right time is here.
Go ahead, Chandragupta.
Calm down, Chandragupta!
The attack which you make
by staying calm
is what turns out to be
the most dangerous one.
Control your breathing.
Your will surely
fulfill this task today.
Do not hurry, Chandragupta.
Do not be hard like a stone.
Become resilient like the water
which makes noise
in the flow of the river
but it becomes quiet
when it joins the sea.
Become a part of the tree
on whose branch you are standing.
If you become a part of this tree
it will not be able to put you down.
Focus, Chandragupta.
Move towards your goal.
Stop.
Chandragupta.
Are you ready?
Leave!
Chandragupta.
We cannot send you higher than this.
You will have to make way above this.
And you may not be able to go
higher than this henceforth.
Do not come down now.
Keep going above, Chandragupta.
You have to go out of this dungeon.
Take strength and
inspiration from your birth
your goal and your motive.
Think about your mother,
Chandragupta.
She has suffered a lot.
But she kept you alive
under all circumstances.
Think about your
revenge from Dhananand
Ambhiraj and Seleucus.
Chandragupta, think about
the innocent people
who have been tortured
by these wicked rulers
from many years.
Chandragupta, last try.
"Chandragupta Maurya."
"Chandragupta Maurya."
"Chandragupta Maurya."
Come out, friends.
Hey, what are you doing?
Are you throwing water
on me to distract me
just because you are
on the verge of losing?
When did I throw water on you?
Somebody is throwing water on me too.
Hey, who are you
and what are you doing here?
Friend, can you not see?
I am having a bath.
I had seen such cold
and clean water
only in my dreams so far.
Wow!
Let me enjoy this reality.
You guys continue
playing the game.
Go.
But where did you come from?
Can you see that dungeon there?
From there.
Are you drunk?
We have been guiding
this place from years.
Nobody could come out
of this dungeon so far.
Tell me the truth. Who are you?
I am telling you the truth.
You know,
there is magic in that dungeon.
Magic.
Do you not believe me?
Look at this now.
Just like me, more people
will come out from that dungeon.
One.
Two.
Three.
Did you see the magic?
How about you?
You saw. Right?
Now, please let me
enjoy the fresh water.
You can leave.
Shocking.
They do not understand
that I told them for their own good.
Go away.
Later do not complain
that I did not warn you.
"We have the courage to melt the sky."
"We will make an Integral
and free country."
"He is a warrior Of Arya Dynasty.
He is a brave warrior."
Make sure no one else escapes.
Cut the rope!
We went in together, Acharya
and we will leave it together.
Listen up, folks.
The army will be passing though here
so move aside.
What are you doing?
The state is rife with incidents.
Everyone is on alert.
Had a soldier seen you
distributing stolen
money among the beggars
it would have been catastrophic.
They feed themselves
using these coins.
In that case
I'll give them my food.
But you need to leave.
And hide the coins in a secure place.
When the right time comes
we will distribute
this wealth among the poor.
'Takshashila's' situation is serious.
But
you should not refrain from enjoying
the freedom you have got
after so much hardship.
Please go.
Go and fulfill your incomplete wishes.
After that
we will again regroup here.
In these five years
I am well aware of this
unfulfilled desire of yours.
But
do you still have faith
that even after five years
queen Mura will be waiting
for you in 'Takshashila'?
Acharya.
A mother's hope never fades.
And I had promised mother
that I will come back.
And mother knows very well
that her son, Chandragupta,
will lay down his life
but
he will never free himself
from the promise he had made.
That is right, Chandragupta.
If you really have faith
then you may go
and search for queen Mura.
In the meantime
I will take stock of
events in 'Takshashila'.
All right, Acharya.
Mother..
Mother.
Please forgive me.
I thought that you..
Listen.
There used to be
a banyan tree over here.
- Did you see that tree?
- Hey, listen.
Hey..
Hey, why are you running away?
The selection process
for the army is going on.
And you were trying to escape!
Nobody can escape my glance. Got it?
I see.
I was forced to stop
by your glance.
And I thought that
I had stopped on my own
assuming that you won't be able
to chase behind me and stop me
with your such a big belly.
You will definitely get punished
for your misbehaviour.
To heck..
That was the reason
I suggested you
to reduce your belly.
This is my horse.
Just assume that I have
borrowed it from you.
I need to search for someone.
And I am running out of time.
See you later.
Stop. I said, stop.
I said, wait..
Y-You are here!
Hail Prince Ambikumar!
Hail Prince Ambikumar..
Durjan Singh, I want to know
whether all the vacancies
are filled or not.
And I want an update regarding
the selection process for the army.
Yes, Prince.
I am just finishing the process.
Hurry up, Durjan Singh.
The war can begin anytime.
Okay, Prince.
That youth..
There was something special about him.
Physique, intelligence, words..
He was blessed with
these three qualities.
But who is he?
Everything has changed here.
How will I find you, Mother?
But I am sure
that you are somewhere around here.
Because you cannot go
far away from your Chandra.
The information is authentic.
It is Dhananand's army
which is marching towards Takshashila.
Is Chandragupta aware of this?
No.
I need to inform him immediately.
This is the banyan tree
I was looking for.
Mother..
Mother, I have returned
to fulfill my promise.
Chandra.
This is the horse
which is used by Takshashila army.
That means, a soldier
has reached here searching for me.
Where are you, Mother?
How will I find you now?
Chandragupta!
Chanakya!
To establish his supremacy
over all the 16 states
Dhananand is proceeding towards
Takshashila to wage a war.
I have been waiting for this moment
from the past five years, Chanakya.
Today, Dhananand's arrival over here
is determined by destiny.
It's the time now
to ignite the flame of
our patriotism once again.
The flame which will crush the enemies
of our motherland.
Even Dhananand.
He is the one
who killed my friend, Indra
Dhumketu
and many innocent people
along with Piplivan's
courageous soldiers.
Ambhiraj!
The selfish one
who traded our motherland
with the foreigner, Seleucus.
Seleucus,
because of whom I was estranged
from my mother
for a period of five years.
Now, I will
avenge them.
To erase these kingdoms
from the motherland
and make their lives miserable
I am back.
"He is a thread of unity."
"He is a dawn of new India."
"This new India has
confidence and bravery."
He is Chandragupta Maurya.."
Whenever a sculptor
creates a new sculpture, he does
not carve out a statue from a stone
but he removes the unwanted excess
and creates a new statue.
In the same way, if a person adopts
the same principle in his life.
Based on time
and situation if he sacrifices
out-dated thinking, fear
and the feeling of insecurity
he frees himself
then he will be able
to transform himself
into a new and improved personality.
Then he will be the sculptor of
his own destiny
and carve a nice for himself.
My ethics..
Your destiny.
This is the moment for
which I was waiting for so long.

================================================================================

Episode: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y13umtUHjEQ

With the intention
to establish his rule over all
the sixteen kingdoms,
Dhananand is proceeding towards
Takshashila to wage a war.
From the past five years
I was waiting
for this moment, Acharya.
Today,
Dhananand's arrival
here is determined by fate.
Now,
it is the time for our
revolution
to rise to the peak.
We have to
crush the enemies
of our motherland.
Calm down, Chandragupta.
Peacefully,
try to understand the reality.
The three enemies that you
wish to destroy
if their collective
armies are united
it is enough to
conquer the entire world.
Now, what is your stand against
these three powerful enemies?
An ordinary youth,
who was in a dark pit.
Who does not have
anything else now
apart from his
uncontrolled anger.
It is bitter, Chandragupta.
But this is the fact.
You don't have an
identity today.
You don't have anything
to define you.
Neither are you the prince
of Piplivan
nor the commander of the
Kshatriya army.
The truth is that
you don't have anything now
with which you can defeat
these three powerful enemies.
So what shall I do, Acharya?
Should I accept defeat and
be a mute spectator?
Should I continue to watch
my motherland being tortured?
No, Acharya!
Never.
I will definitely face them.
No matter
what the outcome is.
You are right.
We will
definitely face them
but with an ideal strategy.
What is the strategy,
Acharya?
In this battlefield, soon
there will be three emperors
and three armies.
Our task will be to
instigate them against each other.
We have to ensure that they
fight amongst themselves
and turn the battlefield
into a graveyard of each other.
I got it, Acharya.
According to your strategy,
I have to participate in this war
and turn the situation into
something severe and powerful
that these three should fight among
themselves
and kill each other.
So that, by the end of this battle,
our motherland should
be free of these enemies.
But, to bring such
a drastic change in this battle
and the battle strategy,
it is important that you get into
Ambiraj's or Selucus'
army as an ordinary soldier.
I have an idea for that,
Acharya.
How dare you?
First you took my horse
and now you are standing
here shamelessly!
Hey Lord. Forgive me, Lord.
You have misunderstood me.
Lord,
your horse is at fault.
Your horse took
me away from here.
I tried a lot to
convince it
to return to you,
but it did not agree.
Then it just took me all
over the kingdom again and again.
I cannot express how hard it
was for me to
convince and tame it to
return to you.
Okay.
Soldier!
Take this horse.
You can go.
Right now I am very busy.
Hey, sir!
You are asking me to leave.
Please do not do so.
I am also a patriot.
I will also fight
for Takshashila
against Dhananand's army.
Is it? Do you want to
participate in the army?
Okay, I will appoint you
right away.
Thank you, Lord.
Thank you.
You are great, Lord.
You are great.
So,
tell me where shall I collect
my weapons and armour?
Please tell me, Lord.
Those are not needed.
You do not need that to
serve water to the soldiers.
Lord, in such a crucial
battle, you are just assigning
me an ordinary job
of serving water to the soldiers.
Yes! Patriotism
is not proved by wearing the armour
or using the sword.
When our courageous and
powerful soldiers fight
in the battlefield,
to serve them water
is also a
part of patriotism. Yes!
But,
please listen to me, Lord.
It is okay..
Can you see that pot?
Go there and start your service.
Go ahead.
Hurry up.
Durjan Singh!
Look at the saddle of my horse.
Repair it right now.
O-Okay, prince.
I will get you a new one right away.
Hey, please
serve some water to the prince.
Prince, I will return soon.
Prince!
Prince, if you permit,
can I fix the saddle to your horse?
Okay, go ahead. Hurry up.
I do not have much time, understood?
As you wish.
Prince!
Durjan Singh!
Give weapons and armour
to this soldier.
But, Prince he is just an
ordinary water serving person.
How can we..
He fixed the saddle of
my horse in a jiffy.
He is a trained soldier.
He's made for
battlefield, not to serve water.
Mister.
Water?
Where can I get
my armours and shield?
Go. Collect it from there.
Throw them in that trench.
'By paying the debt
of the motherland'
'Chandragupta Maurya
is coming to host the flag'
'of Maurya dynasty again.'
Great, Chandragupta.
You have entered the battle.
Now, you have to
take the plan to the next step.
When two great armies
face each other in any battle
their leaders
execute the strategy
of battle by staying in the middle.
They do not get involved
in the battle themselves.
You have to
break this flow of battle.
You have to create
such a situation
where the leaders
of both these armies
become bound to fight
on the battlefield
quit their safe zone
and go ahead towards
their death themselves.
You have to make
an impression of a skilled warrior
in front of them.
I will make the desire
that you all have
to become best, the reason
of your destruction.
Take your positions!
- Attack!
Ambhi Raj, look
at that soldier. Such a brave boy.
He is defeating the army
of Magadh alone.
Undoubtedly,
Your Highness Seleucus..
You recognised the best
one among this crowd in the battle.
Father, I discovered that soldier.
I have appointed him
in the army myself.
Is.. Is this soldier
discovered by you?
Wow!
His Highness Seleucus'
focus is centred on that soldier.
If even you want to become
great in his vision
then try to win
this battle because of that soldier
and you get the credit of this victory.
Okay?
- Yes, Father.
Ambhi Kumar has come
to the battlefield.
And Chandragupta will soon
bound Dhananand as well
to come to the battlefield.
King we are trying to put a
stop on the enemy.
Look there, a soldier of the enemy is
killing your soldier continuously.
I can easily recognise
the difference
between an ordinary
soldier and a warrior, Amatya.
He is not
an ordinary soldier.
Very good, soldier.
Your performance is praiseworthy.
Now I order you to stay close to me.
Thank you, prince.
It is a matter of honor for a common
soldier to be praised by you.
Brother!
The king of Takshashila,
Ambhi Raj's son
Ambi Kumar has come
to the battlefield.
If we will kill him
then the morale
of his army will be weakened.
You are right.
Their morale will be weakened
and we will become great
in His Highness' vision.
Come on.
- Come on!
'The most sure shot solution
to defeat the enemy in battle'
'is to
attack his weakness.'
'And the battle'
'in which both father
and son are participating'
'if it is about the life
of the son'
'then no one is weaker
than that father.'
'That means, if I need
to bring Ambhi Raj to the battle'
'then I will have to
increase the danger on Ambhi Kumar.'
'Yes.'
Ambikumar!
Let us proceed.
Prince you go I will stop them.
Soldier take the prince to his shelter.
Soldier, I will never forget
what you have done for me today.
But King Ambiraj, you should
take revenge
of every single attack
done on your son.
Hey, I will kill you.
'Acharya's prediction regarding
Dhananand was absolutely right.'
'He is as selfish as
he used to be.'
'If the lives of Dhananand's
brothers and his generals'
'are in danger
during the battle'
'it will not make
any difference to Dhananand.'
'He is only concerned'
'for his victory.'
'His ego matters to him the most.'
'If you want to force
Dhananand to fight in the battle'
'then you
have to hurt his ego.'
'There is only one way
to hurt Dhananand's ego'
'an insult
to Magadha's pride.'
'And the symbol
of Magadha's pride is'
'the flag of Magadha.'
Hey..
What is the most powerful
and dangerous strike
in a battle?
An attack on enemy's
confidence is the most powerful
and dangerous strike in a battle.
And for that,
it is important to hurt enemy's ego.
Because when a person's
ego gets hurt
he loses his conscience
in the heat of the moment.
He goes crazy
and makes such decisions
which lead to his defeat
and your victory.
Hence, remember one thing.
Hurting enemy's ego
proves more effective
than any weapon.
Teachings are mine.
Decisions are yours.
No one can come to know about our
plans and dare to break the conspiracy.
I am sure that soldier has done it.
Move ahead.
This is the moment I was
waiting for long time.

================================================================================

Episode: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2ZI4rz8FdY

No!
That soldier is proving
to be an ace of spades for us.
Not only he made
the army of Magadha bite dust
he also burnt their flag
and shattered their morale.
It seems I have to go
to the front, Amatya.
Advance!
- Attack!
'Once the ego of Dhananand
gets a beating'
'then he will not be able
to stop himself'
'from taking part
in the battle.'
'And if Dhananand
enters the fight'
'then Selucus
will also follow suit.'
This was the moment
I was waiting for.
Today, I will make sure
to avenge my insults
and I will prove that
I am much more capable
then you to rule
this country, Dhananand!
Attack with force!
'What you had predicted'
'the same is happening,
Acharya.'
'Chandragupta, remember
'that we need to make
them fight with each other.'
Today I will take my vengeance
on you, Dhananand!
And I will increase the insult
I heaped on you, two folds..
Selucus!
What happened?
The Greek warrior has bite dust
in front of Magadha!
Along with your defeat
accept the fact
that the only king
to rule India is me.
No!
You are not capable
of becoming the king
of entire of India.
This is the moment
which I was waiting
for a long time.
The course of wind is changing.
Something is going to happen.
Good that you showed up.
I will personally punish you
for revolting in Magadha.
It is my wish to burn you
and your empire to ashes.
And I will make sure to do that today.
That is the sound
to stop the battle for the day.
Soldiers cover the
Your Highness, fast!
Stop that soldier.
Leave me!
, Let's go.
- Leave me.
Acharya.
How can this happen?
According to the rules
of a battle
as the sun sets, the battle
is stopped for the day.
This battle will continue
tomorrow morning.
And I wish
that tomorrow's sunrise
will see the last days of all
these three torturous kings.
And tomorrow's sunrise
will shine
with a new vision
for this country.
Let me go!
- Come back!
I will kill him right now!
So many years of waiting
got wasted
by today's break in the battle
and a mere sunset!
Dhananand..
He escaped death from me!
Had I got some more time
his death would have
been imminent with my hands!
Do not be disappointed,
Chandragupta.
Today, you have caused damage
to two big armies alone.
You were confined in a dark
tunnel for five years.
Even then a trained army
could not counter you.
Nor will Dhananand be
able to counter you.
Today, he has survived
due to ceasefire.
But tomorrow,
you will kill him for sure.
You are right, Mahisha.
Tomorrow,
I will kill all of them.
Acharya, what are you thinking?
Extreme situations give rise
to extreme thoughts.
Now, Selucus and Ambiraj
must be struggling
with their negative thoughts.
Today, they have suffered
massive loss in the battle.
And they might be
thinking
of surrendering.
They want to end this war
at any cost.
And all our plans will fail
if the battle does not
commence tomorrow.
Chandragupta, you need to go
to them tonight itself.
And you have to convince them
to continue this battle.
Encourage them.
And assure them
that they will win this battle.
Because that is the only way
to execute your plan
successfully which you started today.
Enough!
Can you not see
that he is in pain?
Let him do this, Father.
I want my shoulder
to recover soon.
So that I can end
the war tomorrow
and take revenge
on Dhananand's brothers.
You will not take part
in the battle anymore.
You need treatment and rest.
- But..
I get a hint of defeat
from your words.
Are you disappointed?
You are right.
But you are not trying
to know the reason
behind my disappointment.
We have suffered a massive loss
on the first day of the war.
Our every soldier is injured.
God knows
what will happen tomorrow.
Excuse me, the King of Takshashila.
But I do not agree with you.
Quitting the battle
cannot be an option.
Because we have the
upper hand in the battle.
We are on the verge
of winning this battle.
Keep quiet.
How are you interfering
in our conversation?
My son hired you as a soldier.
And you protected my son
in the battlefield.
It does not mean
that you consider
yourself worthy
of discussing politics with me.
Remember that you are
an ordinary soldier
not an expert in war strategy.
Please excuse me,
Your Highness. But..
But I have come here
to express my gratitude to you
King Selucus
and Prince Ambikumar.
I got an chance to fight
with an enemy like Dhananand
because of all of you.
Had the war not ended today
because of the sunset
I would have killed
Dhananand today itself.
I like your spirit.
I have seen your passion
of killing Dhananand in your eyes.
Tell us the reasons why
we should continue this war.
The reasons are clear.
I know that our army has suffered
a massive loss in the battle.
But our enemy has suffered
more loss than us.
We have won today's battle.
If you are injured,
so is Dhananand
The damage you caused
him today..
He must be yearning to take
revenge like an injured tiger.
Take the medicine away
from me.
This ointment cannot
heal my wounds.
Only the blood of my enemies
can heal my wounds
which I will shed
in the battlefield tomorrow
especially the blood
of that soldier.
Had he not been there
I would have captured
Takshashila by the sunset.
And I
would have captured
16 other
kingdoms as well.
Chief Minister,
keep our army ready.
We will
attack our enemies
with the
first light of the sun.
And make
an effective strategy.
So that
Takshashila surrenders
to us on their own.
I have already
made the strategy.
But it is not as per your
expectation, Your Highness.
But considering the time
and the situation
I think it will be
beneficial for us.
What is your strategy?
The same strategy
which Lord Krishna opted for.
At the beginning,
no one understood the strategy.
But finally, the entire universe
witnessed the result.
Great!
This is the best strategy
if you want the desired result.
And I am sure
that we will kill our enemies
in the battlefield tomorrow.
Are you even aware
of what you are saying?
This is not a strategy
but the euphoria of the day
of this soldier.
You are naive
and not experienced.
My years of experience says
that we should stop
this battle right now.
A battle is won with understanding,
strategy and with presence of mind..
And not only with passion.
We are not in a position
of taking more battering.
Your.. Your views
are right, King of Takshashila.
But any fight which
is not won by the heart
till then the battle
remains incomplete.
This entire battle depends
on the ways of the heart.
As it is said, you lose
when your heart sinks
and you win when
your heart gets aggressive.
Why are you forgetting
that we have with us
the mighty King Selucus
to show us the way
in front of whom the identity
of the great Alexander is small.
Half of the world is lying
under his feet.
Think about it..
Stalling a battle midway
will destroy
his prestige and honour.
The armoury and the soldiers
can be replenished
but a destroyed honour
and prestige of King Selucus
will go down
in the annals of history.
The coming generation
and his descendants
will not praise King Selucus
for his victory
but will remember him
for his retreat and surrender.
And Dhananand will be known
as the victorious ruler.
He is right, Ambiraj.
I do not want to repeat the
mistake I had made in Asaka.
I will not retreat!
Especially, when Dhananand
has gain stronghold.
I cannot lose respect
in front of my descendants.
Get the army ready.
Tomorrow, we fight
and win the battle!
Tomorrow will be known
as the defeat of Dhananand
and the victory of Selucus!
'No, Selucus.'
'Tomorrow, the names of yours'
'Dhananand and Ambiraj
will be wiped out forever.'
'History will
see that all three
of you had died tomorrow.'
This is the sound
of Dhananand advancing.
'The advancing of Dhananand
shows a new conspiracy'
'but what is his motive?'
A cuckoo never builds
its own nest.
She nestles herself
and lays eggs
in other bird's nest
by throwing off the eggs.
Oblivious of the fact
what the cuckoo did
the other bird considers
the eggs in the nest to be hers,
she nestles them.
This way,
not only the cuckoo
protects her eggs
she also protects the nest.
This rule can also be
strategized in a battle.
If you fear insecure
then retreat in the dwelling
of your enemy.
This way, you will escape
the attack of the enemy
and also be protected
from other enemies.
And then,
when the time is right
take up position
and conquer the enemy.
Remember that a guerrilla battle
is more beneficial
than a head-on attack.
My principles.
Your actions.
Coming of enemy in the tent
after end of war
is not a good sign for our plans.

================================================================================

Episode: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM1WqUuGlwk

This is the signal
of Dhananand's arrival.
What does Dhananand want?
Dhananand is a cunning man.
He can cross any limit
to fulfil his desire.
His entering
the enemy's camp at night
after the battle
has ended for the day
does not seem
good for our plan.
The break in the battle
after the sunset
is not for resting
but for planning
and thinking. I did the same.
That is why
I have come here.
What was so important
that you could not wait
for the morning,
King of Magadha?
Kings fight on the
battlefield, King Seleucus.
Their conversations
take place in privacy.
But only if you permit.
Of course. Come.
Come.
Boy!
I want
you to participate
in this conversation.
He was the shining star
of today's battle.
Otherwise,
Seleucus, you would have..
Oh, Lord..
Am I right?
I am sure
that you will not object
to his presence.
Start the conversation,
Amatya Rakshas.
Yes, Your Highness.
You all must admit
that in one day
both our armies
have suffered harm
and loss
due to this battle.
If your soldiers have perished
then ours have died too.
Both of our armies
have been harmed.
In every five years,
King Dhananand has fought
many battles
and won them.
But he has never seen a battle like
this which is full of bloodshed.
What is your name, boy?
I am Arya,
the son of Aryavarta.
Arya!
It is a nice name.
Arya?
- Yes, my Lady.
He is a cunning man.
I get angry
when I think of his cunningness.
You know..
First, he fooled me.
He fooled me!
Later he impressed Prince Ambikumar.
He made the prince
to give him a place in the army.
I thought
that it would not matter
as he will not be able
to fight the battle at all.
But he knows
how to wield the weapons!
Not only that,
but he knows the art of warfare.
Moreover, when
the prince was about to die
he saved him
from Dhananand's brothers.
He turned
the tide of the battle.
He defeated
hundreds of soldiers alone.
It seemed
as if he was a mighty warrior.
Tell me more.
What did Arya do?
My Lady, well..
- Yes.
Tell me.
Yes, my Lady. Many things
happened during the battle.
Both the armies
were severely harmed.
No, Stulbhadra. I am not
asking about the battle.
I asked about that boy.
What did he do?
My Lady, it seems
that he is foolish.
The battle
was about to end.
But I wonder
what he thought
that he burnt the flag
of the King of Magadha.
The burning
of the flag of Magadha
is equivalent
to hurting Dhananand's pride.
That is it.
Dhananand entered the fray.
After that,
they fought ferociously.
I saw such a ferocious fight
after many years.
He gave Dhananand
serious competition.
For a few moments,
I was stunned.
It seemed as if one of them
was about to be defeated
when the battle
ended for the day.
But even after that,
it was difficult to stop both of them.
'Come on, Chandragupta!'
'It is time to leave.
- No, Acharya!'
'Leave me!
I will not leave!'
'Let me go!
Either I will kill Dhananand'
'or he will kill me!'
'But I will not
run from here. Let me go!'
My Lady..
My Lady!
My Lady.. Your hand..
I have to meet Arya right away.
But, my Lady..
Listen to me. You..
I will listen to you,
but not now.
First, take me to that boy.
Come on.
My Lady,
you need a physician!
You are a great warrior.
I loved your courage.
Why did you all stop?
Keep conversing.
I was saying that both
the armies have endured harm.
So, after taking it
into consideration
and discussing it
we have decided
that we should
form an alliance.
What!
That is why King Dhananand has
come here with this proposal.
Your proposal
is commendable.
We thought the same,
but..
King Seleucus thought
that King Dhananand
would not accept
the proposal of an alliance.
You are right.
Earlier, our king
was not in favour of it.
But he is a generous king.
Difficult situations
and the wounded soldiers
melted his heart.
He decided
to stop the bloodshed
and find a solution to this
problem through a treaty.
It would save thousands of
lives of both the armies.
What would be the terms
of stopping this war?
What do you want
in return?
Taxila was yours
and it will always remain so.
Just give us the land
that you have forcibly
assimilated into Taxila.
The Paurava Kingdom.
This treaty is beneficial
for both parties.
We will get what we want
and your subjects
will remain safe.
Because after that,
we will never attack Taxila.
So, tell us. Do you accept this
proposal or not?
'No. Do not accept it..
Seleucus, do not accept it.'
I accept it.
It seems that you are not
happy with this treaty, Arya.
Do you like waging war
more than saving lives?
Tell me..
Do you want to see
your hands covered with blood?
Do you want
to see more corpses?
'I want the corpses
of the three of you.'
You have placed your terms.
But even we have a condition.
We want Taxila's prince,
Ambikumar, to wed
Magadha's princess, Durdhara.
Seleucus!
How dare you!
Hurry up, Stulbhadra.
But why do you want
to meet him?
He is a cunning
and arrogant boy.
He was going to kill
our biggest enemy.
That is why
I want to meet him.
Do you even know
whom you are talking about?
She is Magadha's princess.
I love her more than my life.
How can I let
my sister marry him?
How can I
let my sister marry
someone as weak as him?
How can you
even think about it, Seleucus?
Let alone my sister's hand
he is not worthy
of even holding a sword!
Dhananand!
If you had even nicked
him with your sword
I swear upon Lord Shiva,
I would have killed all of you!
Get up..
Today, you have broken the hand
of the Prince of Taxila.
Tomorrow, after getting
the Paurava Kingdom
you might want
to rule over Taxila.
That is why I want
your sister to marry Ambikumar.
Your anger
is for nothing, my friend.
This is for your benefit.
If you get your sister
married to Ambikumar
not only the
Paurava Kingdom will be yours
but in a sense,
even Taxila will be yours.
With this wedding,
Magadha and Taxila
will come together
to form familial bonds.
When your sister
becomes Taxila's queen
I will be sure that
you will never attack us again.
'Dhananand will never let his sister
marry a Kshatriya prince.'
So, what is your decision?
I accept this proposal!
Boy..
It seems
that you are not happy
with this treaty and bond.
I want to see
you happy as well.
I congratulate Magadha
and Taxila on this treaty.
Listen!
Where are you going?
- I have good news.
I am going to the palace
to deliver the same.
The war between Taxila
and Magadha has ended.
King Dhananand,
King Seleucus and King Ambhiraj
have conferred
and formed this treaty.
Moreover, King Dhananand
is going to be welcomed
into Taxila
with great pomp tomorrow.
I will take your leave.
No. This cannot happen.
If Dhananand comes to Taxila
many lives will be ruined.
Many houses
will be shattered.
Many families
will be destroyed.
I will not let that happen.
What do you mean,
my Lady?
I mean
that when
Dhananand comes to Taxila
instead of being welcomed
he will be killed.
I will kill him.
If I sow the seed
of mango in summer
take care of it
by watering it on time
and hope
that the seed
that I sowed in summer
gives me fruits
during winter
will that be possible?
No.
No matter
when I planted it
or took care of it
by watering it
it will bear fruits
only during the right season.
Similarly, in life
if you have put
in a lot of hard work
but you did not succeed
you should
not lose hope.
Keep trying
because many times
the fruit of success
is not earned
on the basis of hard work
but at the right time.
My ethics..
Your destiny.
The time has come Chandragupt to create
an integral and undivided India.
You have to punish Dhananand for his sins.
I am coming Dhananand.

================================================================================

Episode: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpo63T5x8OE

Ma'am.
Ma'am, what you are planning
to do is suicide.
Ma'am, killing Dhananand
during his welcome ceremony
is impossible.
The security is so tight there
that not even a bird
can break in, let alone humans.
No matter what, Stul.
I will definitely kill
Dhananand.
I will not let him destroy
another warriors' kingdom
no matter
whether I live or die.
I will not let him do this
to Paurav kingdom
what he did to Piplivan!
I am unable to understand
why Dhananand asked
for Paurav kingdom
in this treaty.
And how can this treaty
be so important for him
that he even accepted the marriage
proposal for his sister, Durdhara?
And that too with a warrior prince.
For Dhananand, Paurav kingdom
is not just a part of a land.
He is deeply connected
to Paurav kingdom.
Dhananand witnessed the strength
of the Paurav kingdom
with his own eyes.
The strength, which made
Alexander the Great
go back empty handed.
Not just this. Paurav kingdom
has strategic importance too.
The nature has provided
a special security to Paurav.
On one side,
there is Jhelum River
and on the other side,
chain of mountains.
It is very difficult
for the enemy to enter.
Everyone knows that Dhananand
is greedy for power.
He would not want to let
this opportunity to increase
his predominance
by establishing his lordship
in Paurav kingdom, ruled by Puru
which is a symbol of the dignity
of the warriors.
This one reason
is enough for us as well
to stop Dhananand.
We will have to stop this treaty
proposal at any cost.
But if Dhananand
reaches Taxila tomorrow
then this treaty
will definitely take place.
Then no one will be able
to stop this treaty.
Chandragupta, if you have
the knowledge of your goal
then you will definitely
find the path.
Just think.
We just need
only one opportunity
to stop Dhananand.
Any one opportunity by which
we can kill Dhananand.
Any such doubt, which can come
in Dhananand's mind.
Sir.
What if Dhananand
is attacked tomorrow
during the ceremony?
What do you mean?
I mean, after this attack,
he will feel like this attack
must have been done
by Ambhiraj or Seleucus.
And their fear of betrayal
will become the reason
of this treaty to break.
Excellent, Chandragupta.
We will undoubtedly do this.
We will have a plan to make
a fake attack on Dhananand.
And our this plan will destroy
Dhananand's plan.
Everything will be destroyed.
P-Please think once again.
T-The promise I made to Chandra
that I will protect you.
Your goal to provide guidance
to the youth
and the oath to give this
country a bright future
everything will be destroyed.
P-Please do not do this.
Stul.
Maybe this is my destiny.
Maybe I am destined to get
this result
of my hard work
from so many years.
Stulbhadra, look into my eyes.
Can you see even a bit of fear
or hesitation?
No, right?
Because I am ready.
I do not at all care, whether I
will be able
to witness
tomorrow's sunrise or not.
But I will definitely make sure
that tomorrow's sunrise
becomes the last sunrise
in Dhananand's life.
Your chariot is ready,
Your Highness.
Ambhiraj and Seleucus
must be waiting for us.
And everyone in Taxila
must be eagerly waiting
for your grand
and divine welcome.
Eagerly waiting.
Amatya, all this became possible
only because of your suggestion.
The Taxila, which I was even
ready to burn to acquire it
the same Taxila is eagerly
waiting to welcome me.
Amazing.
And all this without any battle.
This is the real politics.
What happened, Amatya?
You do not seem to be happy.
I am sorry, Your Highness
but my happiness is incomplete.
I have a doubt
that Princess Durdhara
will not accept this
marriage proposal so easily.
Even I have an intuition
that we will not get
Durdhara's acceptance easily.
But the truth
is that my dear sister
has left from Magadha for
Taxila on her brother's request.
I hope that my sister will get
rid of her hatred towards me
and will comply
with my decision.
Besides, whatever I did in the
past five years
was for her.
Today, I will fulfil
the promise that I gave her.
By gifting her
all the 16 districts.
Possibly, I can be a good
emperor for her.
Possibly,
I can become a brother
to her again.
These are not beautiful, Shipra.
These are not, either.
Princess, you've already
rejected so much jewellery.
Choose one of them.
You will have to be go to Taxila as
the sister of a great emperor.
You cannot take so much
time to get ready.
P-Please forgive me for talking
so much.
Look, everyone is waiting
for you over there.
According to the emperor's orders
you have to be present there.
Forgive me for what I said.
Forget about it.
The jewellery is not
that important.
Your presence is important.
So, forget what I said
and forgive me.
Only God knows what will happen in
the emperor's welcome assembly today.
Today, Dhananand
would be attacked
during the welcome assembly.
The people of Taxila would
witness the attack.
You will begin the plan,
Mahesha.
You will shoot an arrow at
Dhananand during the assembly.
But because of staying
in that pit
since many years, I have
lost practice.
I might miss the target.
You do not have to hit
at the target.
You just have to show
that his life is in danger.
Besides, you would not
have been able
to hit Dhananand even if
you were the best
archer in the world.
But he will be caught
if he shoots the arrow.
There might be many
soldiers there.
You are right but if the
soldiers get distracted
it will not happen.
How?
We will create an illusion.
Mahesha, hide here
and shoot an arrow at Dhananand.
The people of Taxila
and the soldiers will be here.
Chandragupta will
do an harmless
attack against them
to distract them.
There would be a stampede.
All the soldiers will
scatter around.
Use the stampede to escape.
Now, Dhananand is left.
He will be scared.
He will reject
this treaty
based on suspicion.
According to him,
the attack must
have been done on him
by Ambhiraj or Seleucus.
Have you all understood
the plan?
Yes..
- Yes.
Come, let us go towards
the palace.
Let us go and give Dhananand
the welcome that he deserves.
Emperor Dhananand
would reach the palace soon.
Good. We must make sure that
he has no objection against us.
Everything should
happen peacefully.
Hail King Seleucus.
Hail King Seleucus.
Hail King Seleucus.
Hail King Seleucus.
Hail King Seleucus.
Hail King Seleucus.
I have already observed
this place.
According to the distance
between you
and Dhananand and the
soldiers in between
you will get only one
chance to attack him.
If you hit the target, it would
be good.
But if you miss, do not attack
again.
The soldiers might find
out where you are.
It would be difficult for you
to escape.
That is why, you cannot
attack again.
D-Do you understand?
You cannot attack..
Hey..
You have supported me
since so many years.
You also fulfilled the duties
of a son.
My blessings will always
be with you.
Y-You are talking like
everything will end.
We have to live more.
Did you forget that you
have to feed me
so much food and sweets?
Did you forget that?
I will be waiting for you
and the food prepared by you.
'Chandragupta, I am hoping that
you will reach there on time.'
Hail Emperor Dhananand!
Hail Emperor Dhananand!
Hail Emperor Dhananand!
Hail Emperor Dhananand!
Hail Emperor Dhananand!
Welcome to you,
Emperor Dhananand.
Welcome to you.
- My friend..
Welcome to Taxila.
History will always remember
today's date.
And I consider myself fortunate
that we will be known
as friends from today onwards.
I have got a treaty prepared
in order to strengthen
our friendship.
I do not want our friendship
to turn sour due to any reason.
Please take your time
to read the treaty.
After that, it will be mutually
approved by both of us.
Please come.
'Chandragupta, hurry up.'
'We need to strike
before they approve the treaty.'
Stop.
What are you doing here?
Forget about me.
Tell me what you are doing here.
Me..
I need to keep an eye
on every place.
I leave no stone unturned
to serve my emperor.
Got it? But you..
You are always at the wrong
place at the wrong time.
Why is that?
It is very crowded outside.
Hence, I thought of witnessing
this historical moment
from a high tower.
So I have come here.
Go from here.
If you do not go from here,
I will..
I will signal the soldiers
and call them here by whistling.
After that, they will
hold you captive.
Friend, calm down..
Listen to me.
I am leaving..
Why are you taking the trouble?
Shall I tell you something?
I do not argue with you because
you remind me of someone.
Otherwise, I..
- What will you do?
Wait.
- I already told you that I am leaving.
It is a small thorn.
But if it pricks
in someone's heel
he is forced to change
his path.
Similarly, to defeat an enemy
sometimes, it just needs a strategy or move
that forces the enemy
to change his strategy
and ensures your victory.
One small attempt of yours
can give
you a better result
without even using power
or weapon.
Teachings are mine.
Decisions are yours.
Run!
- Acharya..
Someone has injured Dhananand.
We will have to protect
whosoever he is.
Before the soldiers find
that person you go and find
and take that person
to a safe place.

================================================================================

Episode: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c-2vxoVepVE

What're you doing here?
You should've been over there.
There was a solider there,
Acharya. He stopped me..
Don't worry about it.
I've found another spot.
Acharya, you must stop Mahisha
until I reach that spot.
Don't worry about it. I'll pass
the message. You go ahead.
Well enough.
Amazing! If I would've
made this alliance proposal
it wouldn't have been as great
as you've made it.
This proposal of alliance
has all the rules and conditions
that we've discussed about.
I'm so glad
that we came to an agreement.
What can I say?
This is foundation of our friendship.
So I had to get it done right.
You're absolutely right.
Now a final job
let's seal the
alliance proposal.
'Oh, God!
He's about to seal the deal.'
Where did the arrow come from?
Protect him..
- Your Highness..
Who would dare to hurt..
Soldiers, protect the king. Right now!
Spread out and find the culprit.
Mr. Chanakya..
Somebody attacked Dhananand.
And it's not Mahisha.
Whoever it is,
we must protect that person.
Before soldiers find him,
you find him first and keep him safe.
Go..
- Yes.
Stop right there!
I've checked here already.
There's nobody here.
Arrow was shot from the north.
And the fastest route out
of here is in the same direction.
Go and check over there.
He's the same solider. It seems
like he has spotted Mura.
I must stop him.
Everyone, stop right here.
What's wrong, Solider?
Why did you stop
princess's convoy?
We've got
king's function to attend.
That too, right now..
King Dhananand was attacked.
We've been ordered
to protect your convoy.
Mura?
'What is Chandragupta's
mother doing here?'
'I wonder if she
attacked my brother.'
Ma'am, it's me..
Oh! Stulbhadra?
I just witnessed a miracle.
Someone just saved me.
Who cares, Ma'am? Let's go..
But Stulbhadra, I-I..
We'll look into it later,
Ma'am. Let's go for now.
How dare you..
- Amazing!
You attacked Emperor Dhananand
but you dare to question me.
Strange.
You all..
Now that I captured
the attacker
you all are here
with your swords.
Remember, I caught her.
I will take her to the Emperor.
I do not need anyone's help.
What are you doing?
Let me go.
'I will have to come up
with some other plan'
'to take her away
from these people.'
Do as I say.
Come with me.
Be quiet.
Okay?
Come!
Ma'am we should not
stay here for long.
It will not be safe.
Did you see that soldier?
Did you see how loyal he is
to Selucus and Ambiraj.
He could have caught you today.
We were lucky.
We managed to escape.
You..
You wanted to meet him, right?
I told you, he is very crooked.
That man will not stop for long.
He will soon try to find
the real attacker.
We should not stay here
any longer.
Come.
I have also arranged for a boat
so that we can get out of here safely.
Come.
- No.
I will not go anywhere.
But that man..
He will not spare you.
It is not about him.
That girl..
I want to know who that girl was.
Why did she want to help me?
That soldier..
He will take that girl
to Dhananand soon.
I do not want anyone to be sentenced
to death because of me.
No.
I will not let that happen.
What?
A lady attacked Dhananand?
Who can she be?
Whoever she is, I do not think
that she will survive.
I do not think
that even Chandragupta
can save her from Taxila's
security.
Mahisha!
He is Chandragupta.
He will find out a solution.
Listen.
I will distract the soldiers
and you can escape.
If I had to run away, trust me,
you would not have been
able to catch me.
Understood?
- You are delusional.
If I want to catch someone,
that person cannot escape.
Besides,
you do not look like
a revolutionary.
Seeing your delicate hands,
it seems like
you paint, not fight.
Seeing your delicate feet
it seems like
you have walked only on carpets.
Besides
revolutionists
do not wear
such beautiful anklets.
All the warriors
need not look rude like you.
Understood?
This broad chest,
long hair
strong shoulders
like a horse..
Do you think all this is necessary
to look like a warrior?
The world has changed.
But after looking at you
I think you have come from a dark
cave and not from here.
Yes.
Your guess can be correct too.
But only this man
who has come from the cave
can save your life now.
So, listen to me carefully.
These soldiers will take
a left turn ahead.
And you take a right turn
all of a sudden and run away.
Take this.
Keep it with you.
You may need it
for your safety.
I will handle them.
Okay?
Listen, this is
the right moment.
Run away from there.
Hurry up.
Take this.
I do not need your help.
I am not scared
of the king.
I want to look into
his eyes and face him.
I salute your bravery.
But you are underestimating
Dhananand's cruelty.
And you are
underestimating me.
What happened?
Nothing.
She is just showing
some attitude.
You guys keep moving.
I will handle her.
What happened?
Why are you smiling?
Very few people
have this passion.
You are not among them.
It was my pleasure meeting you.
Well, I want to see
want Dhananand does
to his murderer.
But yes,
do not blame me later
that I had not warned you
or I had not helped you.
Understood?
I will not say that.
Instead, both of us
need not see each other
or talk to each other.
Your Majesty, going by
the time and circumstance
according to me
this is right.
I have sent a huge portion of the
army to catch the attacker.
He will be in front of you very soon.
You might have sent
that attacker.
What are you saying?
- Why?
What is wrong
in this possibility?
You might have invited me
to your kingdom for a treaty
and planned my death.
The land is yours.
The people are yours.
So, this decision
could be yours too.
What nonsense
are you talking, King?
Mind your language,
King Selucus.
Do not forget that you are
talking to King Dhananand.
The King Dhananand
whose anger
gives tremors to the earth.
His roar frightens
the sky too.
We have not connection
with this incident.
This has been done by those people
who do not want the treaty
to be completed between
Magadha and Takshashila.
The truth does not
need any evidence, Ambiraj.
I do not know
who attacked me and why.
But this has happened
on your land.
So, now the treaty
will take place
but without any conditions.
Amatya Rakshas.
- You are right, Your Majesty.
King Dhananand
was attacked on your land.
Keeping this in mind
you will have to handover
the Paurava Dynasty
to King Dhananand.
So, the wedding proposal
between Princess Durdhara
and Prince Ambikumar
will be cancelled.
But the treaty was decided
based on this condition.
I had already
made it clear
that there should not be
any hindrance in my welcome.
But many things
have taken place here today.
Now, face the outcome.
And as far as
the attacker is concerned
once he is found
I will kill him
in front of everyone
so that your subjects also see
what happens to one who comes
in the path of King Dhananand.
Look at this thread.
This thread has held
all the stones
of this chain together.
In a person's life
relationships are also
like these stones
and the thread
that holds them together are
your honour and respect.
But if this thread
which is a form of respect
breaks
even the relationships
will fall apart
like these stones.
So, remember one thing.
The secret behind maintaining
any relationship is
the respect and honour
towards the other person.
The teachings are mine
and the destiny is yours.
Selucus Arya has
arrested that attacker.
He must be here any moment.
Durdhara.

================================================================================

Episode: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzI2XX_2ftM

I was attacked
in your territory.
Now,
a treaty will be signed,
but without any condition.
As far as the attacker
is concerned
I myself will kill him in public
if he is found.
So that even your subjects
can witness
the consequences
of coming in my way.
King Seleucus, Arya has
captured the attacker.
He will be here soon.
Present him here immediately.
Look there, Emperor Dhananand.
Arya is bringing
the attacker here.
Did you see, Emperor Dhananand?
As I told you,
we have a good intention
behind this friendship.
The real attacker
is in front of you.
Had we been behind this attack
our gallant soldier, Arya,
would not have tried so
hard to capture her.
Arya, bravo!
Not just you have proved
your mettle in the battlefield
but also in the real life.
Emperor Dhananand wants to kill
the attacker on his own.
She is in front of you.
Punish her.
'I have never seen'
'such an idiot and a brave
lady in my life before.'
Get her down.
Okay.
I wish you let me help you.
As I told you earlier,
I do not need your help.
Show me your face.
Follow the order
of the emperor.
Durdhara!
Princess!
'Durdhara!'
Have you understood now
why I did not escape?
Durdhara.
My darling sister.
My darling sister
is my shadow, Seleucus.
Her behaviour
and her personality
are just like mine.
Whenever she enters
any place
everyone gets shocked.
Look at this.
She made your entire army
follow her
as soon as she came here.
My sister is mischievous
and playful.
Durdhara, whatever
you did today is really amazing.
And only you can do this.
Do not worry
about this wound.
It is a small wound.
It will heal in sometime.
But the happiness
of this treaty has increased
after your arrival.
You will not utter
a word now.
What happened?
Why did all of you stop?
Continue the celebration,
Seleucus.
Now, even my sister will witness
this historic treaty.
Come, let us put the seal of our
friendship on this treaty.
Dhananand, I am calling off
this treaty now.
You and your sister
tried to play a game with me.
Did you think you will acquire
the entire Paurava Dynasty
as per your conditions
and without the wedding
of Ambhikumar and Durdhara?
My special soldier was there.
If he would not catch
your sister today
your plan would definitely
succeed today.
You should not have played
this game, Dhananand.
This is not right.
Okay.
Tomorrow's day will begin
with a war
and it will end
with your destruction.
Remember this.
Tomorrow will be
everyone's last day.
Why just
the Paurava Dynasty?
Even Taxila
will be mine now.
This land will remain here.
But there will be
nobody tomorrow
who will take your name.
'So, Acharya Chanakya
and my plan has succeeded.'
'I will kill all three of them'
'and lay the foundation
of an independent India.'
Lady, after what
happened today
I think we should be alert
for few days.
If you take my advice
do not step out
of the hermitage
for the next few days.
Lady.
Lady.
I have been talking to you
from a very long time.
Did you not hear anything?
Stul, I do not understand
why Durdhara protected me.
What does she want?
Chandragupta.
I want Chandragupta.
I have to find him.
If Mura is alive and she is
here in Taxila
that means, Chandragupta
must also be here.
Princess, it is better
to forget the past.
Look, playing with past
is like playing with fire.
That very fire is singeing me,
Shipra.
The fire of guilt.
I have not been able to douse
it in the last five years.
But enough now.
Now I have to meet
Chandragupta
and tell him that what he
said about my brother
is all true.
He is right and I am wrong.
And I am sorry
for betraying him.
I am sorry
for supporting
my brother instead of him.
But now I do not want
to lose this golden chance.
I will find Chandragupta.
But we were instructed that we
have to leave from here tonight.
The war will start again
tomorrow, Princess.
I am not worried about the war,
Shipra.
I am just worried about
finding Chandragupta.
I want to get this weight
of guilt off my chest.
I have been looking
for him for so long.
Durdhara.
We are in this state today
because of Durdhara's betrayal!
Because of her, Chandra
is not with..
Look, I do not know what her
motive behind saving you was.
Durdhara and Dhananand are
mirror images of each other.
They are still as cunning
as they were five years ago.
You attacked your own brother?
You want to kill me?
Fine.
Take this knife and kill me.
Fulfil your wish.
You do not need a secret
attack or a mask.
And yes,
no one will do anything
to you after you have killed me.
Because you have my
lifelong pardon.
Even after my death,
my promise will remain the same.
No one will ask you, Durdhara
why you killed the king.
That is why, do not think.
Take this knife
and kill your brother.
Take it.
That is what I wanted to see.
That means, you did not
attack me.
But you took someone else's
blame upon yourself, so that..
So that my enemy, that Seleucus,
turns against me.
First you used to insult
me in the Magadha Palace.
But now you have started interfering
in political matters.
Today, because of you, Durdhara
the person who attacked me escaped.
Because of you, Seleucus thinks
that it was yours and mine plan.
Because of you,
we are on the brink of war
that we had averted
on our conditions.
Why, my dear Sister, why?
Why do you do things
that hurt me?
For you,
I did everything
conquered 15 districts.
So that I can prove myself
a worthy emperor to you.
So that I can win your
love and affection again.
Repeating the same lie
will not make it true, King.
You conquered those 15 districts
not to earn my respect
but for your own pride.
You did it for your greed
of power and wealth.
Winning my affection
again is just an excuse
you are using
to sate your own greed.
You aspire to be the
supreme emperor
so that you could prove that
it was fair to murder father.
You wanted to prove yourself
worthy of the throne.
So don't waste more time
to prove your lie as truth.
Go ahead and prepare for
tomorrow's battle.
You are desperately
waiting for it.
Enough!
Enough of your
misbehaviour.
I will put an end to the
revolt that is brewing
in your mind, just the way
I put an end to the
person who ignited the
flame of revolt in you.
Yes, I mean Chandragupta!
Like I ended him!
'What do you feel?
that I am a foolish princess
'who will be impressed by
your words and stay'
'as your prisoner.'
'I did this to hoodwink you.'
'My brother will be here soon
and finish all of you.'
I can understand that your
unpleasant memories
might have freshened up
after seeing Durdhara.
The painful
memories of the past
must have been recollected again.
Do you know, Acharya?
After spending five
years in the dark dungeon
I felt a lot might have changed
in this world.
But I was wrong.
Some people do not change.
Dhananand and Durdhara
are the same even now.
Liars, untrustworthy..
Everything is the same,
Acharya.
Even time could not
change them.
Neither did I change, nor has
my lover towards you changed.
I have always had a soft
corner for you.
But now, it is
time for me to change that.
From the past five years,
I had always remembered
you as my good old, fond sister
but you did not consider me as
your brother.
You just considered me as
an emperor.
Okay,
from now on,
I will behave with you like an emperor.
At this time it is not important
to find out
Dhananand's and Durdhara's
next move.
It is more important to find out
who attacked Dhananand.
Because it is clear that
Durdhara did not attack
Dhananand
but somebody else did.
You are right, Acharya.
Whoever it is, cannot plan
such an prominent attack, all alone.
Undoubtedly!
Surely some traitor would be
involved with her.
Traitor!
'What are you
doing over here?'
'Forget about me, tell me
what are you doing here?'
'Me? I have to have an eye
on every nook and corner.'
Acharya, I think I know
that traitor.
Often a person gets deeply
hurt which he cannot
forgive with time and slowly
the same wounds
erases his personality.
Until when the wound is healed.
But many times, by the time
the wound heals
the very existences would
be destroyed.
So, one should free himself
from such wound well
in advance, to regain
your strength and protect
your identity like a shield
and get ready to face the
ups and downs of life.
Teachings are mine,
decisions are yours.
On seeing me you got scared as if I
have caught you doing something wrong.
I know that you are saving the one
who attacked Dhananand

================================================================================

Episode: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rt5fCGuwY6c

Tomorrow, I will fight
in the most historical battle
of this century
and I will win it as well.
After that,
I will become
the mightiest king
of this country.
What will you do?
Let me tell you.
You will follow
your king's order
sit on your palanquin
and leave
for Pataliputra tonight.
Did you get it?
Follow the order of Magadha!
Do you think I am insignificant
in front of you, King?
I will show you
my capability
and worthiness.
What happened?
On seeing me,
you became scared
as if you were
caught red-handed.
Whom were you talking to?
Me?
I was..
I was talking to my horse.
I was making
it understand
that it should stay away
from cunning people like you.
Cunning? Bhadra,
are you calling me cunning?
Did you not witness
my valour on the battlefield?
I did it to impress you.
I know that you are protecting
Dhananand's attacker.
Hey, you are insane.
If I was protecting
the attacker
why would I have
followed that person with you?
Look, you do not need
to pretend in front of me.
You did not
let me go to that place
because you were protecting
the real attacker.
I know everything.
If you know
who the real attacker was
and how
I helped that person
then go
and tell everything
to King Seleucus.
Perhaps, he will
be happy with you.
He might remove
Prince Ambikumar
from the post
of the army commander
and appoint you on that post.
Go on.. Hurry up.
You did not go.
You cannot go.
You do not have
the evidence.
Why are you smiling?
When I was young,
I had a friend like you.
He was heavy-set
and foolish.
He used to understand
many things
after a long time.
Look, do not try
to pretend
like you know me.
As far as my
childhood is considered
I do not like to talk
about it with everyone.
Arya, King Seleucus
has summoned you.
Go on..
Perhaps, King Seleucus
has summoned you
to appoint you as his commander.
Go.
Trap him in your sweet words.
Perhaps, you will
benefit from it.
Who can benefit me
better than you can?
There is something
special about him.
But what is he looking for?
He has an inkling of our plan
but why is he not
doing anything?
He wanted
to show off his intelligence.
He.. He is insane
and ambitious.
You are so pious
that you can
find goodness even in him.
Come on.
Let us go.
Princess,
this is a dangerous task.
Look, I have packed
your luggage.
Let us go from here.
Forget Chandragupta and Mura.
Come on!
Let us go!
No, Shipra.
After what the king
said to me today
I cannot even think
about leaving this place.
He compared me
to a caged bird.
He has questioned
my existence and me.
Now, I will show him
who I am
and what my worth is.
Tie it up.
So, the king thinks that women
have no place in politics.
But now, I will show him
what can happen
when a woman shows
active participation in politics.
Princess, listen to me!
Princess!
It was you
who advised me not to form
a treaty with Dhananand.
It was you who said
that we were about to win.
So, here you go.
This is your chance
to write your name in golden
letters in the pages of history.
Are you ready for it?
Dhananand will be here.
Where is she?
Is this a new trap, Princess?
We are about to fight
against your brother.
Yet, you have come here.
You are going to fight
against my brother.
Prince Ambikumar is not
going to fight against me.
I am here
to meet Ambikumar.
Shall I think
that you are here
to advocate
for King Dhananand?
I am here
to represent myself.
Prince Ambikumar and I will move
from here and here.
We will surround
the enemy from here.
All of you will surround
the enemy from this side.
In this way,
half the opposing army
will be decimated
in a few moments.
Without his army Dhananand
will be helpless.
Then we..
- My King!
Forgive me for intruding.
Someone is here
to meet Ambikumar.
Me?
Who is here
to meet me at this time?
It is I,
your fiancee, Prince.
Forgive me. Forgive me king.
I was doing my duty
as guard and I did not know
when the princess left the tent.
You don't know?
Forgive me king.
I will not make this mistake again.
Get lost!
Forgive me king.
Yes now you will never make a mistake.
No king!
Your silence tells me
that you did not
find Durdhara.
Am I right?
- No, Your Highness.
I may know where
Princess Durdhara has gone.
The Palace of Taxila.
Before she weakens
my position in the battle
we have to stop her,
Amatya Rakshas.
We have
to leave right away.
Yes, Your Highness.
Great! I am impressed
with this strategy.
How did you breach Taxila's security
and reach here, Princess?
Prince,
I am Magadha's princess.
I know how to reach
my destination.
I think we should stop before
taking this matter further.
Because it can
be disastrous for us
to speak to someone
from the opposition
just one night
before the battle.
Who gave you
the right to interfere?
I am Magadha's princess.
According to the rules
when royals are speaking
then people like you
who belong to the lower rank
should stand
quietly in a corner
and keep
their mouths shut.
Stop, soldier.
Princess, be clear about
your intentions of coming here.
I had cleared
my intentions
as soon as I came here,
King Seleucus.
I am here
as the fiancee of Ambikumar.
Prince, you have
the opportunity to marry me.
The opportunity to marry
the most beautiful girl
in the 16 districts of India.
My soft hands are compared
to the fragile petals of a rose.
I have always walked
on velvety carpets.
My beauty is mesmerising.
This opportunity
is knocking on your door.
But instead of taking
hold of your golden future
you are battling with your present
in this small room.
Do you not think
you let that opportunity slip by
which people dream about?
Hundreds of people
can kill each other
for this opportunity.
It is regrettable
that your calculations are weak.
You could not value beauty.
Do not listen to anyone.
Neither your father
nor King Seleucus.
Especially, do not listen
to that soldier.
Listen to your heart.
It will tell you
what you want.
Beware!
You cannot enter the palace!
I am sorry to disturb.
But since the princess of Magadha
has come here alone
so it is clear
that His Highness Dhananand
does not support this proposal.
That is why there is no
meaning of this proposal.
This soldier is right.
Even I am sure that Dhananand
will be against this.
He has declared this
in front of entire Taxila
that he will never let you
marry Ambikumar.
And the same people
of Taxila saw
that how much my brother loves me.
My wishes are no less
than orders for him.
And my wish
is to marry Ambikumar.
That is why, do not worry.
I will handle my brother.
You just tell me
whether you accept
my marriage proposal or not.
His Highness Dhananand
is coming here
and he seems to be very angry.
Your Highness, this is what
I was worried about.
Her Majesty Durdhara
came here
without informing
His Highness Dhananand.
And now, this has become
a reason for us to worry.
Move aside or just die!
If you will not move,
then the land of Taxila
will become full of blood!
Stop, Your Highness!
Please calm down.
These swords are not
required here anymore.
I did not want
to insult you.
I do not want you to fight
a battle because of me.
I will not let thousands
of soldiers die
and the mothers lose
their sons.
Battle gives us a history
full of blood
and the treaty gives us
a peaceful future.
I cannot see you wounded,
Your Highness.
And that is why
I have come here.
And even you are a special
reason for me to come here.
I am very sure
that if my brother would search
the whole world
then he would not find
a worthy man like you.
I have decided to find
a solution
by understanding
both sides.
And I did not find a solution
better than marriage.
Since the war situation
is created because of me
so I thought that even treaty
is my responsibility.
Prince.
- Soldier.
I agree with this solution.
And even I believe that love
is greater than any war.
It is a proper solution.
Your soft heart cannot
change the future.
Because now, it all depends
on the intentions
of the brother
of Princess Durdhara.
So, tell me,
Your Highness Dhananand.
What is your decision?
Please approve it, Brother.
And please help me become
free from this burden of guilt.
Have I ever disapproved
any of your wishes, Sister?
Never.
Okay.
I agree with this proposal
of my sister.
But the decision i
now yours, Seleucus.
Do you want to accept
this treaty
by becoming my friend,
or you want to fight
a battle with Magadha
by becoming my enemy?
I think this treaty
should not take place.
Because the sister
who attacked her brother
now wants to marry the son of her
enemy for her brother's welfare.
Everything taking place so easily
raises a doubt in the mind.
Your Majesty, I think
a war should be the solution.
Do not cross your limits.
This is not something
of your reach.
It is an important
and serious matter.
Remember one thing.
Do not cross your limits.
Father is absolutely right.
I think I made
the biggest mistake
by appointing you
in the army.
This is my last warning.
Do not interrupt
when the kings are talking.
Among all the solutions
there cannot be
a better solution than love.
And I am sure
that this wedding and this love
between me and the princess
will break all the walls of enmity.
Okay.
Since everyone
has accepted this proposal
the wedding should take place
as soon as possible.
Even I do not want
anything more than this.
Thank you, Brother.
I knew that you would never
say no to your darling sister.
'I will put an end to the fire of
opposition burning in your heart'
'just how I had put an end
to the person'
'who had lit the fire
of opposition in your heart.'
'Yes.'
'Just like Chandragupta, the traitor.'
'What will you do?'
'I will tell you.'
'You will obey the orders
of your king'
'and sit in your palanquin'
'and leave for Pataliputra
tonight itself.'
'Understood?'
This is what happens
when you underestimate a woman
and when you question
her identity.
Being a king you tried to make
me dance to your tunes.
You wanted to send me back
to Pataliputra.
But I thought I should go
to my husband's house
if I have to sit
in the palanquin.
It is better than my house
where I feel suffocated.
Sister, I have always
wished for your happiness.
I know, Brother.
Your love towards me
is my biggest strength.
People of Takshashila,
be happy.
King Seleucus
has passed an order
that we have to make
arrangements for a wedding
and not a war.
Play the drums.
We will have to stop
this wedding, Chandragupta
even if we have to do
anything for that.
If this wedding takes place
that cruel Dhananand
will easily get
the Paurava Dynasty.
I had ensured this
last night itself.
But..
- Have sweets.
Prince Ambikumar
and Princess Durdhara's
wedding has been fixed.
If Durdhara was
not here today
I would have
Dhananand's head in my hand
and not this sweet.
Calm down, Chandragupta.
How do I calm down,
Acharya?
Our entire plan has failed.
And that is because
Dhananand's darling sister
has fallen in love
with that stupid Ambikumar.
I do not trust Durdhara
anymore, Acharya.
Even I cannot believe this,
Chandra.
What do you mean?
Connect all the chain of events.
The entire situation
will be clear to you.
Dhananand was attacked
just before the treaty.
And when the army
of Takshashila
were about to catch
the attacker
Durdhara came in between
at the same moment
and surrendered herself
and took the blame on her.
This indicates towards
one thing.
The relationship between Dhananand
and Durdhara is not sweet like before.
Acharya, it is not evident
by looking at them
because they still share
the same bond
that they shared
five years ago.
Chandragupta, do not let
the cloud of emotions
block the light
of your thinking.
We will know the truth
when we find out
Durdhara's connection
with the woman attacker
and only Durjan Singh
knows the truth.
And you have to
find it out from him.
No, Acharya.
First, Ambikumar. Now, he..
How do I always have
to deal with these idiots?
He only looks stupid,
but he is not.
There is something
that he knows.
And you have to find out what it is.
Go after him.
Durdhara, no matter what
your intention is
I will not let it succeed.
The tighter I hold this rope
and the harder I try
to pull it towards me
the more it will harm
my hands.
And if I use more strength
it can break too.
The same rule applies
to human relationships too.
In a relationship
between two people
when one person tries
to dominate the other
or when one tries to control
the other person
it will definitely hurt the
other person
and the chances of
a relationship ending increases.
So, manage relationships
on the basis of cooperation
and not with the emotion
of rights.
The principles are mine
and the destiny is yours.
Why do you get angry on seeing me?
There is a strange
kind of tension between us.
Have we met before?

================================================================================

Episode: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48HRdvH0TUY

Princess, do you know
that I got this garden planted?
The most beautiful flowers
in the world bloom here.
Hey..But none of them
can match your beauty.
Your beauty is unparalleled.
Ambikumar,
is there any place in Taxila
that I have not seen?
A hermitage
and an old sanatorium are left.
But it is useless
to visit them, Princess.
I think you would
not like to go there.
Why not?
I am going
to be your wife.
This place is going
to become my home.
I want to know about
every nook and corner of Taxila.
'This is the only way
to find Mura'
'and reach Chandragupta.'
Of course.
I will fulfil your wish.
Come on, Princess. Let us go.
Your Highness,
the places that Princess Durdhara is
visiting with Prince Ambikumar
are being monitored
by our spies
and they are keeping
an eye on her.
I request you not to worry
about the princess safety.
It is my responsibility.
- No.
No, Amatya Rakshas.
I am not worried
about Durdhara's safety.
I am worried
about her motives
and intentions.
I do not want to know
my sister's whereabouts.
Instead, I want to know
what she is thinking.
What is she hoping
to achieve?
I did not understand,
Your Highness.
You did not understand,
Amatya Rakshas.
But I understand
my sister very well.
Durdhara is surely
planning something.
In all these years,
she has denied
the marriage proposals
of many suitable princes.
Now, she wants
me to believe
that she has fallen
for that foolish Ambikumar.
No.
There is something
that I am unable to understand.
Amatya Rakshas,
instruct our spies
to inform me
about Durdhara's every move
so that I can find out
what she is thinking.
As you say, Your Highness.
Excuse me.
Where is Durjan Singh?
Perhaps,
he is busy in the arrangements
of welcoming the
royal family of Magadha.
All these arrangements are being made
under his instructions.
'Only you can tell me
about who attacked Dhananand.'
What happened, soldier? No..
Arya. Am I right?
What happened, Arya?
Why do you get angry
upon seeing me?
Have we met before?
'I could not find
Mura in the sanatorium.'
'Perhaps, she is hiding
at the hermitage.'
Princess.
After inspecting
the sanatorium
you seem to have grown tired.
Come, let us go to the palace.
You can rest for some time.
- No.
I will not leave
without seeing the hermitage.
If you want, I can bring
the entire hermitage to you.
Can you do that?
- Yes.
Please send
the bodyguards
deployed by
Amatya Rakshas away.
They are not
allowing me to spend
even a moment
alone with you.
Who?
Hey!
Both of you come out!
Go and tell Amatya Rakshas
that I am capable
of protecting the princess.
If I see anyone
of you around the princess
I will consider it as my
that is the to-be
son-in-law of Magadha's insult.
Did you get it?
Leave!
Princess, I have
made them leave..
Where did she go?
She is King Dhananand's sister.
She will not
be controlled so easily.
The entire Taxila is happy
to hear the news of my
dear sister, Durdhara's marriage.
They seem clearly excited, but..
You seem to be feeling
something else.
Is it not strange?
I do not remember
if we have met before.
But still, we have a strange
tension
sparking between us.
You do not remain
normal in front of me.
But you are different than others.
When Taxila's army
was looking for Durdhara
and following her
only you could capture her.
I am pleased with your talent.
A talented person like you
should be with me.
So, tell me. What is the cost
of acquiring you?
I, King Dhananand can give you
anything you want.
Thank you for your proposition,
Your Highness.
But not everything
in this world can be bought.
For example,
loyalty towards one's master.
My loyalties are infallible.
Thank you
for your proposition.
But not everything
in this world can be bought.
For example,
loyalty towards one's master.
My loyalties are infallible.
So, even if you somehow
make me subservient to you
I can become
a danger to you.
Danger..
Now, I know
how I have to avert
this danger very well.
A wedding is about
to take place in the palace
and all of you
are wearing old clothes!
Go! Hurry up and get new clothes
for yourselves.
Soldier.
I am sorry,
but I am not a soldier.
I am a commander.
Whatever you are,
you are not the king, are you?
This is a list of things
needed for the princess' room.
A grand chandelier made
of 88 pieces of stained glass.
A velvety carpet. And..
- Wait a minute. Have patience.
Who are you to order me?
I do not follow
a mere handmaid's orders.
How dare you
talk to me like that!
You do not know who I am.
I am a friend
of the Princess of Magadha.
I am Shipra.
'Shipra?'
What are you thinking?
Listen to me carefully.
The carpet has to be rosy.
Did you get it?
Has your attachment towards
the carpets not diminished?
What?
I mean that the weight
of the carpets
is immense.
When you pick them up
it seems as if you
are lifting a human.
Why?
Have you ever lifted anyone
when that person
was wrapped in a carpet?
What? I was..
- By the way, it does not seem
that you have ever lifted
even a handkerchief
let alone a carpet.
Now, take this list
and arrange for all
the things written in it.
Hurry up.
I have to decorate
the princess' room
before she returns
from the hermitage.
Did you get it?
'I have to decorate
the princess' room'
'before she returns
from the hermitage.'
'Did you get it?'
Wait a minute.
From the hermitage?
Durdhara has gone
to visit the hermitage!
Lady Mura's hermitage.
I have to reach there
before she does.
Why is Durjan Singh
running away in haste?
There is something fishy.
Excuse me.
I have heard that there
is a scholarly woman here
who trains all the children.
Where is she?
No one knows when she
comes or leaves.
'Mura, I wonder
why I am feeling'
'that you are the
scholarly woman.'
'But where are you?'
'I am sure
that she is here to meet me.'
'Before she sees me,
I have to leave.'
My Lady..
Did you see
the scholarly woman?
Where did she go?
Thank you.
'If Durdhara sees
Lady Mura at the hermitage'
'it will be disastrous.'
Oh, God! She has brought
Ambikumar along.
What is Durdhara thinking?
What does she want?
I have to get
Lady Mura out immediately.
'I have to secure
the backdoor'
'so that no one can use it.'
Mura.
'What is happening here?
I have to find out.'
'This door is closed.
How shall I escape from here?'
Soldier!
Climb down quickly!
Come with me.
It was difficult
to find you.
But I am happy
to have found you
Queen Mura.
I know you are here
to get me imprisoned.
Will you take me
to your dear brother?
Where is it?
Where is your army?
I am ready to fight.
Call them. Let me see
if you are able to take me
to Dhananand or not.
You are misunderstanding me.
Please come with me.
Only once..
I am not going
to be beguiled by you
Princess Durdhara.
Okay fine cut my throt. Kill me.
There is no one here.
Nonone will come to know. Kill me.
Please listen to me once.
I request you.
Just once.
Why were you trying
to scale that wall, soldier?
Answer me.
Training!
I was training, Prince.
I agree that Taxila
and Magadha have become allies.
You are going to marry
Princess Durdhara.
But a soldier should
always be healthy and active.
He should
always be ready for a battle.
That is why
I was training.
Actually, I start training wherever
I am standing, Prince.
For example,
I saw that wall
and thought of exercising.
Prince, I think
even you should exercise.
It makes the muscles
and arms strong.
Do not talk
about useless things.
You can train later.
First, go
and find my fiancee.
She was here
a few moments ago.
I wonder
where she went.
Did you not understand?
Go and find her.
All right, Prince.
Prince, if you do not mind,
can I ask you a question?
Do you really want
to marry Princess Durdhara?
I meant to say that
how can she be a great wife
when she has
left you alone now?
Think about it, Prince.
When she has left
you alone before the wedding
then what will she do
after the wedding?
Think about it, Prince.
Just follow my orders.
Did you get it?
Go and find her.
As you say, Prince.
You cannot appreciate
what you do not have.
I wonder where you
have gone, Princess Durdhara.
Why are you taking
so much time?
I know
that this world
has not seen a villain
as cruel and evil
as my brother.
And I am his sister.
It is more difficult
to trust me.
Especially, when I have
always sided with him.
But time changes.
People change, Queen Mura.
Your son, Chandragupta,
has sowed the seed of change
in my heart.
Five years ago,
when he had captivated me
he made me aware
of the truth of the king
that I never knew.
'Do you think
that your father'
'died in your
dear brother's arms?'
'No!'
'The truth is that
your brother had strangled'
'your father, King
Mahapadmanand, to death.'
'Dhananand had
strangled him with his arms'
'until he died.'
He told me repeatedly
but I never believed him.
I was blind because of the love
I had for my brother.
'Remember this, Durdhara.'
'When you find out
about your father's death'
'you will find out
about my truth.'
'Then you will understand'
'why I am trying
to save my motherland'
'from the hands of a cruel man
like your brother.'
Soon, I understood
that whatever
he had told me
was the truth.
The image of my brother
that he painted before me
was his true form.
Until I believed all this
it was too late.
From that day until now
I have been living
in the guilt
of not trusting Chandragupta.
It has been
killing me little by little
that because
of my brother and me
Chandragupta
and all of you
had to bear
torture and pain.
In the last five years,
there has not been a moment
when I was
not feeling guilty.
To never forget
that I betrayed Chandragupta
and loved
my brother blindly
I have kept
Chandragupta's memories alive
in Magadha
as a form of penance.
'Forgive me, Your Highness.
I forgot to tell you something.'
'I am getting
the 'Hawamahal' reconstructed.'
'These are the things
needed for the same.'
'I want you to appoint the
greatest artisans of Magadha'
'to create a flag
similar to this one.'
'You are just a king for me.'
'You are no longer
my brother.'
In these five years
I have asked God
for only one opportunity.
The opportunity
to apologise to Chandragupta.
I just want
to meet him once
and apologise.
I want to rectify
my mistakes.
I thought that I would
never get this opportunity.
But when I saw you
the other day
I came to believe
that God has given me
this opportunity again.
Believe me.
If you ask me
I will never meet you again.
Please give me a chance.
Let me meet
Chandragupta once.
I want to face him
and relieve the burden
of my guilt.
I want to tell him
that he was right
and I was wrong.
Let me meet Chandragupta.
Queen Mura, tell me
where Chandragupta is.
Chandragupta is dead.
What!
- Yes.
Chandra is no more.
I saw him die.
Stulbhadra,
Chandragupta is not dead.
He is alive.
My heart says
that he is alive.
The promise that he had
made five years ago..
He will definitely fulfil it.
My son will come back to me.
I had set out to find the one
who had attacked Dhananand.
Now, I am looking for that
arrogant and proud Durdhara.
Lady Mura's belief
that her son will come back
is unshakeable.
But the truth..
I saw what the truth is.
I saw Chandra
and Acharya Chanakya's
dead bodies.
What did you see, Stulbhadra?
Tell me everything.
What had happened
five years ago?
After listening to you,
I support Queen Mura's belief.
Chandragupta is alive.
What?
- Yes, Stulbhadra.
Think about it.
If they had died
why would have
their dead bodies been carried
far from the Taxila
palace and out of the city?
There is a cemetery
inside the city.
I am sure that you know
the incomplete truth.
Princess, you are uselessly
giving Lady Mura hope again.
My hope never died, Stulbhadra.
In the last five years,
I never thought
that my son, Chandragupta,
has died.
I think that Ambikumar would know
something about it.
I will find out from him
about what had happened
to Acharya Chanakya
and Chandragupta on that day.
If I simply throw
this stone into the water
it will sink
due to its weight.
But if I throw it
into the water
after calculating
the speed, direction and angle
then this stone
can bounce on the water.
A human's
deeds and plans
have the
same relationship.
A pre-planned scheme
can give you
the desired results.
That is why do remember
that if you want great results
then there
should be a balance
between your
deeds and plans.
My ethics..
Your destiny.
Whosoever attacks me the one with whom
my sister is hatching a conspiracy
burn her in her hermitage.

================================================================================

Episode: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cx1QjMzXInw

I never lost hope, Stulbhadra.
Even for a second,
in last five years I never thought
that my son Chandragupta is dead.
You..
What are you doing here?
I.. I can ask the same question,
Princess.
What are you doing here?
I think, I don't need
your permission to go anywhere.
Did you understand, soldier?
Princess, did you mean you prefer
this ordinary house
over the magnificent
palace and all the services?
You see, there is no grandeur here
nor an royal facilities
for someone like you.
So what was the purpose..
Stay in your limits..
Don't forget your place.
I'm a princess.
And you are mere a soldier.
Did you get it?
Take your hands of me, Princess.
- Or else..
- Or else, what?
I m glad that you listened to me.
It seems like
you are a brat.
But not a fool.
In fact, you are much intelligent
than that stupid Ambikumar.
How dare you!
How dare you speak ill of
my future husband and your prince?
Oh! Forgive me, Princess.
Please forgive me for insulting him.
What can I say?
I think, the prince that
needs someone else's help
in his own kingdom,
to look for his own princess
has no respect.
You know what?
I think you should join
the people in this monastery.
Maybe, you will learn some
manners with children here.
Manners..
Princess,
please don't worry about my manners.
The day when you will
become princess of this kingdom
we all will bow our heads to you.
If you are done
entertaining yourself here
can we please leave?
Your stupid..
I mean
your future husband
is waiting for you.
And I have better things to do
other than searching a runaway bride.
Shall we go, Princess?
'I must deviate his
attention to save ma'am.'
Stulbhadra!
What's going on here?
Why is he running away?
'To save me, Stulbhadra distracted
that soldier's attention.'
'I will protect Stulbhadra.'
No word from Durdhara or that soldier.
God knows, where did they go to?
- Maybe..
- Ambikumar..
Princess!
Princess, where did you go?
I have been waiting for you.
And I was worried as well.
In fact,
I did send a soldier behind you.
Yes. I have met him.
This is not fair, Princess.
I am being your tour guide
and you take off without tell me.
You tell me, is this fair?
Please forgive me, Prince.
I thought,
to impress you by surprising you.
This is why I went away
from you for some time.
Oh, God. You are not just good.
You are the best, Durdhara.
That I am.
Probably, this why my
life partner is also special.
Shall we go?
There is definitely a connection
between princess and this monastery.
I must inform King Dhanand at once.
Enough with the hide and seek game!
Tell me now..
Who attacked Dhanand?
And I believe that
you know everything.
Tell me!
Answer me!
Speak!
Tell me..
I will tell you everything.
But first let me go.
Tell me..
Thank you for letting go off me.
But the fact is,
I am still a trusted
soldier of Takshashila.
And I am still loyal towards the army.
What do I do? Stubhadra might get hit.
Fatso, it is time
to tell the truth now.
Do not test my patience. Tell me.
If you are strong and brave
I am not weak either.
I have found the perfect aim.
'What is happening to me?'
'Why is my heart not allowing me
to shoot this soldier and harm him?'
Hey, leave me.
Now, you will be held captive
till you answer all my questions.
Understood?
Come.
'Om.'
Your Majesty.
'Om'.
Control yourself.
Your Majesty, be careful.
Do you know the advantage
of performing these
different styles of yoga?
No, Your Majesty.
I want to tell you
that I cannot do this.
In fact, none of my family members
are interested in yoga
because this is not in our blood.
Neither me nor Durdhara.
Why did she go to
the yoga hermitage then?
She would not have gone to learn yoga.
This means..
Yes.
Amatya, she had gone
to meet the person
who had attacked me.
The one whom Durdhara had helped.
Your Majesty, if you are sure about it
why are you delaying?
Give me an order.
I will bring every member
of that hermitage in front of you.
As far as your attacker is concerned
I will chop his head
and place it at your feet.
Head?
No.
No, Amatya.
This is Takshashila and not Magadh.
And this hermitage is located in
the prestigious place of Takshashila.
We will have to find
some other option.
What is your suggestion, Your Majesty?
The person who had attacked me
and with whom my sister
is plotting against me
should be burnt along
with the hermitage.
Burn the hermitage, Amatya.
Your wish is my command, Your Majesty.
I am opening your hands.
But use your hands only to eat.
If you try to do anything against me
or try to run away from here
you will not get food,
but you will be slapped by me.
Did you understand?
And till you tell me the address
of the person who attacked Dhananand
you will not find a way out from here.
Do you get it?
And why were you saving that attacker?
My mouth will also
open just to have food
and not to answer your questions.
What is this?
Only so many Rotis?
This will not be sufficient for me.
Could you not bring more?
Do you always do this?
What do I always do?
No.
The matter is..
Did you see that?
Your plan has failed now.
Look at that.
My soldiers have arrived.
They have reached
here in search of me.
Calm down.
They are not your soldiers
but my dear ones.
But how do you know?
Just wait and watch.
First, that person
will knock the door twice.
Then he will knock the
door one by one two times.
Did I not tell you?
He alone is so strong.
What if one more person arrives?
I think this will be
the last Roti of my life.
Acharya Chanakya.
Stulbhadra!
Stulbhadra!
C-Chandra!
Your character should not be defined
by any mistake or error made in life.
We should neither let our
mistake or guilt takeover us.
Anybody can make a mistake.
So, we should accept
our mistake as a lesson
and learn from it
and proceed towards success n life.
My ethics..
Your destiny.
Durdhara is also there in the hermitage
- where queen Mura is residing?
- Yes, Acharya.
But Dhananand would have
definitely sent some spies
behind his sister
to keep a watch on her!
You mean, mother..
Mother is in danger?

================================================================================

Episode: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4X6NZONLeG0

C-Chandra!
'Hey!'
Stul!
Even after so many years
you're still.. You're still the same.
You still look like
the one who's fond of food.
You haven't changed at all, you hefty.
Nor you have, Chandra.
You still don't let me
eat more rotis, friend.
Why did I stop?
What invisible power stopped..
Stopped my hand?
That soldier..
That soldier is a threat to me.
He's hovering around
Stul like a threat but still..
I couldn't attack him yet. Why!
Saint..
Can you tell us the story
of the prince of Piplivan?
We want to hear the story once
again before going to bed tonight.
Come.
This took place long ago.
There was a beautiful and
a prosperous kingdom called Piplivan.
The prince over there..
The prince over there
was not just a brave warrior
but he was also kind
and sensitive.
Whenever innocent
people were in trouble
Piplivan's prince would save everyone.
No matter how challenging it was
he would face all the challenges
by standing adamant like a mountain.
No matter who you are
and no matter what reason you
attacked the emperor Dhananand for
both you and your motive
will come to an end, today.
You will be burnt into ashes
along with this hermitage.
Make it fast.
Amatya Rakshas!
We do not have much time.
Oh, Lord!
Amatya Rakshas is setting
the hermitage on fire.
That means, the one who attacked
Dhananand is none other than
my mother?
A-Acharya!
That means
she is my mother?
That's why,
you were trying to save her, isn't it?
Yes, Chandra.
How could I break my promise to you?
'Don't worry, Chandra.'
'I will stay with your mother
till you and Acharya return.'
'I won't go anywhere
leaving her alone, Chandra.'
But
what was the snob,
Durdhara doing in the hermitage?
Durdhara?
Did Durdhara go to the hermitage
where queen Mura is residing?
Yes, Acharya.
But there's nothing to worry..
This is definitely something
to be worried about, Stulbhadra!
I'm not sure about Durdhara.
But Dhananand would have
definitely sent some spies
behind his sister
to keep a watch on her!
You mean..
You mean, mother..
Mother is in danger?
Get up.. Get up..
Get up.. Get up..
Don't make any noise, all right?
Just do as I say.
Are you getting me?
Don't make any noise.
Let's go.. Let's go.
You are finished.
Let's go.
We are done with our work.
Let's go.
'I must soon find
a way to help them all.'
Come here at once!
Do not look back till
you reach somewhere safe.
Do not stop! Keep running!
'What had happened to
Chandragupta and Chanakya'
'five years ago when
they went to see Seleucus!'
'I must ask Ambhikumar at once.'
What are you thinking, Durdhara?
I was simply thinking of my brother.
I am so happy
that he has agreed to have
us married and for this alliance.
But you do not know his rage!
None of his enemies survive for long!
Do you remember that Chandragupta?
Just to kill that one Chandragupta
my brother burned the entire palace!
There is no one else like my brother!
He never spares his enemies.
He only stops when
his enemies are dead.
What is the matter?
Do you wish to tell me something?
It is a secret.
If you give me your word
that you will tell no one
then I might tell you of that secret.
A secret, you say?
About Chandragupta!
He did not die in the fire
that was set by your brother.
My father killed that Chandragupta!
What?
It is true.
It is true.
Chandragupta survived the fire.
He did come here with his Acharya
Chanakya all the way to Takshashila.
To meet Seleucus and seek
his help to fight your brother again.
And to get Dhananand
out of the throne of Magadh.
But when my father..
When my father exposed their lie..
'After befriending both of you'
'Ambhiraj made me
aware of your truth.'
Then King Seleucus'
wrath rained upon them
And he beat them to
an inch of their death.
And then..
What next?
What happened?
Chanakya and Chandragupta
were thrown in a deep pit.
A pit so deep from
where none have returned.
A pain that rivals hell on earth.
A torment that makes
life worse than death.
'Chandragupta, I will find you,
once I know where that pit is.'
Your son has returned
to uphold his word, Mother!
Mother!
Chandra!
'Mother, I do not wish to go!
I do not want to go!'
Mother!
Chandra!
'Do not worry, Mother.
Nothing will happen to me.'
Mother.
I lost you once.
Then, I found you.
I lost you twice.
But now..
I cannot lose you again, Mother.
I have returned.
Mother.
Come with me.
Mother. There is just
one way to escape from here.
We need to jump from that huge wall.
Mother.
Will you be able to cross this hurdle?
I can cross any hurdle
if my son is with me.
Wait!
He is not who you think he is.
Do not stop her.
She knows who I am.
She is hitting me because I stayed
away from her for five years.
I will have to be
punished for what I did.
M-Mother, I have spent my childhood
wishing for this.
Hit me, Mother.
Hit me.
Hit me more..
Every attack of yours
will erase every pain
I've suffered in the
past five years living alone.
Mother..
Your slaps are giving me relief.
Hit me, Mother. Hit me.
If I take this unripe fruit
keep it in an unnatural and
derivative environment and hope
that it will ripe into
a sweet and healthy fruit
will it be possible?
No.
That is why, I must let
it stay on this tree
so that it ripes
in a natural environment
and becomes sweet and healthy.
Similarly,
even if you have a good strategy
but if you do not have
the appropriate environment
or time to work on it,
no matter how great the strategy is,
you will never get the desired result.
Do not forget,
to get the desired results
you need the balance of the right plan
environment and time.
My ethics..
Your destiny.
I will not ask you that who
that person is whom you are saving.
I do not want to hide
anything from you.
In fact, I want to tell you his name.
- Then tell me.
- Chandragupta Maurya..

================================================================================

Episode: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Do0-1Z1sJU

I knew that you would
definitely return.
I-I knew that you were
somewhere around me.
I-I had the intuition
of your presence.
Your Majesty Mura.
You have set an excellent example
of the bravery and
courage of a warrior.
Please accept my greetings.
Undoubtedly
it is because of your faith
that I and Chandragupta
could successfully
come out of that dark cave.
But now, it is not the time
to get carried away by emotions.
The soldiers must be coming.
We will have to get out of here soon.
Yes. Let us go!
Just a moment.
I first want to find out
that who ignited this fire.
Amatya Rakshas.
Amatya Rakshas ignited the fire.
I witnessed this myself.
No, Mother.
I am very sure that this
is not done by Amatya alone.
He must have been sent by Durdhara.
I am completely sure
that mine and Chandragupta's mother's
belief will come out to be true.
Tonight, I myself will
go to Mura and tell her
that her son, Chandragupta is alive.
A fire is ignited in the hermitage.
Go and inform the king of Takshashila,
Ambhiraj quickly. Go.
Mura!
Leave me!
- Let me go!
- No, Princess.
It is hot in there and it is not safe.
Leave me!
I want to go inside! Let me go!
Why?
Who is there inside
whom you want to save?
No, Chandra.
I do not think that
Durdhara is involved
in burning the hermitage
and trying to kill me.
This time, I saw something in her eyes
which I never saw before.
This time,
her eyes had remorse and repentance.
She was in sorrow and atonement
because of the cruelty on us.
That is why,
I feel that she cannot even think
of giving us a fresh wound.
Mother, do you remember
her brother, Dhananand ignited
fire in the palace to kill us?
And who gave him the
information that we were there?
The same Durdhara did.
I will never be able
to trust her, Mother
no matter how much she
shows remorse and repentance.
I am sorry, Your Majesty.
But even I agree with
Chandra in this matter.
Those siblings do not
deserve to be trusted.
Am I right?
What happened?
An opportunity
is inherent in every situation.
What is required is just
to find that opportunity
and to utilise it.
Even the fire in the hermitage
can come out to be
an opportunity for us.
What are you thinking about?
I have a plan.
But for this plan to succeed
the role of a special character
will be very important.
Do you mean
this character is Durdhara?
Excellent, Chandragupta.
That is why you are so dear to me.
I just say a word
and you understand the complete story.
Undoubtedly
Princess Durdhara will
be that special character
of our plan.
That is why you will have
to go and bring her to me here.
- But..
- This is my order.
I agree
that you have become expert
in hiding things from me.
But a king should know many things
such as who planned
a conspiracy against me.
Everyone is a suspect
in a king's vision
no matter whether she
is his own dear sister.
Who else knows your
brother better than you?
I will definitely catch the
planner of the conspiracy very soon
whom I can just smell as of now.
By the way
I will not ask you that who
that person is whom you are saving.
Because I know that
you will not answer me
even if I ask.
Right?
No. You got it wrong, Your Highness.
I do not want to hide
anything from you.
In fact, I want to tell you his name.
Really? Then tell me.
Let me also know
that who he is
who targeted me.
His name is Chandragupta Maurya.
Chandragupta Maurya.
Chandragupta Maurya..
Chandragupta Maurya..
I have burned him and his
friends to ashes five years ago.
Do you remember that?
Yes, I do!
But killing Chandragupta
does not mean you have
erased his philosophy, Your Majesty.
His philosophy still exists
in the heart of everyone
in India everyone opposing you.
You burned down an ashram
to kill your assailant.
But you just wait and watch.
Someone will take
an ember from the ashes
and light the fire of rebellion!
Hear this and understand it.
I will burn down everyone
to rebel against me
just like I burned down
Chandragupta five years ago.
Do you get it?
Excuse me, Your Majesty.
Ambhiraj and Seleucus have
called for an emergency meeting.
And you presence
is important for that.
I cannot attend any
meeting right now, Amatya.
They want to talk to you
about the fire in the ashram.
You want me to bring Durdhara here.
But you know that
I do not trust her at all.
- And..
- But you trust me, right?
Do you or do you not?
- I trust you.
- That is it.
If you trust me
go and bring Princess Durdhara to me.
Well, Chandragupta, can you do that?
Can you or can you not?
- Yes.
- That is good.
The matter is closed.
Go and bring Princess Durdhara
to me safely and immediately.
Chandra..
I have been away
from you for five years.
So I deserve to spend
some time with you, right?
There is something more, Chandra.
Even if you do not form
friendship with Durdhara
you should be respectful
and honourable towards her.
I will try..
I will definitely try..
Come on, fat boy.
Call me with respect!
Look at him, Mura.. Hey, Chandra!
What is your plan, Acharya?
It is simple, Your Majesty.
We have to make sure
to use the fire at the ashram
to burn down the alliance
between Seleucus and Dhananand.
Why are you worried now, Your Majesty?
It is because the things Durdhara
said were more horrifying
than the fire you set.
Why did Durdhara remember him after
so many years here in Takshashila!
Is Chandragupta really alive?
Where is this story heading towards?
I am doing this only
because Chanakya told me to.
Or else I do not even want
to look at that arrogant Durdhara.
Listen to me carefully!
I am going to get Princess Durdhara.
Quickly make that place so beautiful
that it brings a smile to her face.
Do you know what you have to do?
Quickly!
No, I do not want to go anywhere!
Give me a chance to please you.
I am your future husband.
Who else would you
tell about your concerns
if not me?
'Do as he says.
Go where he tells you to.'
'You will get answers
to your questions.'
'Who has send this message for me?
And why?'
Princess Durdhara must
have gotten my message by now.
Take it away..
Durjan, you are well aware
of Prince Ambikumar's wrath.
He will definitely
fire us from this job!
I have helped you
financially for years now.
I will take care of
it in the future as well.
Now do as I said!
- Go!
- Okay.
You take so much care of me.
And I.. I am breaking your heart
by going against
a simple wish of yours.
Will you.. Will you come with me?
Of course. I will accompany you.
Good.
- Let us go.
- Okay.
Who knows what is going
on in the mind of Acharya.
I did not even start my task and he..
I am seething in anger
thinking about this princess.
How dare you do this!
Can you see and walk?
Forgive me, Your Highness.
- Forgive me.
- Keep quiet.
I very well know how
to punish those hands
which do not know
how to work properly.
Please stop!
Ambikumar, a bad odour
is coming out of your body.
Go quickly and change your dress.
Sure.
Sorry for the inconvenience.
Go. The door outside..
40 steps from it..
On the left, you will get my gift.
I'll quickly change
my dress and come back.
Are you okay? Stop crying.
Take these.
As soon as possible leave this palace
or else the prince will punish you.
- Go.
- I am obliged, Princess.
After all, who is waiting for me
at the designated place of Ambikumar.
You..
Accept my apologies, Princess.
Maybe you were thinking
of someone else.
Stop your nonsense!
Leave.
Forgive me
but I am outside the palace.
So I am not bound to obey you.
Look. Somebody sent
a message for me to come here.
That is the reason, I am here.
But I think I have
to leave this place now.
You have to come with me.
How dare you touch me!
Leave me!
I almost forgot
that you were going to get married.
Then only Ambikumar
has the right to touch you.
Okay. I have let go of your hand.
Shall we go now?
If you think you can kidnap me
then you are making a grave mistake.
Never challenge me.
I can do anything if I want to.
By the way
I am used to kidnapping.
Do not try to be brave!
Why are you in a hurry, Princess?
Have you not gained pleasure
by burning down a hermitage?
Is there any other
place left to be burnt?
What! What did you say?
I know everything about you.
I know that hermitage is not the
first place to be burnt down by you.
Five years ago, you and your brother
had burnt down a lot of things..
A lot of expectations..
A lot of dreams..
And the trust of your friend.
'Do you think I am a foolish princess'
'to be impressed by your words'
'and stay captive in your place?'
'To deceive all of you,
I had made this plan.'
'My brother will come
here and kill all of you.'
Who are you?
You all definitely know
the qualities of the sunflower.
To give a meaning to its name
it always faces towards the Sun.
As the Sun moves in the sky
these sunflowers also faces
towards the it.
Relationships are somewhat like this
which, in every situation
and in every place goes together.
If you want to bloom
like the sunflower
then try to connect with those people
who will stand by you
in every given situation.
If you do this,
you will see it yourself
the way the sunflower
trusts the light of the sun
the same way, you will also prosper.
My ethics..
Your destiny.
Is it really you? I cannot believe it.
Let go of me!
Your lies will not work on me.
Durdhara..
I don't trust you anymore.

================================================================================

Episode: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKcGpCgeUZk

Who are you?
At this time,
it doesn't matter who am I?
The important thing
is to take you with me
to someone who is waiting for you.
Until you tell me who you are
I won't leave from here.
I knew it.
It will comes down to this..
Hence I was prepared..
Let go of my hand.
If you take another step forward
I will hurt you.
Listen to me.. I'll do it..
Let me go..
Stop or you will die.
Do as you please.
This is not the first time
when people had tried to kill me.
I have defeated death all the time
and hence I am still standing here.
'I have heard,
challenges get you excited.'
'If that is true then you
have to bring me that flower.'
'I will get you that flower.'
I know only one person
who can defeat death.
Chandra..
Well done, Princess.
My men informed me
that your men were here.
Amatya Rakshas and his people entered
my lands and burned a monastery.
I am here, attending your
sister's pre-wedding rituals
and he busy destroying my lands.
Ambhiraj,
do you have to add anything to it?
This monastery is one of
the prominent places in our kingdom.
I would love to know
why did you do this?
Yes. I gave the orders
to burn down the monastery.
But that was not
supposed to be destroyed.
It was done to protect your respect.
You both know, for the last five years
rebellions have
terrorised Takshashila.
And when I came to know
from my trusted informers
that the monastery was
providing shelter to the rebels
I decided to burn down that place.
And I had to be quick about it.
Because if I would have send my troops
to destroy that place
you would have done the same.
It would have become a big deal
and news would have spread
and you two would
have faced embarrassment
in front of your own subjects
when your people
would have come to know
that the rebels are
thriving under your noses.
The monastery that you
both claimed to be prominent
the same monastery
was trying to ruin your reigns.
That is why
I made it look like an accident.
This way, enemies got destroyed
and your reputations were safe.
You are right..
King only did us a favour.
I am quite pleased
by your intelligence, Ambhiraj.
I like the change in your view.
Seleucus, whatever I did
was to make our alliance
strong and not weaker.
Your problems are my problems now.
Tell me..
Do you think,
I am at fault here or are you
grateful to me?
Absolutely, I am very grateful to you.
We were wrong to
doubt your intentions.
We made a mistake.
A big mistake..
All the misunderstandings
have been cleared now.
I must leave now..
Is it really you?
I cannot believe it.
Oh! What have I done?
You have no idea, Chandra.
I have been looking
for you for so long.
I have been hopefully waiting for you.
How can I not see that it was you.
Let go of me!
At least,
hear my side of the story, Chandra.
I do not want to hear anything.
Your lies will not work on me.
Durdhara..
I do not repeat
same mistakes.
I don't trust you anymore.
If you don't trust me
then why are you here?
Because there is someone
out there who I can trust.
And it was his order
that brought me here
to bring you back to him.
Okay then.
Lets go..
Tell me, where are we going?
Princess Durdhara, it is my nature
that I do not trust anyone so easily.
But I am trusting you.
Usually, Chandragupta
trusts people very easily.
But he is not able
to trust you so easily.
He might trust you later.
I will ask you a question.
And your answer
will decide whether
you can be trusted or not.
Tell us.
Will you join us in our revolution
against your powerful
and ruthless brother?
Will you go against your brother?
Yes, I will support you.
No, Acharya. We cannot trust her.
She betrayed us earlier too.
Only time will tell whether
she can be trusted or not.
But now,
you should understand one thing
that you and Princess Durdhara
will play important roles
in our next move.
Both of you need to work together.
Acharya, I assure you.
I will keep my words.
I have realised that
I used to support a sinner.
Now, I want to support
those people who are noble souls.
And for that, I need to reduce
my brother's strength first.
In fact, I have already started it.
How?
I have told Dhananand that
the person who attacked him
is none other than Chandragupta.
Even he reacted the same manner
as you are reacting now.
I have told Dhananand
that it is Chandragupta's ideology
which has reached Takshashila.
And his ideology has given
birth to many revolutionists.
Hence, he should not
consider Chandragupta dead.
His ideology is still alive
in the freedom struggle
and in the hearts of the people.
He is still alive.
Did you hear her, Chandra?
What else proof do
you need to trust her?
She has changed.
Your Highness,
whatever she told Dhananand
maybe her intention was good.
But it can be proved fatal for us.
- What?
- Yes, Princess.
We should not instigate a snake,
a sleeping monster
and an insecure emperor
by reminding him about his enemy.
Your words about Chandragupta
must have shaken
Dhananand to the core.
He must be in a dilemma
whether Chandragupta was
burned alive in the fire incident
that took place in Hawa Mahal
or he escaped unhurt.
And he will definitely try to confirm
that Chandragupta is dead at any cost.
On the auspicious occasion of the
marriage between my son and your sister
I will find a match for you as well.
Your Highness, there is no scarcity
of beautiful girls in Takshashila.
I will present beautiful girls
before you one after another.
I agree that there is
no scarcity of beautiful girls
in Takshashila.
Thank you.
But my goal..
My goal is so big
that there is no place
for a wife in my life now.
Your Highness, you have
achieved everything in your life.
What else is left to achieve?
You are the greatest emperor of India.
What else is left to achieve?
I do not understand
the concept of India.
Magadh is the most important to me.
And I want to make Magadh the best
and the most powerful
kingdom of this world.
This is the only goal of my life.
Emperor Seleucus will not
like after learning about this.
Ambhiraj!
But we are relatives now.
It is not necessary
that Seleucus learns
about our conversation.
If you think that I will
betray Emperor Seleucus
then it is impossible.
Remember one thing.
It will never happen.
Ambhiraj, you have taken
my words seriously.
I was just kidding.
Ambhiraj.. Please sit down.
Ambhiraj, please sit down.
You took away the
intoxication of the liquor
by taking what I said seriously.
You ruined my happiness!
Your Majesty, I did not understand
your humour and took it seriously.
It was a mistake.
Tell me, what do I have
to do to please you
to make everything right,
to calm your mind again?
Your Majesty, tell me!
What do you want?
Ambhiraj
I am Magadh King, Emperor Dhananand.
I have everything.
If you do want to give me a gift
make it something like
I gave you five years ago
by killing your worst enemy, Chanakya.
I do have something special
only for you.
What is it?
I can take you to tomb
of your greatest enemy.
Chandragupta?
Yes and Chanakya too.
His tomb is also here, in Takshashila.
There you go!
Look what your words have done,
Your Highness.
We are trusting her, Acharya.
Thank you very much for
your assistance, Your Highness
but you have created problems
for us all even before
getting involved with the plan.
You stop it!
No matter what I do
you have already decided
that I am not a good person.
The truth is that I do not
want to prove anything to you.
I want to prove to myself.
I want to make myself
good enough in my own opinion.
- No, Your Highness..
- Chandragupta..
Your Highness,
you first have to make sure to drive
away Dhananand's suspicion
that Chandragupta is alive.
Or else his suspicions
could ruin all our plans.
Do not worry, Acharya.
I will be with her all the time.
I do not trust her at all.
She might ruin things
instead of handling them.
So I will keep an eye
on her all the time.
Your Highness, shall we go
and clean the mess you have created?
God knows what Dhananand will do next.
Until he finds out that
Chandragupta is really dead
he will not rest in peace.
So this is what happened
in Takshashila five years ago.
You threw Chandragupta and
Chanakya inside a horrifying hole
which no one can escape.
You are right.
When I think about that hole,
I still get chills
by thinking how they
would have died slowly
and painfully inside
the darkness of the hole.
Thank you, Ambhiraj!
You really are
a true relative!
You were right.
I love this gift!
Now you will take me
to that hold in which
you threw Chandragupta.
Of course, I will.
I will take you to the hole.
That hole only has a way
to go in but there is no way out.
Rotten corpses of those
two must still be inside the hole.
I will take you there
tomorrow morning.
Tomorrow morning?
No, Ambhiraj.
I am not so patient.
I want my gift now.
Now?
Can you forget what
happened in the past?
No!
My present has been determined
by things that happened
in the past.
My future will also be determined
by my past.
I have learned from my past
that people are not what they seem.
So one should not
trust what is visible.
Learn another lesson,
Prince of Piplivan.
Past is like mud.
We can either get stuck in it
or we can get out
of it and go forward.
- Take this.
- Let it be.
I do not need your help.
Such arrogance will
not be good for our plan.
Take it.
Look, we are here
on an important mission.
We should not be late.
Anyway, your teacher said
that we have to work together.
Take it.
Pumpkin!
What?
You called me a 'pumpkin'!
How dare you!
No, not you. Get up.
But, why do you need a pumpkin?
It has to do with love.
You will not understand.
Someone has rightly said
that, 'even time cannot
change some people'.
She is as crazy as
she was five years ago.
Princess,
where did you go so late at night?
I sent soldiers to look for you.
What kind of a prince
depends on others
to search for his lover?
I wonder
does he wash his hands
by himself after eating
or does he need servants
for that as well?
- Princess.
- My beloved prince.
I went out to get
something special for you.
But, since I am not
acquainted to this place
I lost my way.
And you can see
a soldier of yours came
as a guardian angel and helped me
in getting back to you.
Arya, you have never
fallen short in my service.
And you are ever ready
to protect my loved ones.
But, princess,
where did you go this late at night?
To bring you a gift.
A gift! What is it?
- A pumpkin?
- It is really good for your health.
Eating it will help
you remain healthy for life.
Your life is very important to me.
Eating this will keep sickness at bay
and strengthen your immune system.
Not only that eating this
will ensure good eye sight for life.
That will make sure
that you can look
and soak in my beauty
and forever be in love with me.
Wow!
This is a very special gift.
And it is true love as well.
Do you agree, Arya?
Yes, my prince. This is true love.
I have never seen such love.
Princess.
If you cook this for me,
I will be very happy.
Of course, my prince.
But first, I have to meet my brother.
Sure.
But remember,
I will be waiting for you.
And I am a little impatience
so please, return soon.
Okay.
Great.
Let's go. Time to look for my brother.
He.. He really said that?
Yes. And as a result
he did not live for long.
Oh! My lovely sister is here.
Looks like you drank
a little too much tonight.
Yes, Durdhara.
We were celebrating the fact
that you are marrying the prince.
And look, your in-law
have gifted me
something I have never received.
What is that gift?
Keep your curiosity alive, Durdhara.
And without any delay
come with me.
I have something to show you.
Come.
Arya!
Brave and mighty, Arya!
You too, come with us.
No, sir. I am perfectly fine here.
Soldier!
You dare refuse him!
You are refusing my son's in-law!
You dare to refuse
'India's' greatest king?
How dare you!
No, my Lord. The thing is..
Then come.
Let us go.
Durdhara,
can you tell where we are going?
Try to guess. Think.
- We are going..
- Quiet.
No, sir.
I want my sister to
think and give an answer.
Come on, think.
Right.
You cannot think of anything.
Very well. I will help you.
We are going to watch someone's death.
Someone I am very excited
to see come to an end.
- Who's end?
- Chandragupta.
He is already dead, right?
Burnt in the palace fire.
I thought so too.
But he did not die. He lived.
He did not burn in that fire.
He has just few days to live.
I am taking you all to his final
destination where he allegedly died.
'If Dhananand learns
that I and Acharya lived'
'our entire plan will be in jeopardy.'
A pearl, on its own
is special and expensive.
But
when you put together the
pearls it becomes a garland.
Which is much special and expensive.
This example fits
influential people as well.
When many influential
people get together
it's effect is much greater.
And compared to a single person
it can bring much better
and bigger results.
Remember sometimes,
to bringing about big changes
an influential person
alone is not enough.
What is required is
to bring together other like
minded and influential persons
and only then,
you will achieve your goals.
My ethics..
Your destiny.
Even if Dhananand is
entering that pit today
Chandragupta is way
more familiar with it.
No matter how powerful
a king Dhananand is
it is impossible for him
to defeat Chandragupta in that pit.

================================================================================

Episode: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KKylMmdNGU

Dhananand burned down Hawa Mahal.
He saw us reducing to ashes.
He saw the evidence left by us.
Acharya, why do you think
Dhananand will assume
that Chandragupta is alive?
Sometimes, a mother's foresight
can see something which is not clear.
And sometimes, her affectionate eyes
cannot see something
which is clearly visible.
Queen Mura, you know very well
that Dhananand does
not believe anything easily.
Especially then when his beloved
sister is talking
about his biggest enemy
who supposedly died years ago.
You have overcome every stage
of this difficult journey
with a flying colours.
This is not the time
to show your weakness.
I do understand
that mere thinking
of losing Chandragupta
can be so painful
and dangerous for you
after staying away from him for years.
But Queen Mura,
you have to stay strong.
Do not let your affection
weaken either you or your son.
Use your affection for your
son as a weapon and give it to him.
Make him more powerful.
Being the guru of Chandragupta
I know it very well
that the source of Chandragupta's
strength is his mother.
Lady Mura.
What happened?
Ambiraj is taking Dhananand,
Durdhara and Chandra somewhere.
- Where is he taking them now?
- No idea.
Are you sure that Ambiraj
is taking them somewhere?
Yes, Acharya. I have seen on my own.
I think I know
where he is taking them.
Your Highness.
I have forgotten the past
I do not want to recollect the past
by seeing Chandragupta's corpse again.
I think I should return to the palace.
No.. No, Durdhara.
It is like ruining a beautiful picture
if you return from here without seeing
his corpse despite coming so far away.
And you yourself are an artist.
You know very well
that an incomplete
picture hurts our eyes.
Am I right?
Your Highness.
Sorry to interfere.
But I think you should
not get into this pit
God knows what is
waiting for you inside.
A great emperor like you
should not take this risk.
You want to know
what is inside, right?
Order me.
I will go inside and
give you all the information.
Ambiraj
for the first time
I am seeing concern in his eyes
instead of hatred towards Magadh.
How come you have
changed all of a sudden?
It is surprising.
If Dhananand gets into the pit
he will get to know
that Chandragupta is alive.
And in that case,
he will grow suspicious of Arya.
We have to do something, Acharya.
We have to go there.
Fear leads to defeat.
And struggle leads to victory.
And the current situation is like this
that only Chandragupta
needs to do this struggle.
Arya, I did not come here
so far so late in the night
so that someone else
enjoys the spectacle
which is a treat to my eyes.
I myself will see the corpses
of Chandragupta and Chanakya.
And for that, I do not mind
to get into this pit.
I will definitely go inside the pit.
'I have to solve
this problem on my own.'
'Even Acharya expects this from me.'
How can you even think
that Chandra will solve
this problem on his own?
He is in a deep trouble and you
are busy preparing useless medicines!
I am not wasting my time, Stulbhadra.
This ordinary looking medicine
will create a serious rift
between Ambiraj and
Seleucus in future.
But Acharya, what is the
use of thinking about the future
if we fail to solve
our present problem?
Dhananand is about to get into the pit
to find out the truth
about you and Chandragupta.
Worried about the outcome
of the events of today
I cannot cease my plans for tomorrow.
But Chandra is our future!
He is the future of this great land!
If he ends up dying
then what good will
any of your plans do?
Lady, please talk to him.
complete faith in Chandra
But Dhananand will not
rest easy ill he finds the truth.
Yes, my Queen.
This very urge to find out the truth
will lead Dhananand to
failure and us to success.
Every attempt he makes
in finding out the truth
will bring us close to victory
and stray him away from it.
Such a huge banyan tree
in such a deep barren pit.
It must be the doing of Chanakya.
So Chanakya and Chandragupta
had escaped this pit?
I must determine if
my doubt holds ground.
If that Chandragupta
is still alive!
Listen to me.
We must do something
at once to evade this peril!
Splendid, Princess.
You enjoy finding
a way out of troubles
that you bring forth.
Did you stop painting and
entertain yourself with such acts?
I speak for your well being and you..
The day I have to rely
on you for my well-being
I would gladly jump in an endless pit.
Then so be it. Sit here in ease
and wait for my brother
to reach the truth.
I would have been easily convinced
that you would have been
Chandragupta and Chanakya
but this
thriving tree..
This casts doubt in my heart.
A doubt that you both
are not Chanakya
and Chandragupta. No! Never!
What are you doing here
in this deep barren pit?
Tell me!
Will you not?
You are not so huge
that someone might
climb atop you and leave.
No! It is impossible!
Impossible.
But when I think
of Chanakya and Chandragupta then
they have often defied the impossible.
And I must test this
for myself.
My Lord!
What do you think of my gift?
I hope that you are pleased to see
the remains of Chandragupta
and Chanakya!
Yes, Ambhiraj.
I am so pleased
after seeing this.
I have never ever received
such a gift before.
I know that your brother
is up to something.
He is lying to Ambhiraj, for certain.
I think you must leave.
No matter what happens over here.
You will be the suspect!
My Lord!
Let us have a drink together
to celebrate this gift. Come on up!
- Ambhiraj!
- Yes, my Lord!
The rope I used to descend in here,
is broken.
I need your help to come out.
Do not worry, Dhananand, I..
I will send my best soldier.
Soldier, get a rope.
Hurry up, soldier!
My friend is down there.
I am sure the rope did not break.
My brother broke it.
He is definitely plotting something.
You cannot go down there.
- Run away from here.
- No.
If I do not go down there and run away
your brother's suspicion
will change into belief.
And he will know that
the one he is looking for
is none other than me.
That is why
I have to go down there.
Dhananand!
Your Highness,
I am sure you are very happy
to see the remains
of both your enemies
Chandragupta and Chanakya.
But let us go now, Your Highness.
King Ambhiraj is waiting for you.
- Let us go, Your Highness.
- Fool.
You are a fool.
What do you think?
That the rope broke on its own?
I cut it.
With my sword.
- But.. Why, Your Highness?
- Why?
Because I suspect
Chandragupta and Chanakya
escaped this pit
with the help of this tree.
And suspicion has no place in my life.
That is why I want
you to help me find out
what had happened
in this lifeless pit.
How did Chandragupta
and Chanakya get out
of this pit with
the help of this tree?
You will show me how they got out.
And you are with me.
I am very pleased.
- Impossible.
- What?
It is impossible
to get out of this pit.
Had you known Chandragupta
you would not have said that.
Until there is even one
possibility of getting out
I cannot believe that
any of the skeletons
here belongs to
Chandragupta or Chanakya.
Now, start the game.
Climb.
'Release!'
Climb the tree.
Lady, if God had
wanted to listen to you
He would have listened five years ago
when Chandra was thrown in that pit.
Let the queen pray, Stulbhadra.
A mother's prayer has way
more power than a warrior's strength.
And about that pit
this adverse situation does
present him with a golden opportunity.
- Golden opportunity?
- Yes.
Golden opportunity.
Do not forget, that very pit
was home to Chandragupta
for five years.
He has learned a lot from that pit.
It was his playground and his school.
From that pit, Chandragupta learned
that no matter how
adverse the situation is
one must never give up hope.
In that very pit Chandragupta
stared in the eyes of death
and fought with it.
And he got out alive.
Even if Dhananand is
entering that pit today
Chandragupta is way more
familiar with it.
No matter how powerful
a king Dhananand is
it is impossible for him
to defeat Chandragupta
in that pit.
'Where are you, Chandra?'
'What is taking you so long?'
'What is brother doing to you?'
Good! Very good.
Climb.
If that Chandragupta can do it
then so can you, Arya. Climb!
'I will have to make
Dhananand believe'
'that it is impossible
to escape from here.'
Your Highness!
Get up quickly!
Chanakya and Chandragupta
are so stubborn
that they must have
tried innumerable times.
Even you will have to try constantly.
- Your Highness, I was just..
- Get up quickly and climb!
Hurry up!
I have my eyes on you, Arya.
Do not repeat your last mistake.
Place your leg there
and climb that branch.
Yes! That is the right way!
Now, jump and climb up
using those creepers.
Forgive me, Your Highness!
But this branch is not
high enough for me to jump
and reach those creepers!
If Chandragupta escaped from here
he must have jumped from that branch!
If he can jump, you can do it as well!
Jump!
Useless!
You rendered everything useless!
I think you are now convinced
that Chanakya and Chandragupta
have died in this prison.
Am I right, Your Highness?
No. I am not convinced.
I think that if tried repeatedly
one can escape from
here using that tree!
Why?
Do you not think so?
Even if not today I will keep
trying to uncover the truth.
Someday or the other,
I will find the truth.
Forgive me, Acharya.
I will go to that pit.
What are you saying, Queen Mura?
Yes. Until now,
there was an on-going battle
between a warrior's courage
and a mother's love.
The warrior has lost
and mother's love has won.
Now, I do not want to
be an infallible warrior.
I will go there
and make sure that my son is safe.
My Lady, I will accompany you.
Queen Mura..
Chandra, are you all right?
- Yes, Mother.
- He was saved today.
But I wonder how long
he will remain safe.
Because he loves to play the game
of life and death with my brother.
Today, fates favoured him.
- But tomorrow..
- Yes.. You are right, Princess.
There is no guarantee that
luck will persist to be in my favour
as I am being forced to work
with you to attain my goal.
Chandragupta! Tell me what
happened over there, with Dhananand?
Acharya, I made him believe
that it is not easy to
get out of that death trap.
But, Dhananand is
still doubtful about it.
If it is so, then before
he gets deeper into his doubt
we have to proceed
further with our next plan.
- What is the next plan?
- Yes.
We have to sow the seeds of suspicion
between Seleucus and Ambiraj.
Acharya, you are discussing
more than you should
in Durdhara's presence.
I think it is dangerous
to trust her so much.
No, Chandragupta!
Princess Durdhara will
not betray us anymore.
After all she is a princess.
She would have learnt the
lessons of politics as well.
So, she knows it very well
that if she betrays us once again
you won't hesitate even
for a moment to finish her.
You will kill her.
So, tell me, Acharya.
How do we proceed further.
Take this medicinal preparation.
This is our weapon in this plan.
But Acharya, what is this
medicinal preparation for?
To reduce the effect of alcohol.
But Acharya,
how can this help create differences
between Ambiraj and Seleucus?
It will surely work.
This medicinal preparation
will give rise to Seleucus' doubt
about Dhananand and
Ambiraj's friendship.
This will be the reason
for their difference of opinions.
Water!
It has its own properties.
It forms into ice during cold.
It evaporates as vapour when heated.
If it kept in a temperature
which is neither too cool nor too hot
then it pours as rain.
But, in every situation
it retains its properties
it does not lose it.
This very nature of water
should be adopted by us
to succeed in politics.
The thing to be understood
over here is that
nothing is permanent in politics.
neither enmity nor friendship.
If anything is stable
it is the goal.
To achieve that goal
sometimes we have
to compromise with some
and sometimes sever
ties with some other.
That is when we can reach our target
and retain our characteristics.
My ethics..
Your destiny.
After getting drunk last
night King Ambiraj asked
for this medicine to become sober.
Even you may be in need of this.
How would I get high when
I did not get drunk last night?
Wait!
If you felt I was drinking
with Ambiraj last night
that means, he was with someone else.
Apart from me, if there is anyone else
matching up to our standards
it is just one person. Dhananand!

================================================================================

Episode: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_u7jXZ9LT5Y

Forgive me. Please, forgive me.
Please forgive me, Your Highness.
You are here.
What are you doing here?
Forgive me for waking you up.
But I came here to keep this medicine.
What's this medicine for?
After getting drunk last night,
King Ambiraj
asked for this medicine
to become sober.
So, I thought even you
would have got drunk last night.
Even you may be in need of this.
That's why, I brought this medicine,
Your Highness.
How would I get high when
I did not get drunk last night?
Get lost.
Apologies. F-Forgive me, Shah.
Wait!
Yes.
- Yes, Your Highness.
- If you felt
I was drinking with Ambiraj last night
that means, he was with someone else.
But with who?
Your Highness, I am just a soldier.
How would I know who king Ambiraj
was with last night?
You are rich people.
You socialise only with the rich!
Someone of your standard.
You are right.
Apart from me, if there is anyone
else matching up to our standards
it is just one person.
Dhananand!
Yes. Your Highness,
you are absolutely right.
In fact,
they are would be co-in-laws now.
In our country,
there's no other bonding
matching up to the bonding
between co-in-laws.
You are a foreigner, right?
Perhaps,
you may find all this useless.
But the marriages
and a good familiarity
is very important for a strong base
in a relationship.
Mark my words, Your Highness.
By the time this wedding is completed,
king Dhananand and king Ambiraj
will get more closer.
Their relationship will
lead to a firm friendship.
Your Highness, I am sorry
to disturb you at this hour.
But I will take your leave.
'Your medicine did what was needed,
Acharya.'
'This medicine has implanted hatred
for Dhananand within Seleucus.'
'Now, this hatred
will gradually spread'
'and break the alliance between
Magadh and Takshashila.'
Your Majesty
what evidence can we find
in princess Durdhara's room?
There cannot be a stronger
evidence than this
to prove Chandragupta
is alive, Amatya.
I did not get you, Your Majesty.
In the last five years
Durdhara did not even touch
the paint and the paintbrushes.
Whereas, she is painting
colourful pictures now.
No.
These..
They are not just paintings, Amatya.
They are desires.
Chandragupta has returned
to end something he started.
Forgive me, Your Majesty.
If Chandragupta was alive, he
would be in Magadh and not over here.
Because he has just one
motive and that is your throne.
In last five years
there was no such incident that
would prove Chandragupta is alive.
Amatya
the bird seized inside the cage
has a quite weird thinking.
Either it will resign to its fate.
Or, will keep waiting
for the right time
and opportunity to
escape from the cage.
Chanakya and Chandragupta
are doing the same thing.
And even my sister as well.
I tried to arrest Durdhara.
I foiled her plan
about that monastery.
I even set the monastery on fire.
But my sister did not react at all.
It means that she is
ignoring these minor things
and is completely focused on her goal.
I have a gut feeling, Amatya Rakshas
that Chandragupta
and Chanakya are alive.
And they are the ones
who are instigating
my sister against me.
What happened?
Did you not understand it?
Let me explain it to you
in my sister's language.
With the help of
illustrations like this.
Actually, I am not an
expert in making illustrations
but I am definitely going to try.
So, first of all, let me draw
the place where this story started.
That is Takshashila.
I will start from the latest incident
which took place recently.
Ambiraj had taken me to the place
where Chandragupta was
seen alive for the last time.
When I had been to
Takshashila to sign a pact
I was ambushed.
A fatal attack was made on me.
Instead of me, my sister
saved that attacker.
She surrendered herself
in place of that attacker.
Not just that,
my beloved sister, Durdhara
agreed to marry that worthless prince,
Ambikumar.
'I am sure'
'that my brother would not have
found a better match than you for me'
'even if he had searched the whole world.'
And she even went
for an outing with him
that too to such a place where
no one even thinks of visiting.
And when I made my people
set that monastery on fire
I saw the same pain,
resentment on her face
which she had when
I had set the palace on fire
in which Chandragupta
and his mates were.
'You set the monastery
on fire to kill the person'
'who had made an attack on you.'
'Wait and watch.'
'Someone will again rise
like a phoenix from these ashes'
'to revolt against you.'
Did you get it now, Chief Minister?
Every incident,
every sequence indicates
that cockroach,
Chandragupta is still alive.
My spies are fully prepared,
Your Highness.
Give me permission.
I will send my spies behind her.
No.
No, Chief Minister.
My sister did not react
even after I burnt down
the monastery to ashes.
It means,
something is going on in her mind.
Chief Minister, she is my sister.
Allow her to do whatever she wants.
Even, I want to see, after all,
what is going on in her mind.
I have planted the seeds
of suspicion in Seleucus' mind
that, Ambiraj and Dhananand
might get together
and betray him.
Now, it is your job
to work further on it.
Your
would-be husband
I mean, Ambikumar
is coming here for his practices.
We have to cause a fight
between him and Seluecus's soldiers.
Princess
I hope you know what
you are supposed to do.
Prince
Prince why should you pick this up
when I am present here to do it?
Please allow me to do it.
Whatever may be the case you never
miss out on your practise sessions.
I am so impressed to see that,
a true warrior like you
is so focused and dedicated.
Today, it is going
to be even more special.
Because today, in his practise session
he will witness his
would-be wife fight with him
with a sword in her hand
and respect in her heart.
Don't worry, Prince.
I am more than just
a delicate princess.
Okay.
You are giving me surprises everyday,
Princess.
Let's go.
Hey soldier, get me my sword.
This is not your Magadh
and we are not your slaves
that, we should follow your orders.
How dare you show such audacity
and show disrespect to Magadh.
Before I render you
incapable of doing anything
get me my sword.
Oh!
How dare you do this!
How can you touch your future queen?
Princess
How can you be so reckless
with your future queen!
I did not do anything to her.
I was only handing
over her sword to her.
You mean to say, I am lying!
Look at his impudence, Prince.
First of all, he disrespected me.
Then, he tried to touch me
and now, he is trying to say that,
I am a liar!
Prince! Prince!
I think, before this gets fuelled up
I should escort the
princess to her chamber.
No, Arya.
Before that, this soldier
will apologize to the princess.
He will go down on
his knees and do that.
If not, he will not be alive
to see the light of the day.
That will not happen.
He is into at fault.
If you raise even a finger
towards Greek we will not tolerate it.
Yes, we will not tolerate!
Wow.
Kudos to you,
Chandragupta and Durdhara.
This is going to be fun.
You!
Come with me.
Emperor Dhananand wishes to meet you.
But, why?
Why does the emperor want to meet me?
W-What does he want from me?
- Prince, listen to me..
- Arya..
I am capable of
avenging the humiliation
caused to princess Durdhara.
You can go from here.
I said, get out of here!
This is the last warning.
You better apologise to the princess.
Let's go.
So, I tried to touch you!
You made noise to prove me wrong!
What if I try to touch you in real?
Get back!
Ambikumar!
Save me.
Did you see that?
You Indians are all the same.
You are not worthy of anything!
Today, you have committed two sins,
and not one.
Firstly, you disrespected a woman.
Secondly,
you humiliated my mother land.
Now, I will show you
what we Indians can do
to save the motherland
and the dignity of women!
Excellent, Arya! I am proud of you!
There you go, Prince.
Ask him to apologise.
Let him bow down in
front of the princess!
Come on. Apologise to the princess.
Hold on, Ambi Kumar!
Let go off my soldier right away!
How dare you raise
your hand on my soldier!
At times, when there are
differences in relationships
we feel that it is preferably
good to estrange those relationship.
But if you had any problems
with your hands or legs
would you detach them from your body?
No, you would not.
You would rather treat them
and not detach them from your body.
Similarly
if there are any differences
or any confusion in the relationships
you must fix it.
You should not break the
tie to end the relationship.
Remember this!
Relationship is like our body.
If there are any differences
it is good to treat them
with courage and knowledge.
My ethics..
Your destiny.
He is aware that we are alive.
And as long as we are alive
we will not let him fulfill
his dream of ruling Paurav kingdom.
What should we do now?
Dhananand will receive a special gift
on his sister's pre-wedding ritual.

================================================================================

Episode: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTa_lM5_i-Q

Your Majesty, please forgive him.
What are you saying, Father?
I am telling the right thing.
Apologise to His Majesty.
I had told you, Father, that they
were humiliating Durdhara.
And how could I remain silent
in such a situation?
Perhaps, you are forgetting
that she is my future fiance.
And it is my duty to save
her honour.
Prince Ambikumar, every story
has two sides.
I heard the other side
of the story from my soldiers.
But no matter what the reason is
you should not have
attacked my soldiers.
He is right.
You should not have attacked
his soldiers.
Your Majesty,
in my opinion,
let us end this matter here.
Let us not stretch it.
Please forgive him.
He committed a blunder.
You have made a mistake.
Apologise to him and leave.
No. I have not made any mistake.
They deserved it.
I will not apologise to anyone.
Let him think
whatever he wants to.
I will not apologise to him.
Ambhiraj, I think your son
is forgetting why he
and his father, that is you,
have been still alive.
Because I did not shed
the amount of blood
that I have shed
in entire Asia, here.
Instead, I acted peacefully.
But I guess your son does
not understand
the language of peace.
Now the decision is yours,
Ambhiraj.
Apologise to him.
Did you not hear me?
Apologise to him right now.
I.. I made a mistake
by attacking your soldiers.
Please forgive me.
Your Majesty, even you forget
your anger.
Please forgive him.
He made a mistake
out of his ignorance.
Do not worry. He will never
repeat it in the future.
He lost his senses in anger.
The ones who lose their senses
in anger are often
seen to be bleeding.
I hope you will
remember it, Ambhiraj.
Yes.
Forgive me, Your Majesty.
If you permit me, may this
humble guy say something?
Your Majesty, do not give
importance to this incident.
Well, when weak people get
too much power
this is what happens.
Prince Ambikumar is going
to get married to the princess
whose brother has entire India
under his control.
I mean, now, even Ambikumar
will get immense power.
Now tell me, Your Majesty, what
is Ambikumar's fault in this?
He is not capable
of handling so much power.
He ended up insulting you
due to his arrogance of power.
If not, has he ever behaved like
this with you, Your Majesty?
He has not, right?
Just give him some time.
Once he gets married, he will
learn to take care
of the powers that he would
get with his marriage.
Your Majesty..
Your Majesty, did you call me?
Is there any important task?
'Now four dishes will
be placed before him.'
'And he has to taste them
and give the details'
'of the ingredients.'
'Before you start the challenge,
I would like to inform you'
'that
one of these bowls
contains poison.'
'He has got a doubt
that I am Stulbhadra.'
'That is why he wants to do
the same thing to me'
'that he had done years ago.'
'Dhananand will test me like
he had done earlier.'
Army Chief, have these sweets.
'If I refuse even a little,
he will get more suspicious.'
'And the next strike
will be on Chandra.'
What are you thinking?
Hurry up and have the sweets.
Pardon me, Your Majesty.
How can I eat in front of you?
That would be breach
of decorum, right?
Nothing is above
His Majesty's order.
Did you not hear what he said?
Come on, have it.
Why is he taking so long?
I hope the rift of suspicion
that is between Ambhiraj
and Seleucus has become wider..
Their differences
have grown bigger.
Come to my chamber.
I have something important
to tell you.
I am in no mood to
follow your orders, now.
Got it?
After the little success that,
we achieved today I am sure
you wouldn't want me
to back out from this
and all your plans for the future
go in for a toss.
I thought as much.
Do you need a special permission
to finish off the sweets Mr. Soldier!
No.
I am having it, Emperor.
'Chandragupta please forgive me
for whatever I have done.'
'Perhaps, today is the last day
of my life.'
'I only regret the fact that,
'I could not meet you
and say goodbye to you.'
So, tell me
how did you like the sweets?
What are your comments?
What!
What do you mean, Emperor?
Stulbhadra don't waste time.
Hurry up and tell us
your feedback
about the sweets.
I had mentioned to the emperor that,
you are a resident of Taxila.
It is quite evident from your health
that, you are a foodie.
That is why,
the emperor has called you here
so that, you can taste them
and tell us
which one of them
is the tastiest of all!
Okay.
Is that why, emperor..
I mean you had called for me.
By the way right since childhood
I have been drawn towards Laddus.
But this one has been made
using high quality
ingredients, too.
Very well made.
And, Emperor this has been
made using clarified ghee.
But still, I will try
to be unbiased
and make a judgment
about one of the sweets
from here.
It has to be
this one.
It is this, Emperor.
This has been made
with pure milk and cheese.
Wow.
You will not find something more
pure than this in the entire Taxila.
Okay.
Fine. Shipra get this sweet made.
And take him away from here
now as he is getting on my nerves.
Okay, Emperor.
'I have had
a narrow escape today.'
Do you know what you are
doing with me right now
is no less than blackmailing.
This is exactly,
why I did not want you
to be a part of the plan.
What is all this?
Medicines for your wounds.
My wounds are okay
without medicines.
I am a princess
and you have protected
my honour today.
- That is why..
- So what?
Do you feel that now
you will make me
follow your orders?
Yes, I feel that.
Princess Durdhara
I am not your slave.
I said, sit here quietly.
I want to apply medicines
in your wounds.
Or else, you'll be responsible
for whatever happens with you.
Do not blame me.
Okay.
Calm down.
Quiet.
Okay I'll sit.
Give me your hand.
Both the hands.
Shall I say something?
You must get a medicine made
for your anger.
Your anger is notdangerous
for Acharya's strategy
but it is not good
for your own health.
Since when did you start
worrying about my health?
Why would I be concerned
about your health?
It was just an advice.
Attention!
His Majesty Dhananand
is arriving!
You have to hide somewhere.
Immediately.
Trust me, Acharya.
He is Dhananand.
He can do anything anytime.
But ever since he has
come back from that pit
he seems to be anxious
and restless.
I thought,
he has recognised me.
He wanted my suggestion
about the sweets.
So that he learns
which sweet is the best.
And so that he can
get it made.
He has gone mad.
Dhananand is getting
sweets made?
That too, 200 Kilograms.
This is not all.
Shipra has taken
information from me.
Like which is the biggest
hermitage in Taxila.
Where can we find the best
quality mangoes in Taxila?
He is going
to buy a garden.
Her Highness..
That means,
Dhananand has
played his next move.
My dear sister!
I am here to surprise you.
I have got
something special for you.
None of your gifts
surprise me anymore.
But this will certainly
surprise you.
All of you come inside.
What is all this?
This is the arrangement
for your pre-wedding ritual.
Hereafter,
you will officially
be Prince Ambikumar's fiance.
I had told you
that this gift of mine
will surprise you.
Whatever happened
during the practice..
Do not worry
about that.
Your brother has
fixed everything.
I have cleared
all the misunderstandings.
I have told
my friend, Seleucus
that we have to unite both of you
in order to remove this
malign and bitterness.
That is why, we will perform
the pre-wedding ritual today.
I am yet to make
the arrangements.
Let us proceed.
Shall we go?
A crooked person
like Dhananand
does not let his feelings
known to anyone.
But his behaviour
is pointing towards one thing.
He is aware
that I am alive.
And as long as I am alive
I will not let him fulfil his dream
of ruling Paurav kingdom.
And in his eagerness
to fulfil his dream
he is performing the pre-wedding
ritual of his sister tonight.
Acharya..
What should we do now?
Chandragupta..
It is time to fulfil Dhananand's
most dangerous dream.
How?
Leave that to me.
Dhananand will receive
a special gift
on his sister's
pre-wedding ritual.
When this salty water
of the ocean evaporates
then it forms clouds.
But after being transformed
into clouds
the salty water
becomes sweet.
Similarly, when you get
negativity in life
then that does not mean
that we cannot make it positive.
If your will power is strong
then you can transform
the salty water into sweet
just like the clouds.
Negativity can be
changed into positivity.
One should have
strong will power.
Principles are mine, fate is yours.
Dhananand from now on Chandragupta and
I will have continous watch on you.
And your dream of annexing Paurava
state would be shattered.
As Parurava state would
not be yours but ours.

================================================================================

Episode: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vINYDHFWw9Y

We are fortunate
that Dhananand decided to
get you married at the earliest.
And he forgot about the differences
between Seleucus and you.
Otherwise, enmity with Seleucus
would have cost you.
In future,
do not make a mistake
for which we will have to suffer
throughout our lives.
Attention!
His Majesty Dhananand and Princess
Durdhara are arriving.
Take a look.
Your beautiful, powerful
and wealthy
future wife is arriving.
Greetings, Your Majesty.
Your Majesty,
kindly take your seat.
Proceed.
Did you see that, Amatya?
We often see the brides
chirping happily
during their wedding rituals.
But look at my sister.
It seems as if the bird
is going to get locked
in the cage.
She is losing her hopes.
That means, my dearest sister
is thinking about someone else.
She is performing
this ritual with Ambikumar
but she loves someone else.
And who could it be
other than Chandragupta?
So, this is clear
that Chandragupta is alive.
And not just
that wretched Chandragupta
but the crooked Brahman,
Chanakya is also alive.
'The crooked Brahman, Chanakya!'
Your Majesty, what happened?
Nothing.
'You have played
your move, Dhananand.'
'It is our turn now.'
'We shall change the game
right in front of you.'
'We shall ruin your game.'
Move ahead, Dhananand.
And witness your worst nightmare
come true.
Where is this crooked Brahman?
Here I am, Dhananand.
You used to say
that you are watching here,
there and everywhere.
But I was right under your nose.
And you did not even realise it.
You were relieved thinking
that we got burnt
inside Hawa Mahal.
No, Dhananand.
All of us are alive.
And we were in Takshashila.
Dhananand, remember
one thing.
Chandragupta and I will be
watching you all the time.
Whom you meet,
and what you do and when..
We will stay informed about it.
And your dream
to rule the Paurav Kingdom
and all the strategies
you are making to fulfil it..
All your plans will fail.
And your dream
will fade away.
Because the Paurav Empire is
going to be ours and not yours.
Stop blabbering
all this rubbish.
Enough of your lecture
and game plans.
Stupid Brahman you are
going to die today.
Your Highness it is me
Amatya Rakshas.
What happened, Your Highness?
That cunning Chanakya
had come, Chief Minister.
Vishnugupta!
It means that he is still alive.
But, why had he come
here, Your Highness?
To challenge me.
He had come to mock at me,
Chief Minister.
That he will conquer the
Paurav Empire right under my nose.
He had come to challenge me.
Chanakya,
you committed a blunder
by showing yourself to me.
Wait and watch
how I am going to turn
this game around now.
Now, that Paurav Empire will
come under my control
that too, with your end.
Pardon me, Your Highness.
You gaining control over
the Paurav Empire
is dependent on Durdhara
and Ambikumar's marriage.
Actually, if you see, Durdhara
is on Chanakya and
Chandragupta's side.
Do not worry about my sister,
Chief Minister.
Because she is my sister.
But now, Chanakya is
definitely going to die.
'By now, Dhananand would
have met the acharya.'
'But why has Dhananand
not returned yet?'
Where is the bride's brother,
Ambiraj?
What can be
more important to him
than his sister's engagement?
Maybe, some important work
has come up.
How about having
this engagement later?
Moreover,
I do not want to get engaged
in my brother's absence.
No, no, Sister.
What can be more important to me
than your engagement?
I was missing from here
for a short duration
because I wanted
to get a special gift
for this special couple.
Such a gift seeing which
these two will be surprised.
Come on, let us start
with the engagement rituals.
Chief Minister, inform all
the major parties of Takshashila
and Paurav Empire
that I will be making
such an announcement
tomorrow morning
which will foil all the planning
of that Chanakya.
Okay, Your Highness.
'What is going on here?'
'Dhananand should have
been taken aback'
'after meeting the acharya.'
'But seeing him, it seems like
he has already started'
'to work on
the next part of his plan.'
'What is going to happen
early morning tomorrow?'
'What is Dhananand
planning to do?'
Hail Emperor Dhananand!
Hail Emperor Dhananand!
Hail Emperor Dhananand!
Hail Emperor Dhananand!
Princess, do you have any idea
what gift your brother
is planning to give us?
No idea, Prince.
My brother keeps surprising me every
day with some new gift.
I wonder what surprise
he has for me today.
Hail Emperor Dhananand!
Hail Emperor Dhananand!
Hail Emperor Dhananand!
Hail Emperor Dhananand!
'Chandragupta, I am sure that
you are more prepared than me'
'for the surprise
my brother is about to give.'
'No matter what that gift is'
'I just want you
to be prepared.'
Surprising.
He has gathered everyone in
Takshashila to make this announcement.
I hope the surprise he
is about to announce
really surprises everyone.
I have a hunch what this
announcement is going to be.
People of Takshashila
after my sister's engagement
yesterday
I and Ambiraj felt that
when everything is so beautiful
and magnificent
then why should we delay
with the auspicious deed?
So, we have decided
that this wedding
will take place
before the decided time.
My beloved sister and Prince
Ambikumar will be married tomorrow.
Tomorrow,
there will be music, dance
and delicious food.
There will be alcohol.
There will be such a celebration
in Takshashila tomorrow
which no one has witnessed
before
nor anyone will in future.
Because tomorrow is my,
the king of Magadha's sister's
wedding celebrations!
Hail Emperor Dhananand!
Hail Emperor Dhananand!
Immediately after the wedding,
King Dhananand
will declare the new successor
of the Paurav Kingdom.
Victory to Takshashila!
Victory to Paurav!
Victory to Takshashila!
Victory to Paurav!
Victory to Takshashila!
Victory to Paurav!
What next, Acharya?
Why are you worried,
Chandragupta?
Get rid of all your worries.
When I went before Dhananand,
I realised right then
that he would surely make such an
announcement by getting distracted.
I did not get you, Acharya.
When I went before him
I could sense from his behaviour
that he is suspecting
Durdhara of having some
connections with us.
That is why,
I told him intentionally
that we will watch him always,
hereafter.
Whom he will meet and where, what he
does and the discussions he will have..
We will get to know everything
about it.
And this shrewd man
can go to any extent
to gain control
over the situation.
That is the reason he
declared his sister's
wedding well before the fixed date.
But this fool does not know
that his announcement
will prove to
be very useful to us.
You mean,
the wedding preparations
will act like a covering
for our plan.
Undoubtedly.
So, Acharya what will
be our next plan?
For our plan to be successful
the most useful link
is the commander-in-chief
of Paurav Kingdom.
Rudra Dev Singh!
Commander Rudra Dev!
Rudra Dev
the commander-in-chief
of Paurav Kingdom.
Once Paurav Kingdom
is under your rule
he will be your left-hand man.
In the war against Alexander
you were among Puru's
foot soldiers, right?
You are ordinary
but a vigilant warrior.
I am not surprised
how you became
the commander
of the Paurav Kingdom.
Thank you, Your Majesty.
I will fulfil my responsibilities
to my best
and with complete loyalty.
I will take your leave,
Your Majesty.
That's exactly
what I like
about the Kshatriyas.
Irrespective of who
they are loyal to
if at all they are prepared
to serve someone
they definitely remain loyal
to them.
I can help you get rid of your
anger and frustration, Rudra Dev.
Acharya, it's you!
Acharya, you are alive?
Yes, Rudra Dev.
I am alive.
I don't have time to explain
everything right now.
I will tell you
something very important.
Listen carefully.
I know, even today,
your loyalty is towards
the late King Puru
and the people of Paurav.
But tomorrow, the new emperor
of Paurav Kingdom
will be the king of Magadha,
Dhananand.
I know very well
that there is no single person
in the entire Paurav Kingdom,
including you
who wishes to see that crook
taking up the throne of Paurav.
There is not a single person
in Paurav Kingdom
who would want Dhananand
the one who betrayed
their late king
to take up his throne, today.
Chandragupta.
If you give us the support
of your Paurav army
I assure you
that Dhananand will never
become the king of Paurav.
Stop the Paurav king's
tradition from vanishing.
The decision is yours
and the promise, ours.
Do you see this creeper?
It can never grow
on its own
but if it gets the support
of the wood
it will not just grow
but also flourish.
Similarly, no matter who you are
do not consider yourself
incapable.
Always be prepared to help
and support others
because when you help
someone else
you are not just
protecting his identity
but you are enhancing
your own personality.
The ethics are mine.
The destiny is yours.
- Arya.
- Forgive me, my Prince.
I failed to notice you.
All right.
This dagger will sever the
deep relationship
between Ambhiraj and Seleucus.
This is one attack
you cannot escape from.

================================================================================

Episode: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dt_8dVdjmNE

If you give us military
support of Paurav
I promise to you that Dhananand
will never become Paurav king.
Stop the eradication
of Paurav kings' tradition.
The decision will be yours
and the promise will be ours.
Oh! So you are Chandragupta,
Piplivan's Prince.
The future emperor of India
chosen by Chanakya.
Yes, I am Chandragupta Maurya.
I have only heard
about you until now.
But your firm determination,
I believe what I heard was true.
Well, Rudradev?
Will you help us
in our revolution?
Acharya, I respect
you and your dream.
I know you are working very hard
to make your dream true.
But, Acharya, people of Paurav have
nothing left to struggle about.
Who do we fight for?
For whose honour do we fight?
For whose pride do we fight?
You know that King Puru's
genealogy has ended.
After Prince Malayketu,
we do not have a single ray
of hope left.
No heir lives anymore.
People of the state have no
desire for independence anymore.
Even if I gather the entire
Paurav army and give it to you
you will not be able to last
against Dhananand for long.
It is because only you two
are truly fighting against him.
I do not have any purpose or any
reason for this revolution and war.
People of Paurav
have bore
bloodbath and war.
They have suffered
in it, Acharya
Knowing Dhananand's
cruelty and his military might
I cannot allow them to get
into a horrifying revolution.
He wants to obtain Paurav
kingdom any way he can.
If King Puru were live
and in my position
he might have taken
the same decision.
Because it is about the
protection of Paurav kingdom.
Forgive me, Acharya.
I cannot help you.
Are you upset by his rejection,
Chandragupta?
No.
I have already thought
about the next solution.
Is that so?
What is it?
We somehow have to get
Seleucus by tomorrow morning.
To achieve that, we must increase
the conflict between him and Ambhiraj.
We have to end
the trust between them.
Only then can we make
Seleucus believe that he has
to remove Ambhiraj from
the throne of Taxila
and establish his rule.
So breaking of the alliance
is good for us.
Chandragupta, I get happy
to think that you have yet
to become the emperor but you
are gradually coming to think
like an emperor.
We will do this.
Just as the rituals
of the wedding begin
our plan will be
put into action.
The alliance between
Seleucus and Ambhiraj
will be broken tomorrow.
We will use this opportunity
to free Durdhara.
I can understand what you are
thinking right now, Your Highness.
But you should give up on the idea of
searching for Chandragupta now.
That is best
for you and your future.
I do not wish to talk
to anyone right now.
You have been given the duty
of carrying of the ritual of turmeric.
So focus solely on that.
Do you get it?
Yes, Your Highness.
I instructed Shipra very much
but Durdhara still would
not reveal the secret.
She would not tell even her
best friend about her feelings.
Do you get it, Amatya?
Yes, Your Majesty.
The plans against me
are being made to this extent.
And my own sister
is involved in them.
It will not be easy to find
out about Chandragupta
and his accomplices
despite presenting
Durdhara as a sacrifice.
So I want you to leave
some chink in her security.
Go out of her sight deliberately.
Give her an opportunity
she would not ignore
even if she wants to.
Only then will we be able to
get to that boy and his accomplices.
As you wish, Your Majesty.
That is what I will do.
Amatya, make sure my sister does
not get harm in all this.
Do not worry, Your Majesty.
It is my duty
to protect her.
As long as I am alive, nothing
bad will happen to her.
Chanakya..
I have laid my trap.
You, Chandragupta
and all your accomplices
will get caught in it.
And I will do what I could not
by killing you!
It is time.
We must split up
to execute our plan.
Chandragupta
you will attack Seleucus.
Make it look like
the attack
was carried out
by Ambhiraj.
This will build up
their suspicion of one another.
And when our plan
gains momentum
that is the perfect time
to free Durdhara
from the palace.
The group of entertainers hired
to perform at Durdhara's
wedding are approaching.
Give me permission.
Ma'am.
I will wait for you at the
South gate with the carriage.
'Be warned, Dhananand.'
'Soon, Chandragupta
will foil your plans'
'and take off with Durdhara
from right under your nose.'
'If'
'Shipra is right'
'why do I still hope,
that Chandragupta will come'
'and rescue me
from this sham of a marriage?'
'He had already made it clear'
'that I bring him
nothing but pain.'
'And that, the first chance
he gets he will get rid of me.'
'This is his chance'
'to be free of me.'
Durdhara.
We may have our differences
and arguments,
but still I believe, a women
should never be forced
into a marriage.
To marry out of love
and with consent
is the right way.
Otherwise it is wrong.
So, no matter what happens
I will definitely rescue you
from this sham of a marriage.
My lovely sister.
You look so beautiful.
And even more so
when you accept
my decisions
without questions or arguments.
Everything will be
all right tomorrow.
You will get married and
the Paurav kingdom
will be mine.
If things were indeed
as you had planned
you would not be this hasty
in getting me married.
Changing the date of the wedding
shows that you are afraid.
'You may pretend
to be full of confidence'
'but your eyes
say otherwise.'
'I can clearly see
in them'
'that you are afraid.'
'Afraid that Chandragupta might
show up to wreck your plans.'
- Arya.
- Oh! Forgive me, my Prince.
I was in a rush
to run errands for the marriage
that I failed to notice
you.
Prince. You are
still without your attire?
The ceremony could
start any moment now.
And the 'Turmeric Ritual'
will begin as well.
I sent Durgam Singh to fetch
my attire and the accessories.
but he is no where
to be seen.
Those Yavan soldiers
were right.
Indians are lazy
and idle.
They cannot be trusted.
They are poor!
- They are..
- Calm down, Prince.
For such a small matter
it is wrong
to curse the nation.
I do not care about
the nation!
Once I become the son-in-law
to this kingdom
I will enlist only Yavan soldiers
into my army.
I like their work.
They are hard working
and loyal.
Do not worry, Prince.
I will bring you the attire
to your chambers.
All right.
Now your dagger
will sever the deep relationship
between Ambhiraj and Seleucus.
This is one attack
you cannot escape
from.
Stop!
That is enough.
Enough of turmeric
application.
Stop this!
Who called you here?
I do not need all this.
Ask them to leave.
Did you not hear the princess?
Get out of here!
Yes, we will leave.
But please pay us
for our performance.
Please give us a gift at least.
You..
Do not worry.
No injustice will be meted out to you
as long as Chandragupta is alive.
'Stulbhadra is
waiting for you'
'at the southern gate
with a coach.'
'I have kept a dancer's costume
for you in Rose Chamber.'
'Go and wear the costume.'
'So that we can get out of here
without any problem.'
Get out!
Go.
Get out!
Go.
All of you, get out!
I would like to apologise to you
for the inconvenience.
Now, I will be here.
So that you do not need
to experience any inconvenience.
Certainly.
'I need to go to Rose Chamber
as soon as possible'
'without being noticed
by Amatya Rakshas.'
'In our country'
'when two families
get into an alliance'
'their bonding becomes
stronger.'
'Mark my words, Your Highness!'
'Emperor Dhananand
and King Ambhiraj'
'will come closer
after this wedding.'
'They will become
close friends.'
'You made a mistake.
Apologise to Emperor Seleucus'
'and go from here.'
'No, I did not make
any mistake.'
'They deserved this.'
'And I will not apologise
to him.'
'Everything is so beautiful
and grand.'
'Why should we delay
the auspicious event then?'
'Hence, we have decided'
'that this wedding
will take place'
'before the scheduled date.'
Your Highness, the wedding
celebration has begun.
Everyone one is waiting for you.
I have nothing to do
with this wedding.
I do not care.
I have no relationship
with the bride and the groom.
Why should I attend
this wedding?
- Go from here.
- But Your Highness..
I said, leave!
Who is there?
'Amatya Rakshas, it will not be
easy to trace Chandragupta'
'and his aides despite
using Durdhara as a pawn.'
'Hence, I want you to ensure'
'that there should be a
security lapse in Durdhara's security.'
'You intentionally disappear
from her sight.'
I will present your enemy in front
of you very soon, Your Highness.
We use several methods
to protect ourselves
from the severe heat of the sun.
We sprinkle
water outside
our house and make it moist.
So that when the air flows
through the moist surface
of the ground it absorbs the
heat and comfort us.
This means,
when all three elements
water, soil and air, have a good
coordination among themselves
they achieve their goal
very easily.
Similarly, an effective plan
is not enough
to achieve a desired goal in life.
It is important
that all the elements
who are part of the plan
have a good coordination
among themselves.
Only then will a desired
goal be achieved.
Teachings are mine,
decisions are yours.
Where is Dhurdhara?

================================================================================

Episode: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uO5PJ8fiQOs

Your Highness, I was
looking for you.
The function is about to start.
Let us go.
- I was attacked?
- Attack!
- What are you saying?
- The attacker ran away
in that direction.
Soldiers!
What is going on?
Your Highness, when I heard
the soldiers were
chasing someone,
I came this way.
And I saw this person
running away.
But when he saw me,
he attacked me.
So, I stopped him.
You did good, Arya.
Uncover him.
I want to see who dared to attack me.
As you command,
Your Highness.
'Acharya, what are you
doing here?'
'What did you think?
That I will leave you alone'
'in this situation? Come.'
'Chandragupta,
here is the plan.'
'Cover Ambikumar
with your cloak.'
'Hurry.'
Ambikumar!
Traitor!
Your Highness!
Your Highness,
this is not possible.
It must be some mistake.
He cannot do this.
He would not do this.
He would not dare attack you.
If this is a mistake, then do
you have any evidence to prove this?
As you say, proof.
- Proof?
- Yes!
This is the same knife
with which I was attacked.
He tried to kill me!
This has Taxila's royal symbol.
Now tell me,
whose knife is it?
Do you remember?
This is Ambikumar's knife!
And I gave him this knife
on his 18th birthday.
Arrest him!
This must be some mistake.
This.. This is not possible.
It is impossible.
Ambikumar would not
attack you.
He would not dare
attack you.
This is not possible.
Stul.
Acharya, you are here!
Did Chandra accomplish his task?
Yes, Stul, everything is
going as per our plan.
Soon, this marriage and this
alliance will be called off.
But where are queen
and Durdhara?
I do not know, Acharya.
They should have reached
here by now.
Could they be in some trouble?
Do this, go and check
if Durdhara is in some trouble.
I will wait here.
Go.
Okay, Acharya.
'Where are you, Queen Mura?'
Princess, what are you
doing here?
Everyone is waiting for you.
Come with me.
I-I.. I felt suffocated
in that crowd there.
That is why I came here.
The auspicious time is passing.
We have to go soon.
Okay.
'It seems Amatya
is suspecting me.'
'And Queen Mura
could come here any moment.'
'I have to stop her
from coming here.'
'But what do I do?'
'How do I save her?'
Come, Princess.
Everyone is waiting.
At least give him a chance
to present his side.
Ambikumar is innocent.
He would not wish any harm
to you, let alone try to kill you.
Your Highness,
give him a chance.
Give Ambikumar a chance. He..
I have to go and inform
the princess.
'How? How do I save
Queen Mura?'
- Amatya.
- Yes, Princess?
I was going to run away
from this palace today.
But do not worry.
I have changed my mind.
The king changed my
wedding date
because he wanted me to rebel.
I would not let him
succeed in getting his wish
by sacrificing me.
I would not even try
to run away from here.
Let alone rebel.
Let us go and perform
the rest of the rituals.
Come.
Oh.
So Durdhara is trying to tell me
that Dhananand has planned
to catch all of us through her.
I have to save Queen Mura.
Where is Durdhara?
What is going on?
Let go of me!
I will kill you!
Understand?
He did not attack you,
friend Seleucus.
Yes, your attacker
used Ambikumar
to save himself
and create a rift
between you and Ambhiraj.
But I know
who attacked you.
'Chandragupta, I am sure
that you must have tried'
'a lot to save me
from this wedding.'
'I am thankful to you
for that.'
'But it seems like
I am
destined to marry Ambikumar.'
'And no one can escape destiny.'
Princess!
Princess!
Princess, come soon.
Prince Ambikumar has
been arrested
for attempting to kill
King Seleucus.
'Chandragupta,
I know you did this.'
'But I pray to God you escape
safely from all this.'
'Because I know
Dhananand will not let'
'this marriage
and this alliance'
'get called off at any cost.'
Free Ambikumar, friend.
He is innocent.
Yes, of course.
Of course
you would say that.
After all, he is going
to be your sister's husband.
That is why you would
definitely interfere.
But do remember
this, Dhananand.
This is my personal matter.
I will..
I will solve my personal matters
without any
outside interference.
Of course.
But as Ambhiraj
is going to be my relative
in the same way,
you are my friend, Seleucus.
The right to punish
is undoubtedly yours.
But as a friend
I will not let you punish
an innocent prince.
This is because the real culprit
is still roaming around freely
aiming to hurt you.
Punishing Ambikumar
will not only hurt
your dignity
but it will also hurt
a loving father.
How can you
be so sure about it?
You have not seen anything.
You were not there
at that time.
I am Dhananand.
I am omniscient.
Even if I was
not at the spot
I know
who attacked you.
The truth is not
what you are seeing.
All the incidents
that are taking place
have been orchestrated
splendidly, my friend.
Today, the events
that are taking place here
cannot be
a co-incidence, friend.
No.. This is a
well-thought conspiracy.
- My Lady!
- Stulbhadra!
My Lady, we have
to leave immediately.
No.
I will not leave
without Durdhara.
But she sent me
the message
that she will not
be able to accompany us.
Not only that,
but Dhananand had made this plan
to catch us through her.
- What?
- That is why
we have
to leave soon, my Lady.
Moreover,
Chandra has succeeded
in implicating Ambikumar.
He will find
a way to save Durdhara.
Come on.
Hurry up, my Lady.
Look, Dhananand.
Today, I have been attacked
in my palace.
He has tried to kill me.
I do not have time
to solve your riddles.
If he is not
the culprit, who is?
It is an insider
who has done this.
That person
wants a war to wage
between Magadha and Taxila.
That person
is against this treaty.
That person
is against this marriage.
That person
is behind this conspiracy.
He wants both of us
to be at loggerheads
so that we never
form a treaty
and also, you and Ambhiraj
become enemies.
That devil in disguise
is Arya.
How dare you
to try to implicate
Ambikumar!
- How dare..
- Ambhiraj.
Neither this place
nor this time
is right to punish him.
Soldiers! Capture him!
You are an interesting man.
You remind me
of an interesting slave
Arya.
Oh, my.. How did this happen?
Why is it so noisy here?
Is it related to Chandra
attacking Seleucus?
You tried
to entrap Ambikumar.
How dare you
look into my eyes!
Lower your gaze.
Lower your gaze!
You are too arrogant.
I will not only
break your bones
I will shatter
your arrogance as well!
Ambhiraj
this is the last opportunity
to save your life.
Kill me.
If I remain alive
no one will be able
to save you from me.
Do remember this.
What will we
do now, Acharya?
Dhananand turned
the tides in his favour.
It seems that neither
this treaty will break
nor will we be able to attain
the Paurava Kingdom.
The most important thing..
How will we save Chandra?
Do not worry
about Chandragupta, Queen.
He is akin to this fire
and his work
is to abolish the darkness
spread by Dhananand
with his magnificence.
All of us
are akin to the tinder
and we have to keep
the fire in Chandragupta going.
Whenever we are needed
even if we have
to sacrifice ourselves
we will keep the fire
in Chandragupta going.
Remember,
it is our responsibility
to ensure the same
irrespective of the situations.
We have to keep
Chandragupta alive.
Acharya is right.
Chandragupta
will not accept defeat.
We should not
accept defeat as well.
Order us.
What do we have to do?
Dhananand has made his move
after thinking thoroughly.
If he wanted, he could
have killed Chandragupta.
But he has kept him alive
for a special reason.
We have to make
our move carefully
to ensure
Chandragupta's safety
and foiling
Dhananand's plan
of acquiring
the Paurava Kingdom.
- We have only one option.
- What is it?
The stage has been
set by Dhananand
but I will be the one
who will make the moves.
Tonight will be the last night
of your life.
Ambhiraj, stop.
Ambikumar,
I do understand
your sentiments.
And I do understand
your sentiments too, Ambhiraj.
But do not need
to get carried away
by your emotions.
You need to listen
to your conscience.
It is easy to kill an enemy.
But it is difficult
to crush his goal.
Hence, we will not kill him.
We will crush his goal.
How will we do that?
Words..
Words, Ambhiraj..
Words are mightier
than weapons.
Hence, I have come here
to hear his words
and know the answer
of every question
which is important
not only to me
but also to both of you.
I know you speak less.
But I know how
to open
someone's mouth.
'Friend, release Ambikumar.
He is innocent.'
'You were not present there.'
'I was not present there.
But I know who attacked you.'
'That traitor is'
'Arya.'
I thought that Ambikumar
had tried to kill me
in the heat of the moment.
But why did Dhananand say
that Arya had attacked me
and tried to frame Ambikumar?
Why would Arya try to kill me?
What is going on?
- Chanakya.
- Wait, Emperor Seleucus.
I have come here
to talk to you.
Please don't get surprised.
This is Taxila,
my land of actions.
I know every part of this land
very well.
Nothing is impossible
for me here.
Neither is it impossible for me
to appear before you alive
nor to deceive your bodyguards
and enter your chamber.
How are you still alive?
More than this
there are other things
which are important to you.
For an example, the question
which is making you worried now,
Emperor Seleucus.
And the conspiracy
which is being hatched by Dhananand
and Ambhiraj against you.
Tell me who you are.
Nobody knows who is he
and where did he come from.
He was appointed as a direct
recruit into the army
when you attacked us.
Nobody knows anything
else apart from this.
I tried to find out about his
parents.
But neither could I find them
nor any of his relatives.
No problem.
We barbers
have a rare quality..
We know to get to the
root of the matter.
I also
possess a rare quality.
I can touch a person's hair
and find out
whether that
person was in touch with me
or not.
Touching your hair
reminds
me of a person
whom I know very well.
Don't force me
to think hard.
Tell me who are you?
Why are you smiling?
Nothing.
I feel good
to see that
the country's
most superior
emperor
the most powerful
the wealthiest
emperor Dhananand
is right in front
of me
begging for
an answer
from me.
He is very stubborn. Let us
kill him and end his chapter.
No, he will not die here.
Not like this by any chance.
But what is the reason to
keep him alive?
Because
I know who is he.
I want
him to accept
his true identity.
After that I will torture
him till his death.
My victory
over Paurava kingdom
will
be more pleasant.
My
victory will be more
satisfying to me.
Do whatever you can
Dhananand
but I
and Chanakya will not
allow you to succeed
in your plans. Never.
Arya did not have any
purpose to kill you.
He is loyal to you.
You are aware of his loyalty.
Dhananand and Ambhiraj
are together
in a conspiracy against you.
If you want to do something
against them
you only have
time till tomorrow.
That's because once
this marriage is solemnised
and if the Paurava region
comes under Dhananand
then, that day
is not far away
when you will be compelled
to return to Macedonia.
This will never happen!
King Seleucus, forgive me
in saying this
why this cannot happen?
Darkness does not fall
by closing your eyes
in front of the sun.
Do you think
that both of them
doesn't know
that I'm alive?
Are you not curious to know
that in a short span of time
the marriage has been announced?
That's because they know
that I am alive.
Both of them knew
that I will definitely
come to meet you
and expose their truth.
By which, their
conspiracy will be thwarted.
Forgive me in saying this,
King Seleucus..
Whatever step you take,
is been done of their behest.
No doubt, that you
make the move
but they are the ones
who lay the trap.
There was a time, where
you had tried to kill me
but believe me, King Seleucus..
I still have the courage
to meet you in person.
Take this
and assault me.
I am ready to die.
King Seleucus,
I am standing in front you.
Go ahead
and decapitate me
but the time for you
to know and understand
that who are your
true well-wishers
and who are your enemies.
Even when we had met
for the last time
Chandragupta and I
were trying to tell you
that we are your well-wishers.
'Dhananand is only interested
only is increasing his power'
'dominate and expand
his empire.'
'That day is not far away'
'when he will also seize
Taxila, your region.'
'He will take that kingdom
under him.'
That time, you thought
it was right
to believe
in the words of Ambhiraj.
Today, again that same
situation has cropped up.
You have to take
a decision, King Seleucus..
As to whom you should
place your trust..
Ambhiraj or me.
Whatever decision you take
I will tell you the principle
of ruling a kingdom.
History does not
remember the king
who keeps on repeating
the mistakes.
I completely believe
that whatever decision you take
will be taken logically.
"Chanakya! Chanakya!"
- Leave us alone.
- With due respect, Princess..
I have the orders
to keep vigil all the time.
I will not leave.
I have come to meet
that person
for whom my marriage
was going to break.
For him, my future husband
would have died
in the hands of Seleucus.
If anybody tries to stop me
the consequence
will not be good.
Be careful!
Why did you tell my reality?
Joking
I was joking..
I know..
I know that mother
is safe because of you.
I am in your debt, Durdhara.
You saved her
from your
brother's trap.
I am in our debt.
And now
I am here
to get you out of here.
There is no other way, Chandra.
You have no idea
the arrangements brother made
to torture you.
Tomorrow, he is going to make
you fight most cruel
and best fighters
in the arena.
How will you be able
to fight in this condition?
You will not be able
to fight, Chandra.
The emperor will beat
every single breath out of you.
You will not be able
to put up with it.
No matter what
Dhananand does tomorrow
Chandragupta will fight.
Chandragupta is determined to make
the dream of united India come true.
As being the one who
made him walk the path
and as his teacher,
it is my duty to protect him.
So we have to continue
with our revolution.
No matter what we have to do,
We will not let Dhananand
get Paurava kingdom.
Acharya,
you tried your best
to convince Seleucus.
But it is yet to be determined
who he will side with.
With us or that Ambhiraj.
That is why
we need another plan.
A plan that will turn the favour
of fate towards us.
Pardon me, Acharya, but I cannot
see any way
to protect my son
and achieve our goal.
There is a way, Your Majesty.
If we can get Malayketu somehow,
our problems will be solved.
Your Majesty, Malayketu
is son of late King Puru!
He is the true heir of King Puru!
It is him.
If I could find him,
I will take him to the general
of Paurava army, Rudradev,
and then not only will the army
of Paurava, the entire Paurava
kingdom, each and every civilian
will stand beside us
and oppose Dhananand.
They say that subjects
will be like the king.
It means that the subjects
are like the king.
A person should not get
the right to become a king
only because he was
born in a royal family.
A person become king with his
thinking with his actions
and with his desire
to serve his subjects.
And most importantly,
with his dedication
and servitude towards
the kingdom and country.
So it is the duty of subjects
and also rights to remove
an undeserving person
sitting atop the throne
and hand over the burden
of rule to a person
who is capable of carrying it.
Only then will the future
of subjects and the king
can be secure.
The principles are mine
but the decision is yours.
I think that we should
straight away kill that youth
instead of having this duel and all.
Do not worry, Ambhiraj.
I am more eager than
you to kill him.

================================================================================

Episode: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkUPuIUlbUY

Your Highness, Malayketu
is the son of late king Puru.
If at all I find him,
I will take him
before the commander of Paurav,
Rudrasen.
But Acharya, finding
the king Puru's son
is like finding the needle
between the grass.
How can you be so sure
he is at Taxila?
He can be in any part
of this country.
It is possible Ambhiraj
has killed him.
No, Mahisha!
Ambhiraj is as wicked
as Dhananand.
I have complete faith
he wouldn't have killed
Malayketu.
He would have kept him
in some secret place
so that he can use him for his
selfishness in the future.
And as per my calculations
Malayketu is definitely
in Taxila.
We have just this night.
We have to find him at any cost.
Let's spread in different
directions
but we surely have to find him.
Let us go!
What happened, lady?
I-I am not convinced.
For the sake of Chandra's safety
I will go, myself!
No, lady.
I cannot let you go
to Taxila's palace!
- It can prove dangerous for you.
- My son is also over there!
His life is at risk!
I cannot let him die
as long as I'm alive.
To free him
I will do whatever I can.
- I will go.
- Lady! Five years.
For the last five years,
I always felt
Chandra is no more!
But you..
You never accepted it.
It was your faith
that turned the truth
I witnessed into a lie.
And right now
I will not let you lose
that faith, lady.
Have faith, lady.
Nothing will go wrong
with Chandra.
You.. Mark my words!
Tomorrow the king of Magadha
will witness Chandra rising
and not the sunrise.
Chandragupta, heed my words.
The emperor will
torture you.
You will not be able to tolerate
the pain.
That's why..
That's why
drink this poison.
That is the only way left.
Only this can save us
from the pain.
Ambhiraj, Seleucus, the emperor
have all united.
They are very powerful.
You are all alone.
How will you face them?
They will torture you.
They will harm you.
And at the end..
They will kill you at the end.
Think about Acharya Chanakya,
Queen Mura and Stul
who cannot see you
in such a condition.
They will be hurt
by your horrifying death.
Drink this poison
for their sake.
I know they will never forgive me
for having given you
such an advice.
But this is still better
than the death
that is awaiting you tomorrow.
Forgive me for all the
trouble I have given you.
The option you are giving me
is not acceptable to me.
I am not among those
who abscond like a coward
in a difficult situation
the snob princess.
I have challenged
every difficulty in life
by facing them bravely.
I have ended them.
I am Chandragupta.
Queen Mura
and king Chandravardhan's son!
I am a warrior and not a coward.
You..
Durdhara
death is definite for all.
But life..
Not everyone
is blessed with life.
A life that's honourable
even when the death
is approaching.
Such a life
which even
death feels proud of.
No matter what happens tomorrow
I am ready.
But I
will never accept defeat.
I will fight.
I will fight till my last breath.
I will not
let give up on my
dream of seeing India free.
I will not back out
from the promise
I have made to my acharya.
I am a warrior.
It is my destiny to fight.
And it is also my policy.
Even now, I think
that we should straight away
kill that youth instead
of having this duel and all.
Do not worry, Ambhiraj.
I am more eager than
you to kill him.
But before killing him
we will have
to destroy his ideologies.
When he will die
in front of the subjects
of the Puru Kingdom
and that of Taxila
the hopes of all
those people who believe in him
will also die.
We searched everywhere
the whole night.
But we failed to find
Malayketu anywhere.
According to me, we should
start working on our plan
to get Chandragupta released.
Have patience,
Your Highness.
Everything is going to be fine.
All three of you head to
the auditorium right away.
And the rest of us will continue
our search for Malayketu.
Do not worry,
Your Highness.
I promise you, I will not
let Chandragupta to fail.
And also will not let that
Dhananand to win.
Today, not only
the pact will be breached
but also Durdhara's wedding
will be called off.
'Irrespective of what
happens tomorrow'
'I will fight.'
'I will fight till my last breath.'
Princess, today we will be starting
a new life as husband and wife.
We will make a new beginning
with the end of our enemy.
On this auspicious
occasion
I want to give my beautiful
wife a beautiful gift.
'I am accepting this
gift with the hope'
'that you will free
yourself from those shackles'
'and will free me from this
fake relationship very soon'
'and take
me away from here.'
I wanted to have the pleasure of
killing you last night itself.
But you are still alive
only because of Dhananand.
You are very fond of showing
off your valour your might, right?
So, I, too, will see now
that how you are going
to save yourself.
You had stolen this dagger
to frame Ambikumar, right?
The wounds caused by this
dagger is going to cause
you immense pain and will
give you a slow painful death.
You are going to die
here, now!
Guards,
take him away.
According to me,
we should contact those people
who take
care of orphans.
Perhaps, someone who
take care of orphans
might have found Malayketu
before he met Ambhiraj.
We will resume our search.
And will meet at the port near
Jhelum River after three hours.
- Chandra..
- No..
The citizens of Taxila
and Paurav kingdom.
You all might be thinking why you
all have been invited here.
This soldier is the reason for it.
He has told us his identity.
Only he knows if it is true or not.
But we all know a truth about him.
The truth is that he is a traitor.
His crime is..
that he tried to
kill my best friend, Seleucus.
He also tried to kill
my sister's
to-be husband and
your prince, Ambikumar.
Today
you shall see him die.
You will all see what happens
when someone
goes against Magadha
and Taxila.
'Dhananand and Ambhiraj
are conspiring against you.'
'If you want to do something
against them'
'you have time only
till tomorrow.'
'Once this wedding
takes place'
'and Dhananand gets
Paurav kingdom in his grip'
'then that day will not be far when you'
'will have to return to Macedonia.'
Everyone will remember
today's battle forever.
Because the most intimidating
and powerful
warriors of Taxila would
come here today.
There is just one rule.
Kill others or die.
I will take him
to his end myself.
You will definitely die.
But sooner you tell
the truth about yourself
the easier your death will be.
Otherwise
I will torture you
till your last breath.
If you do not want that
to happen
tell the truth about yourself
to everyone over here.
Tell me your real identity.
Go
and sit in your place.
Get ready for an amazing battle.
You would have never seen
what you will see today.
Do and enjoy this, Dhananand.
I am ready.
The fire would be hotter
if I add more sticks to it.
If we use this example in our lives
there are people in our lives
who make us angry
for their own selfish needs.
They use their words to upset us.
When we suffer because of our anger
those people feel happy.
You must be aware
of such people
who would make
you feel negative.
Our anger can be bad
not only to us
but also to people around us.
The principles are mine
the destiny is yours.

No, I cannot see
my son dying.
- I am going to save Chandra.
- No, Lady Mura.
This is the time to fight
and not to surrender
yourself.
If anybody here
can encourage Chandra to fight
it is only you, Lady Mura.
- Mother.
- Chandra.
'Son, always remember
that you are the Chandra'
'who has to drive away'
the darkness in India'
'and rise as a new light.'
'Always remember
who you are'
'where your identity
is connected to'
'and whose blood is flowing
in your veins.'
Your Majesty.
Your Majesty.
Your Majesty.
Your Majesty.
Our struggle will soon
yield results, Chandragupta.
Your Majesty.
Your Majesty.
Your Majesty.
Your Majesty.
Dhananand,
you had organised this war
to find out my identity, right?
You wanted to
how I am, right?
I am the same person
whom you tried
to kill many times.
But I failed
all your attempts
and stood firm to fight
for my motherland
and I will always do so
till I do not
destroy you,
Dhananand.
Yes, I am your death.
Chandragupta Maurya!
This..
This is what I wanted
to hear from your mouth
that who you are
so that I can complete
the chapter
that was left incomplete
five years ago.
Kill him!
'Dhananand and Ambhiraj
are together against you'
'in this plan.'
'And if you want to do
anything against them'
'you have time
only till tomorrow'
'because once
this wedding takes place'
'and Paurava Dynasty comes
under the rule of Dhananand'
'the day will not be
very far'
'when you will have
to return to Macedonia.'
What does this imply,
Seleucus?
What are you proving
by supporting my biggest enemy?
That I have found out
who my real enemy is.
Yes, Dhananand.
I am doing all this because
I have found out the truth.
And if you even touch
Chandragupta
it will be equivalent to
going against me, Dhananand.
Enough. Stop it!
He will definitely die
at my hands.
Ambhiraj,
I had warned you last night
not to keep me alive.
Otherwise, I will not
keep you alive.
Father!
Father.
Father.
I am here, Father.
I will not let anything
happen to you.
Father.
Father.
Kill this traitor.
Attack!
Run.
Run.
I will not let my son
die here at any cost.
Let us go.
- Amatya.
- Yes, Your Majesty.
The Takshashila army
is taking their king's revenge.
So, will Magadha's army
not take their king's revenge?
Call our soldiers
and tell them
to join this battle.
As you say, Your Majesty.
Magadha's Army, kill Chandragupta.
Sister. Do you see it?
It is impossible
for Chandragupta to survive.
On one end, stands
the mighty Magadha soldiers
and on the other end
facing them,
is this little man.
The swords of the soldiers
will cut his flesh and bones.
And with that
his ideas
his existence
and India's dream
will come to an end.
Attack him!
Chandra!
My King.
That is a 'Macedonian' spear.
Seleucus!
At last Chanakya talked Seleucus
into favoring us.
This is all because
of Seleucus.
That traitor
has made a huge mistake.
Dhananand,
did you really think
that I would quietly
await my death?
That I would celebrate
your friendship with Ambhiraj
so you could throw me
out from the country?
What are you saying,
Seleucus!
My father had always
been your ally.
You better stay quiet.
You are just a pawn
in Dhananand's grand scheme.
By getting his sister
to marry you
he dream
of controlling 'Takshashila'.
He thought he would
capture all the western routes
that passes through
the 'Jhelum' river.
So that he could not only
capture 'India'
but also my westerns kingdoms.
But I am a king.
The one who always plan
two steps ahead.
And as far as father
is concerned.
He got a fitting death.
And now the same fate
awaits you and Dhananand.
Seleucus!
Mind your tongue!
You made a big mistake
by accusing
my father's loyalty
and respect.
And you will definitely
pay for that!
As far as I remember
last time you needed my help to fight
with not so trained soldiers.
And today
your life is at my mercy.
So think twice before you
take your next decision.
Good decision.
Chandragupta, Seleucus
both of you are forgetting
that Paurav Kingdom's
army commander, Rudradev
is duty-bound to me.
And a Kshatriya does not
break his promise
even if he has to die
in the process.
The whole army of Paurav Kingdom
is dutiful to me.
Rudradev, come here
with your army.
Rudradev,
I am very happy
with your loyalty towards me.
You have proved
that a Kshatriya never
breaks his promise.
Never.
Now, with your army
and Magadha and Taxila's army
end Macedonia's army.
Teach them what it
means to betray me.
Kill them all!
'To wash away this stain
from this dirty cloth'
'I have to soak it
in water for some time.'
'And then I have to rinse it
thoroughly may times.'
'Only after this tireless
and continuous effort'
'will this stain go away.'
'Similarly, sometimes our
relationships get stained'
'by bitterness and resentment.'
'And to remove this stain,
we need tireless'
'and continuous effort.
If we do not put in the efforts'
'that stain does not go away.'
'And like a dirty cloth,
you have to discard'
'that relationship'
'which is not in
your best interest.'
'My principles, your destiny.'
I will carry out my promise
and principles as well.

================================================================================

Episode: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b3SjiyOzmlw

Rudradev.
You have proved yourself
that a Kshatriya
never breaks his promise.
Never!
Take your soldiers
along with the soldiers
of Taxila and
Magadha, and teach them a lesson
that the consequence
one faces for betraying me.
Give them death!
You are right, Emperor.
I am bound by the oath.
With loyalty and till
my last breath, I will fight
for the King of Pauravas.
I will carry out my promise
and principles as well.
Wonderful!
Mahamatya.
Only a warrior
will become the reason
for the death
of another warrior prince.
Imbecile! Sinner!
You're nothing
but a betrayer, warrior!
You had said
you are duty bound
towards the emperor.
You had said, you can lay down
your life for the emperor.
Liar! You lied!
Even you are a rebel.
No, Dhananand!
A warrior never
shuns his duty!
My profound respect and loyalty
has always been towards
the throne of the empire.
But my loyalty is towards
a true emperor
which you are not,
Dhananand!
The true emperor
is the prince of the Pauravas..
Malayketu!
Darn!
This is utter nonsense!
There is no prince
of the Pauravas.
He had died years back.
The prince of the Pauravas is alive.
Look, Dhananand.
Look carefully.
The euphoria which you
were divulging
for the last five years
in the death of five people..
Those five people are standing
right in front of you..
They're standing tall,
full of courage
and alive.
Destiny has made us
stand together again.
What we had started
five years back
today, we will make sure
to bring an end to it.
Get ready for your first
defeat, Dhananand!
I had already warned you
that Chandragupta and I
will never let the Paurav
kingdom come under you.
Listen one! Listen all!
The time has come
that the throne
of the Paurav kingdom
will be taken
by the honourable successor
and the true legacy.
This announcement
is not only for you, Dhananand.
It is for the entire world!
The true successor to the throne
of the Paurav kingdom..
The son of King Puru..
He is alive!
The Paurav hierarchy
has not come to an end.
So, posthumously
I would
like to present
the son of King Puru..
The true successor
to the throne of this kingdom..
Prince Malayketu!
What are you trying to say?
You must be mistaken.
Acharya, I have spent my
entire life in that dark shanty.
If I am free then
that is only because of
you and Chandra.
And I did not have the courage
to come out of that place.
So, how can I become
the strong and able
prince of the Paurav kingdom?
How can I be the descendant
of the King of Puru, Acharya?
You.. You are the one.
Maybe you all might
not believe in what I said.
So,
to prove this truth
I am going
to call such a person
whose words
were no less than God
for the
mighty King Puru!
The royal priest
of the kingdom of Paurav..
Being the royal priest
of the kingdom of Paurav
I had taken
Prince Malayketu
in my arms
when he was a child.
Then I saw that Prince Malayketu
has a birth mark
on his left shoulder.
I have been told
that the same birth mark
is on your shoulder, too.
- Acharya.
- Prince..
Show the entire world
your birth mark.
Dhananand, look closely.
After Prince Malayketu was lost
we tried our best to find him.
But we met failure
in our every attempt.
But now we have found the real heir
of Paurav kingdom.
Congratulations!
Congratulations,
citizens of Paurav.
Really, all of you are
very fortunate.
You have found your prince
again after many years.
A prince who has spent
his life in a deep pit.
He had no contact
with the outside world.
A true ruler.
But how will you lead
your armies, child?
Like ants?
The same ants whose discarded
food you ate till now.
Yes, tell me.
A person becomes king by
his thinking and his actions.
Despite being a prince,
I lived the life of a slave.
But look, now I stand before
you like a warrior.
I am ready for battle and eager to
remove you from your throne.
Do not forget, Dhananand,
a king does not chose his throne
a throne choses it's king.
And today, the throne of Paurav
kingdom has chosen its ruler.
And it is not you.
It is
Malayketu!
Malayketu, you might have
spent your life in a pit
and you surely do not have
a personal identity yet.
But now you have.
From this moment
you are not just
the heir of Paurav
but also its ray of hope.
The people who lost their
dear king and your father
King Puru years ago..
You are their hope now.
You have to fight for them.
You have to fight for your father
great king Purushotam's honour
who fought for his motherland
till his last breath.
You have to fight for him, Malayketu.
I, Chandragupta Maurya,
Prince of Piplivan
son of
King Chandravardhan
with Queen
Mura as my witness
declare
you the true heir
of Paurav
kingdom's throne.
Citizens of Paurav,
till now I spent my life
in that dark pit.
But today I have got the chance to
lead Paurav kingdom out of darkness.
For that, I promise to fight
till my last breath.
And if you have faith in me,
then pick up your weapons
and fight with me.
Fight for your motherland.
- Hail Bharat!
- Hail Bharat!
Hail Bharat! Hail Bharat!
- Attack!
- Attack!
Attack!
Your Highness,
time does not favour us.
I think we should go back.
No, Amatya
I will not go back without
killing Chandragupta.
Today he will die definitely.
Your Majesty, please listen to me.
Sister, I need you.
Give your sword to me.
I will forgive all your
betrayals and slights.
Just give me once chance at life.
Give it to me, Sister.
Look, your brother is begging to you.
You know I have always
loved you unselfishly.
'Light of my life, my dear, beloved
sister you are welcome.'
'Only one person has the right
to sit beside me in Magadha'
'and that is my dear sister,
Durdhara.'
Give it to me, Sister.
Chandragupta!
Your Majesty,
go from here.
It can be dangerous
to stay here even for a second.
There is a lot of risk here,
Your Majesty.
We have lost the war.
Come with me.
No, Amatya.
Before that, I will ensure that
this traitor comes behind me
because if he follows me
I will put an end
to this chapter forever.
But how will you do that?
Through my dearest sister.
Soldiers, form
a safety circle for the king.
Immediately!
Come.
- Come with me.
- No.
Let us go.
No. Leave me.
I said, I do not want
to go with you.
Leave me.
Leave me.
Chandragupta!
Chandra.
Chandra.
Chandra.
Get up, Chandra.
Dhananand is taking Durdhara.
You will have to save her. Get up.
Your Majesty, look at that.
Amatya, destroy
his name too.
He is injured badly.
He will not be able
to fight for long.
As you wish, Your Majesty.
Your orders will be followed.
You are making
a big mistake, Chandragupta.
You are taking
an alive weapon with you.
How did you forget
that the same blood as mine
flows in my sister's veins too?
Do you know
who had helped me
when you had made me
weaponless?
This.
You know my sister very well.
You must be knowing
her dagger too.
Yes, Chandragupta.
My sister
had helped me.
Do you know why?
Because my sister
may be angry with me.
She may not follow
my orders.
But she can never betray me.
Chandragupta, you will have to pay a
huge price for taking Durdhara along.
Remember one thing.
Blood calls blood.
Dhananand, I can kill you
right now if I want to.
But this will be
an easy death for you.
You will be punished
for your misdeeds
at the right time.
Do not worry.
I will free
Princess Durdhara
from the clutches
of Chandragupta very soon.
I know.
People of Taxila
always attack from behind.
Your father, Ambhiraj
attacked
from behind King Puru.
Now, you were trying
to do the same.
But as long as
Rudradev is alive
you can never succeed
in doing so.
You will have to pay
a price for this mistake
by sacrificing your life.
Soldiers, step back.
Hail Prince Malayketu.
Hail Prince Malayketu.
Hail Prince Malayketu.
'My sister helped me.'
'My sister might be
upset with me.'
'She might disobey me.'
'But she can never deceive me.'
I knew that you will definitely
come for me, Chandra.
I made a big mistake
by coming here.
What!
I am going,
Princess Durdhara.
No.
Chandragupta,
you cannot leave me.
But I have already
made up my mind.
Henceforth,
our paths are different.
But why?
Because I do not trust
you anymore, Durdhara.
Chandra..
I know
it will take time
for me to regain your trust.
But you
cannot leave me.
Chandra!
Chandra!
Amatya Rakshas, I know him
and my sister very well.
Sister, come.
It is the time to return home.
Queen Mura..
Do you know?
It is a joyous day today.
Today, we have achieved
the biggest win.
First, Ambhiraj has been killed.
And Malayketu has
become the new king
of Paurav Kingdom.
Dhananand's dream
of acquiring Paurav Kingdom
has been shattered completely.
Not only that..
Not only Dhananand has
lost the war today
but also become a fugitive.
He has fled
to Magadha
to save his life.
Stulbhadra.
What are you doing?
If you celebrate your
victory before the right time
they you will have to mourn
over your defeat later.
Acharya, are you
not aware of this?
Today, we have
achieved the biggest win.
Today, we have made
Dhananand bite the dust.
Even I will chant today.
Hail Chandragupta!
- Hail Malayketu!
- Stulbhadra!
There is no harm
in getting excited.
But over excitement
can land you in trouble.
Have you heard this, Acharya.
I am not the only one
who is celebrating.
The entire Paurav Kingdom
is celebrating today.
That was not just
a shout of victory
but also of celebration
and happiness.
Queen Mura, I do not know
why I am feeling
as if this celebration is the
indication of our upcoming trouble.
I have to go and stop
this right away.
Hail Paurav Kingdom!
Hail Paurav Kingdom!
Hail Paurav Kingdom!
The residents of Paurav Kingdom,
it is a joyous day today.
Come on. Let us celebrate this
occasion in a grand manner.
Because not only we
have regained
our pride today
but also get back
our lost prince
the true successor
of Paurav Kingdom
the heir of King Puru
Prince Malayketu.
Hail Prince Malayketu!
Hail Prince Malayketu!
Emperor, if you do not
like their celebration
- I will stop it right away.
- No, Philip.
Every issue needs to be dealt
in a different manner.
Look at them.
Did ever see the residents
of Paurav Kingdom
- united like this before?
- No, Your Highness.
There is no doubt about it.
I am seeing them
celebrating together for the first time.
Hence, I need to take part in their
celebration in a different manner.
Just wait and watch
how I will give them a big gift.
Before Seleucus does something
bad, I have to stop him!
Wonderful!
His Majesty Seleucus is here to take
part in celebration of our victory.
Welcome, Your Majesty.
Congratulations, Your Majesty.
We have defeated
that Dhananand today!
We forced him to flee
the battlefield.
He who occupied
all the states of India
was made to taste defeat by us!
This day will be written
in golden letters
in the history of Paurav!
Congratulations, Your Majesty..
You have undoubtedly made a huge
contribution to today's victory
General of Paurav Army,
Rudradev.
And you deserve a reward.
We fight bravely and
do not take victory in alms.
Don't forget that I still
rule Takshshila and Paurava state.
Here even a bird flies
with my permission.
Even you should have
taken my permission
before supporting someone in battle.
You forgot that in my rule I do
not like anyone's interference.
And this is punishment for that,
Rudradev.
So Dhananand took Durdhara.
Yes, he took her.
How many more time are you
going ask me that, Acharya?
How many more times do I have
to tell you that Dhananand
took Durdhara.
Just one more time.
Was it Dhananand
who took Durdhara?
Look into my eyes and tell me..
Did Dhananand take Durdhara?
I knew it!
I knew it, Your Majesty,
that he is lying.
The Chandragupta I know would
not have allowed Dhananand
to take Durdhara,
who was under his protection.
He let her go deliberately.
Yes, Acharya,
I left her deliberately.
Why, though?
It is because many people
on our side have lost
their lives because
of her betrayal.
And I do not want any sort
of risk in the future.
So I abandoned her.
No, Chandra.
What you did is wrong.
Even you know that without
Durdhara's help, bringing
Dhananand out of Taxila
was impossible.
When you brought Durdhara
here for the first time
I told you that trust me,
my trust and my ability
to make decisions
and not Durdhara.
- But, Acharya..
- But you did not!
When I saw her, I knew she
is not the person she was.
Time and circumstances had
brought a stability to her character.
She knew the difference
between right and wrong.
But you let her go
with Dhananand!
Acharya is right.
Durdhara had helped us
and now you have put her under
even more trouble, Chandra.
We have to save Durdhara.
Dhananand is not
going to spare her.
He might kill
Durdhara under rage.
Do you know that a lion always
licks his wounds after defeats.
By doing that, he is not
only seeing to his wounds
but also
reminds himself
self-reflects
over his errors
and things he has work on
so that he would not repeat
his mistake in the next fight.
We have to adopt
this principle in our life.
Do not prepare
for another attack right
after a defeat.
Take your time,
scrutinise yourself
think on the details
which
resulted in your defeat.
Only then will you prevent yourself
from making the same mistake
and get victory in your next fight.
The principles are mine
but the decision is yours.
I had only two options..
Apology or death.
You declined to apologise
so get ready to face death, Durdhara.

================================================================================

Episode: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4CDPkoBH-Q

Durdhara had helped us.
Now, you have put her
in more trouble, Chandra.
We will have to save Durdhara
because Dhananand
will not spare her now.
I hope he does not kill
Durdhara in anger.
'I knew that you would
surely come for me, Chandra.'
'I made a big mistake
by coming here.'
'Chandragupta,
you cannot leave me and go.'
'Our paths are different
from today'
'because I do not
trust you anymore, Durdhara.'
Princess.
Are you all right?
Yes, I am all right.
Alert!
King of Magadha,
Dhananand, is arriving.
I have come here
to share our grief.
I am mourning
the death of my respect.
And you..
You are mourning
for somebody
who was never yours.
The grief of
Chandragupta's trust.
The grief of his love
which is just an illusion in reality.
I have not completed
my talk yet.
Will you do me a favour, Sister?
Apply this on my face.
What is this?
Black colour.
Durdhara, nobody could be as
eager as you to paint my face black.
I was humiliated
in front of others
in Taxila
because of you.
So, why do I not let
my dearest sister
to insult me?
Hurry up.
Apply this black colour.
What happened?
Will you not fulfil
this small wish of mine?
Okay.
I have been blamed.
So, let me apply this black colour
on my face with my own hands.
Okay?
Look at this.
Look at me.
Am I looking
as you had imagined?
Look at me, Sister.
Is it less?
Okay, here you go.
Look at this.
Here you go.
Look at me.
Look at me!
This is what you wanted,
right?
Black colour
on your brother's face.
You have got
to witness this amazing sight.
Tell me.
Accept it.
This is the day that
you were waiting for, right?
Tell me, Durdhara.
No, I did not want this
to happen
because this is
not sufficient.
I will not forgive you
for your misdeeds
just because you have applied
black colour on your face.
Because of you
many innocent people
have lost their lives
for your satisfaction
and greed.
Their blood will not
be washed by this black colour.
Neither my father's blood
nor my brother,
Govishankar's blood.
The sins that you have
committed in your life
will not be washed away
by this black colour.
So, go and pretend
in front of others.
You deserve a bigger
punishment than this.
You need not tell me what I deserve
and what I do not.
But I will tell you today
what you deserve.
Come with me.
The sun many rise
from the west
but Dhananand cannot harm
his dearest sister.
More than himself
he has only loved
his sister in this world.
She is the only hope
in his dark life.
And his emotions are true
only towards his sister.
Chandragupta!
Nobody knows it
better than you
than when Dhananand
punishes anybody
he makes that person's life
so miserable
that he would prefer to die.
Why should Durdhara tolerate
Dhananand's anger in order to help us?
This would be injustice
towards her.
I agree with
Queen Mura, Chandragupta.
Durdhara is not our enemy.
You have made a mistake
by letting her go with Dhananand.
Chandragupta, it is not wrong
if a human being makes mistakes.
But it is wrong
not to do anything
even after realising
your mistake.
I just want you to bring
Durdhara safely to us
whenever you realise
your mistake.
I am only scared
that I hope Dhananand
does not cause
a major harm to Durdhara
which would put her life in danger
by the time
you realise your mistake.
Your Majesty.
Your Majesty,
please have mercy.
Do not punish the princess.
I apologise on her behalf.
Leave her.
Move aside.
Otherwise, I will send you
to your dead mother and brother.
Move aside.
My Lord, she is your
dearest sister.
You didn't shower your
affection to anybody
else apart from her,
in the entire world.
So, I request you to
forget it and calm down.
No, Amatya.
She has misused my affection.
Magadha cannot be
so much biased to anybody
no matter even if it is
my dearest sister.
My Lord, please listen
to me.
Today, for the first time
in my life, I tasted defeat
because of you.
I had to turn my back to the
enemy and escape.
I am the
emperor of Magadha
the one who
is respected a lot.
I had to bow down, because of you.
My enemies
are celebrating
and making
fun of me today.
You are the reason for it.
Apologise to me.
Apologise to your brother.
The one who loved
you more than himself.
The one who did everything for you.
Apologise!
I will not apologise
for
anything that I have done.
I had only two options..
Apology
or death.
You declined to
apologise
so get ready to
face death, Durdhara.
Princess!
I did all this
to make you realise
that had it been
anybody else in your place
what would
have been his fate.
But you
are not anybody
you are
my dearest sister.
I love you a lot.
I cannot kill you.
Why did you do so?
Why did you join hands
with the enemies?
What did you gain by
killing our father?
I only did what you deserve.
You killed our father for the
sake of power and kingdom.
You lied to me.
You hid the truth.
For years, I was
under the impression
that our father died
suddenly.
You
continued to lie to me.
Only for your selfishness.
If I am supposed to receive
this punishment
according to such a person.
Then go ahead and kill me.
Nobody is stopping you.
Punish me the way
I deserve to be.
Durdhara!
When a dictator dies
his rule ends with his death.
But when a warrior
attains martyrdom
a new chapter begins.
Rudradev, the deceased
commander of Paurav kingdom
was one such warrior.
We have to ensure that
his sacrifice was not in vain.
Rudradev will always remain
afresh in our memories
for his attempts and
courage and inspire us
to turn his dream of freedom
into reality.
To keep the flame of freedom
always burning.
Salute to such a
great warrior.
No, Malay.
Wipe your tears.
Every end leads to a new
beginning.
Rudradev wanted
to
see the true heir on the throne
of Paurav kingdom before his death.
S-Soon you will be the
emperor of
Paurav kingdom, Malay.
I won't let anything go
wrong with you.
You will be fine, Durdhara.
Royal healer!
My sister should service,
royal healer.
Do whatever is required
to do so.
Hope you understand.
Save my sister.
Get the medicines.
You will be fine, Sister.
You will be fine.
What are you doing here?
Royal Physician order him to bring some
medicine and save my sister's life.
Immediately!
Remember, if my sister dies
I will kill all of you!
Your Majesty,
they are trying their best.
Be assured, nothing will
happen to the princess.
Stop consoling me, Amatya.
Whenever you assure me of something,
it always goes wrong.
I..
I will inspect
the medicine myself
for my sister's treatment,
so that there is no..
Blood?
My hands are stained
with my dear sister's blood!
No. No!
No..
No. No..
No.. Remove it.
Why is this bloodstain
not going away?
I cannot stand this!
What is the next stage
of our plan, Acharya?
The world bows to those, Chandragupta,
who do not wait for
the situation to change
but rather create it themselves.
Our plan is still the same,
freeing our motherland
from cruel rulers like
Dhananand and Seleucus.
It is true that Seleucus helped
us in reaching here
and saving Paurav kingdom
from Dhananand
but an even bigger truth is
that this greedy foreigner
is the enemy of our motherland.
That is why we have to chase
him away from here.
And he has to be punished
for killing Rudradev.
Seleucus has to leave India.
We fight bravely and
do not take victory in alms.
Don't forget that I still
rule Takshshila and Paurava state.
Here even a bird flies
with my permission.
Your Highness,
should we have helped
Chandragupta and Chanakya?
Ambhiraj is dead.
And Ambikumar has
run away from Taxila.
Can we trust them?
Alexander used to say,
if you trust someone blindly
then one day that person
will blind you in truth.
That is why I do not
even trust trust itself.
The best shield a king
can wield is suspicion.
And I have always been
suspicious of everyone.
Be it Dhananand, Ambhiraj,
Chandragupta or Chanakya.
Or you!
Chandragupta and Chanakya used me
to chase Dhananand away.
Now you will see how I conquer
not just Magadha but the whole India
using their own plan.
And I will destroy Dhananand!
Why is this blood
not washing away?
No.. No!
My sister's blood
cannot be spilled like this.
Servant, stop it
from draining away.
Give it to me.
All of you are useless.
Move!
Your Majesty, come quickly.
Amatya, is my sister all right?
Say that my sister is all right.
My sister had to be all right.
Amatya, why are you not saying
that my sister has gotten better?
Come see yourself, Your Majesty.
Durdhara!
The princess is no more,
Your Majesty!
The next sunrise will
bring light to the whole world
but it will bring darkness to Magadha.
Malayketu.
I can understand
what is going on in your mind.
You are angry
and you want revenge.
But we cannot make a wrong
move out of anger.
Seleucus will get punished
for this heinous crime.
But we have to do everything
with proper planning.
I do not need any plan
to punish him, Acharya.
I just need a sword.
And I have it.
Malayketu, what are you doing?
I am going to kill Seleucus.
I will kill him!
You plan to kill Seleucus.
Be sensible, Malay.
He is not some
day to day miscreant
he is Seleucus Nicator,
a very powerful king.
You cannot even get close
to him, let alone kill him.
Look, Malay, no one can
understand your pain
better than me out
of everyone present here.
Dhananand took from me what
Seleucus took from you.
He killed my father.
He took my kingdom,
Piplivan, from me.
He had my mother
as a servant in his palace.
When I found out about my past,
I wanted to kill Dhananand just like you.
But then Chanakya told me
that anger does not solve problems
but complicates them more.
So calm down.
Do not see me as your
reflection, Chandragupta.
I know that you got many
chances to kill Dhananand.
But you did not kill him.
It is because you want to walk the
path of righteousness and finish him.
I am not like you.
I will take revenge against
Seleucus and kill him.
After What he did to my father,
to Rudradev and to the innocent
subjects of Paurav,
he has no right to live.
I will take that right
from him by killing him.
No one can stop
me from doing that.
Stop, Malayketu..
I want to talk to Malay.
You are right, Your Majesty.
Any problem can be solved
by discussing about them.
We should talk about this.
You seem to misunderstand.
I want to talk
only to Malay alone.
I hope our motherland is soon
rid of this foreigner, Seleucus
and that cruel Dhananand.
No, my sister cannot die.
My sister means
the world to me and Magadha.
She cannot leave me.
Royal Physician,
what medicine
have you used to treat her?
I have used the best medicines
we have available, Your Majesty.
The Yunani medicines that
were used to treat Dai Maa.
Bring me all the medicines.
Your Majesty, the princess is..
I said, get me all
the medicines right now!
I believe the medicines
have not been administered
in proper ratio.
The method used to prepare
poison is also used
to prepare medicine.
Ratio.. It is all about ratio.
I believe the medicines were
not administered to my sister
in proper ratio.
Royal Physician, give me
leaves of Malabar nut plant.
This is the right ratio for medicine.
Wake up.
Wake up, Sister.
Wake up, Durdhara!
Wake up!
You cannot
punish me like this.
I cannot carry the burden
of your death, Durdhara!
Wake up..
Wake up.
This is the king's order!
The King of Magadha's order!
No one can defy me!
Wake up!
I said no one could defy me!
Never!
My sister cannot die!
She cannot die!
She has to stay alive!
Death cannot defeat me!
- You are right.
Durdhara!
Are you all right?
My sister is fine.
Durdhara is fine!
I knew you would not
leave me alone.
I knew
that you could not die.
My sister is all right.
Why did you do this, Durdhara?
Why.. Why did you
deliberately leave my hand?
What if something
had happened to you?
I knew
that I would not die
so soon.
Do you know why?
Because I have
to stay alive
to see you being dethroned.
Before Malayketu
does something in his rage
I have to stop him.
Seleucus has already
weakened the Paurav Kingdom
by killing Rudradev.
Now, Malayketu's one
wrong step will be
akin to presenting an opportunity
to Seleucus on a silver platter.
He will use it to his advantage
and kill Malayketu.
Being the future king
of united India
you should expand the limits
of your thinking, Chandragupta.
Look at this matter
in a bigger context.
Not only Malayketu
but think about
the entire motherland.
Then you will
be able to save everyone
who is a victim
of Seleucus' atrocity.
You are right, Acharya.
Tell me, Acharya.
What will be our next step?
We have to unite
the armies
of Taxila
and the Paurav Kingdom.
We have to make them
go against Seleucus.
For that, we need
to make them see the dark future
that awaits them
under Seleucus' rule.
Once they are aware
of the upcoming danger
they will surely help us.
Once the armies
of both states are united
then it will not take us much time
to make Seleucus flee India.
But, Acharya..
How will we unite the armies of
the Paurav Kingdom and Taxila?
Every soldier of Taxila
hates Chandra.
It is because he killed
their king, Ambhiraj
and because of him their prince,
Ambikumar had to flee from his kingdom.
Due to this hatred,
why would they listen to us?
That is the specialty
of hatred, Queen Mura.
Hatred is like fire, Chandragupta.
The more you add the fuel
more it burns brighter.
It means the fire of hatred
that the Taxila's army
is harbouring for me..
We need to fan it.
Then at the right time
we have to direct
their collective hatred
towards Seleucus
and the Greeks.
Indeed, Chandra.
As the days are passing,
I am seeing you emulate me.
Yes, we will do the same.
But do remember
that we have
to turn this battle
into a personal one
for these armies
and not political.
Until they view Seleucus
as an emotional
and personal danger,
they will not be able to unite.
The same level of fear
of emotional and personal damage
will unite both the armies.
Acharya, we have Malayketu
to bring the army
of the Paurav Kingdom
to our side.
But we will need a trustworthy
person from Taxila too.
Perhaps, I know
that who from Taxila can help us.
You are prideful
towards Magadha
and your throne,
are you not?
I know that one day
your pride
will be shattered.
I truly believe
that all the efforts
that you put in to become a capable
and great king
will be ruined.
You.. Like a mendicant
you will
give up your kingdom.
I completely believe
that day will soon come to be.
Forgive me, Your Highness.
Taxila's prince, Ambikumar,
wants to meet you.
She is the one who will
help us on behalf of Taxila.
Her name is Ambika.
She is the daughter of Vimaldev
the commander of Taxila.
Five years ago, she helped
me get recruited in the army.
Stulbhadra told me that you want
to make King Seleucus flee
our country with the help
of the combined forces
of Taxila
and the Paurav Kingdom.
I am aware and influenced
by Acharya Chanakya's dream
of united India.
I am ready
to help you with this plan.
But there is something
you should know.
My father is loyal
to King Seleucus.
It will be difficult to make him
and the army of Taxila
fight against King Seleucus.
Your father
and the army of Taxila
will definitely stand
against Seleucus.
They just need
the right reason.
Along with this reason
we need the armies of Greece, Taxila
and the Paurav Kingdom
and the presence of Seleucus.
And that too,
on the same day and place.
How can this be possible?
Is there any ceremony
where all of them
can gather together?
Malayketu's coronation.
Moreover, it will happen today.
But, Acharya
Seleucus has taken
Malayketu along with him.
Yes, Acharya.
By killing Rudradev,
he has made it clear
that he
does not like it when things
do not go
according to his wishes.
He has made it clear
that there is only one king
of this state.
Seleucus.
Now, in these conditions
how will we crown Malayketu?
It will happen, Stulbhadra.
If Acharya has said so
then Malayketu
will be crowned today.
Moreover,
Seleucus will announce it.
I will go and make sure
that Seleucus decides the same
as what we want.
If everything goes
according to the plan
then tomorrow's morning
will bring a ray of hope
against the darkness
of the atrocities
inflicted by Seleucus.
[sanskrit shlok]
It means
a king is worshipped
only in his kingdom.
But a teacher is worshipped
by the entire world.
That is why
to run a kingdom smoothly
having a great king
is not sufficient.
A great and scholarly teacher
is also needed
to advise the king
in the time of need.
Do remember
that even the king
bows down to the scholar.
My ethics..
Your destiny.
Coronation of Prince Malayketu
will be that memorable incident
in the life of that Seleucus
which he will never forget.

================================================================================

Episode: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TAkwW1fMB3o

Do you know
I have had bitter experiences
in Taxila?
My sister betrayed me.
Seleucus betrayed me.
After reaching there,
I got the news
that my two worst enemies
Chanakya and Chandragupta
are alive.
Along with some
of their companions
they got me expelled
from Taxila.
But you know what was the most
impressing thing
in this sequence of events?
That my sister rejected you
and propelled you
out of her life!
And you grabbed
this happiness from me.
Do you know
why you are still alive?
That's because you are
Ambhiraj's son.
But now that Ambhiraj
is no more
there is no use
of you being alive.
Especially,
not under my shelter.
Forgive me, Emperor!
Forgive me.
Have some mercy over me.
D-Do not kill me..
Move!
There is no ego left in me.
There's no self-respect left in me.
If..
If you let me live
under your shelter
perhaps, I may be
of some help to you.
- You want to live?
- Yes..
You will
owe your each breath
to me from now on.
Hereafter you have to
do as I say.
Fine.
Fine, Your Majesty.
Yes. I killed your father, Purus.
But there's no companion
in the world of politics.
In the game of politics
at times, we have to do things
that we don't wish to.
For example
Rudradev got killed
because I wanted to
strengthen my side
in this game of power.
I wanted to have control
over the governance and politics.
That's the reason
poor Rudradev got killed.
You are new to this game.
That's why, I thought
I should present before you
a strong example
in the game of politics.
So, do not develop
any hatred towards me
for whatever happened.
You can consider this
as your lesson.
In fact, you should be
thanking me.
So, tell me, what shall I
present before you?
What drink would you prefer?
Had you been a grown up
I would have offered you
a very rare drink.
But I am sorry
that you cannot savour
this rare drink.
Hey!
Shah, wait!
Shah, what are you doing?
This person with low status
tried to attack me from behind.
What?
Then he should be worth killing.
A foolish king who tries to kill you
is not capable to
be king of Paurava state.
It is better that people of
Paurava state live without a king.
As it was living for many years.
Shah!
What are you doing?
You spared him?
Shah, kill him.
Anyway, this foolish boy
cannot hold the Paurav throne
for very long.
Shah, it's better he dies.
Kill him!
Kill him right away!
Chandragupta
a foolish boy holding the throne
will prove beneficial for me.
He is a foolish boy
just as I wanted.
So, he's the right one.
I will make this foolish boy,
the king
and gain control
over the Paurav kingdom
and its citizens.
I did not get you, Shah.
This foolish guy is a dear one
to the citizens of Paurav.
If I make him the king
the citizens who are upset
with me
for having killed Rudradev
will be on my side.
I killed their favourite
commander.
By giving them
their favourite king
I can make them on my side.
Chandragupta, thank you
for making me look
at the other side of the coin.
Undoubtedly
I am the one at profit.
'You are feeling so'
'because I and Acharya made you
feel so.'
'This is our step
towards the integrated India'
'and you are just a part
of the same, Seleucus.'
Prepare for Malay's coronation.
I want him to take the throne
by today
and be the king
of the Paurav kingdom.
Do not worry, Shah.
Everything will be fine now.
'When Ambhiraj is no more'
'then there is no point
in keeping you alive.'
'Specially, in my kingdom.'
'Pardon me, Your Highness.'
'- Pardon me.
- Get lost!'
Now, I am going to exact
revenge for all those wounds
which you and your
brother have given me.
Pardon me.
I had gone blind in anger.
Because of that, I even made
an attack on that Seleucus.
My intention was
not to put our plan in danger.
No problem, Malayketu.
An important chapter
in politics teaches us
that in every defeat
an opportunity to
win will be hidden.
We just have to
recognise that opportunity
and make use of it.
The incident when
you attacked Seleucus
is one such opportunity.
We will have to use
it to our benefit now.
Everyone, listen carefully.
During the coronation
of Malayketu
each one of us have to ensure
that the tasks assigned to us
are done in the right manner.
Chandragupta,
the game has started.
We all will have to make
our moves very carefully.
Only then we will be able to win
this battle against Seleucus.
Yes.
Now, every step we take
will be towards
accomplishing the task
of bringing together the
armies of Paurav Kingdom and Taxila.
It will compel everyone
to think and realise
that they have
to free their Motherland
from that evil Seleucus.
For the welfare of our
nation and the people
we have to free our Motherland
from foreign powers.
Coronation of Prince Malayketu
will be that memorable incident
in the life of that Seleucus
which he will never forget.
[Sanskrit shlok]
Ambika, you will have to ensure
that including your father,
all the soldiers of Taxila
will occupy the seats
which have been reserved
for Philip and Greek Soldiers.
Mother and Stul
will do the task
of serving liquor
to the Greek Soldiers.
Acharya and I will keep Seleucus
busy with the rituals of
Malayketu's coronation ceremony.
Calm..
Calm down, Princess.
Calm down.
I have come here only to
check if you are fine.
'Now, listen carefully
what you have to do.'
'I know that after whatever
my sister has done to you'
'you do not have any love for her.'
'You have nothing
but hatred for her.'
'I want you to forget that
hatred right from this moment.'
'Right from this moment,
try to win her trust.'
'Convince her that
despite her betrayal'
'you still love her deeply.'
'You should not have any ill
feelings for her in your heart.'
'Did you understand?'
'Go and win
Durdhara's trust now.'
'So that I can use her as
a weapon against Chandragupta'
'at the right time.'
'Did you understand?'
'Yes.Yes.'
Princess, I had not come
here to disturb your sleep.
My concern for you
compelled me to come here.
After whatever
had happened last night
I thought of
checking on you once.
You take rest.
I will come later.
Come, Father.
Bear this in mind.
This liquor is meant only
for the Greek Soldiers.
'Your fall is near Seleucus Nicator.'
[Sanskrit shlok]
[Sanskrit shlok]
This is not right.
In this auspicious coronation
why are they
serving alcohol?
Forgive me..
I thought the Greek
soldiers are sitting here.
Excuse me.
You are the queen
of Piplivan, right?
There was a time
I used to be a queen.
Maybe it is in my destiny
to languish as a handmaiden.
These Greeks want a queen
to serve alcohol to them.
I tried explaining them
that a royal coronation
is an auspicious affair
and drinking alcohol
in such a sacred function
is like blasphemy and our
Indian culture will be insulted
but they..
Pardon me! Pardon me!
I said too much
as I got carried away.
I know that you are loyal to King
Seleucus and the Greek army.
I should not have spoken
about this.
If I have offended you
with my words
then, please pardon me.
King, I am happy that whatever
differences we had between us
have come to an end.
Why are these stupid soldiers of Taxila
are being given special preference?
Maybe we should show them
where they really belong.
Such audacity that you
have taken our places!
Maybe you forgot
where you all belong.
Remove these cheap
soldiers from our seats!
Chandragupta, look
what is happening there.
Go and bring
the situation under control.
This place is only
for the Greek soldiers.
You belong there,
not there.
Being from Taxila,
you will not mend your ways.
As the saying goes
in your region..
- A tale of a dog will never
straighten out. - Enough!
Dare you cross your limit!
Please calm down.
Everybody..
Please calm down.
Commander Philip,
please come with me.
I will give you
a special place to relax.
Right beside King Seleucus.
Please come.
This matter is not serious.
We all are one.
- Please come.
- We all are not friends!
And neither we are one..
Whether it concerns Taxila
or the Paurav kingdom.
Being the natives of this place,
your status is lower than us.
Our status and position is much
more superior than yours.
You all come under
the rule of King Seleucus.
All Indians are our slaves.
It would be good
for all of you
to accept this fact.
Philip has no control
over his anger.
He does not know
what and when to speak!
King..
Abruptly getting up
from this veneration
is considered to be
inauspicious.
You cannot get up
till the ritual ends.
Do not worry.
That is just
a minor altercation.
Chandragupta
will handle it deftly.
Please do not worry.
Enjoy the ceremony.
'Seleucus, the unison
of a united India has started.'
'That day is not far'
'when you will be wiped out
from our motherland.'
It is natural for a man
to commit mistakes
but suffering a loss
from the mistake of others
what will be your reaction?
Even that is very important.
That is because suffering
from the mistake of others
if you get angry on them
then you will not be helping
that person
in making him learn
from his mistake.
The outcome will be
when that person
again commits mistakes
in the future
then he will tend to hide
his actions.
So remember
if you are harmed
by the mistake of others
then do not take
the path of anger or aggression.
Calmly try to
solve the situation
or else, the mistake
which happened unintentionally
might also make you suffer for
being betrayed in the future.
My principles.
Your actions.
Our plan's first stage
is a complete success.
It is time for the second
stage now.
Jacob is over there.
You know
what you have to do.

================================================================================

Episode: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLnXTSZjKqg

Emperor Seleucus
rules every one of you.
The sooner you accept this
fact the better it is for you all.
What are you all still doing here?
Go sit in your designated place.
Go on, get lost!
Enough!
That is enough.
Good thing you are here,
Emperor Seleucus.
You could teach the
men of Takshashila a lesson.
Show them their rightful place.
It is not them,
but you, who needs a lesson.
Find some other place
for yourself and your men.
Did you hear what I said?
Go now!
Emperor.
The situation here is very critical.
I say, you should go and
enjoy the swearing in ceremony.
I and Chandragupta will see to it
that no more trouble arise here.
Come, Chandragupta.
Our plan's first stage
is a complete success.
It is time for the second stage now.
Jacob is over there.
You know what you have to do.
Yes, Chanakya. It is time to expose
the true nature of these
foreigners in front of everyone.
And to drive them out of 'India'.
Father. I heard what happened here.
Are you all right?
I feel something is not right.
You should go back home at once.
As you say, Father.
I will go this instant,
if that is what you wish.
Jacob.
We are friends.
We are on the same side.
Let us forget about the past
and build a new friendship.
'This is just the beginning.'
'Very soon, you and your
soldiers along with Seleucus'
'will be oust from my country.'
[Sanskrit shlok]
[Sanskrit shlok]
[Sanskrit shlok]
[Sanskrit shlok]
Jacob, my friend.
I do not know what it is about
but
there is someone in this festival
who has their eyes fixed on you.
Who?
Commander Vimaldev's daughter
Ambika.
After Rudradev's death
not even in my dreams I ever imagined
that Emperor Seleucus would organise
such a grand swearing
in ceremony for Malayketu
Truly He has a big heart.
A merciful heart.
I honestly believe
that Emperor Seleucus is the right person
for the betterment of
Takshashila and the Paurav.
He truly cares about us.
You can see that he made
our beloved Malayketu
the King of the Paurav.
So we should be thankful
to Emperor Seleucus.
Forgive me. I was in a hurry.
You see, I am heading out
to get medication for the Emperor.
He is injured.
What injury?
Well, he was attacked.
Malayketu, in a fit of rage
attacked Emperor Seleucus.
When did that happen?
Look, there is no need to worry.
They both have made
peace with each other.
Anyway, I should get the medicine.
Emperor,
were you attacked by Malayketu?
That was just a hot headed young boy.
Forget about it.
'Emperor Seleucus is the right person'
'for the betterment of
Takshashila and the Paurav.'
'You can see that he made
our beloved Malayketu'
'the King of the Paurav.'
What happened?
Did you not have your
eyes on me this whole time?
What is the matter now?
Do not feel shy.
You..
How dare you!
Ordinary soldier! Stay away from me.
'I will show what you are worth of.'
The coronation ceremony is concluded.
The King of Paurav Kingdom
can proceed towards the throne.
I shall take the future of Paurav
to the throne.
Chandragupta!
Acharya Chanakya, even you follow me.
'Now, I shall kill their king, Malay'
'and ruin their happiness right away.'
Just wait and watch
how I shatter your pride.
A new king is here to welcome
the future of the kingdom.
It will be a lesson for
the upcoming generations.
Today Paurav kingdom
have found their king.
Let us all welcome him.
- Hail Malayketu..
- Hail!
- Hail Prince Malayketu.
- Hail!
- Hail Prince Malayketu.
- Hail!
'I know Emperor Seleucus'
'you are compelled to
make him the king of Paurav.'
'But, I am loyal towards you.'
'I can do anything for you.'
'And I shall prove this today.'
How dare you kill the future king
of Paurav kingdom!
First, Emperor Seleucus
killed Rudradev.
Now, his minister tried
to kill our king, Malayketu.
King Puru was killed
in the same manner years ago.
You shall be punished.
All of you calm down.
I am certain that there
is some misunderstanding.
I beg your pardon.
Everybody witnessed
whatever happened here.
And his sword clears everything.
Father!
How did all this happen?
Tell me, my child.
What.. What is all this?
Here.
Who has done this? Did he do this?
It is okay.
Do not worry. You are safe.
The bad time has passed.
No, Mother.
It has not passed yet.
It has just started.
Look at them.
This is what they really are.
What are you saying, Chandragupta.
I am saying what is true
and is before everyone.
Your Majesty,
I have been dutiful towards you.
But whatever has happened here today..
If I remain quiet even today
then it would be inappropriate.
If I blindfold myself and ignore
that this soldier
is misbehaving with us
then this would be injustice
with my countrymen.
Be it people in Takshashila or Paurav.
They are my brothers.
And I cannot let injustice
happen with them.
Therefore, I'm going to stand up
against this injustice and oppression.
Listen, my dear fellow citizens.
Do you know what's happened here?
Philip is ill treating
Lord commander of Takshashila
and his soldiers.
He has crossed the line.
Moreover, he hatched a plan
and tried to kill our King.
And this soldier
tried to sexually assault
Vimaldev's daughter.
You know what?
They have no respect for our
culture or our people, whatsoever.
They treat us all like objects
nothing more than that!
I agree with what
Chandragupta is saying.
These people treat us like dust.
They are trying to turn us
all into their servants.
And they want to take
advantage of our women.
We are not going to tolerate
this oppression anymore.
He has hurt a lot of Takshashila
and Paurav's soldiers.
Soldiers of Takshashila and Paurav,
draw your swords.
Today, the soldiers
of Takshashila and Paurav
are going to fight these outsiders.
Take out your swords.
Seleucus,
we Indians, always pay our debts.
That's why we are returning
your favour with an interest.
Now you're getting a taste
of your own medicine.
Careful!
One wrong move
and these soldiers
will kill you in a second.
You will be dead right
here and right now!
Seleucus.
I guess you both have forgotten
how I got you both almost
killed five years ago.
I think it's about time
to refresh your memories.
Yes, I agree that you tried
your best to kill us both.
But I'm right here.
I'm still alive.
If I decide to kill you, Seleucus
you will be dead for sure.
Therefore, it's in you best interest
to leave this place.
Well, citizens of
Takshashila and Paurav
let's show these foreigners
the strength of Indian
unity and integrity!
Come on!
Outsider, get out of India.
Outsider, get out of India!
Outsider, get out of India..
Outsider, get out of India..
Outsider, get out of India..
Outsider, get out of India..
Outsider, get out of India..
If I mix some red colour with yellow
it will result in a beautiful
colour called orange.
But
if I keep on adding red colour
to yellow colour..
Gradually, but surely the
yellow colour will disappear.
This holds good even
for our tradition and culture.
Welcoming a foreign culture
and making it part of our lives
isn't a bad thing at all.
But letting the foreign culture
supersede our own
is just unacceptable.
The way in which two colours
give rise to a new colour
two cultures can
co-exist with each other
and give birth to a better culture.
But there's one important thing.
When one culture tries
to replace the other
both will be extinct.
My ethics..
Your destiny.
If you ever dare
to step foot on my land
then you will be accountable
for what happens.
I will return.
And when I do, you all..
You all will regret being born.

It is a scene that is so beautiful
and it brings me such joy!
Please eat! Eat all you can!
Here.
Forgive me, my Lord.
I give you my word,
I will never fail you again.
Do not kill me!
I will earn the trust of your sister.
Please give me some time.
I shall do as you say.
You think I am a fool
to kill the same man
that I had forgiven.
No!
I am doing all this
since this day is special for me.
Since on this day
my father died!
Listen to me.
You are still thinking
of me as a fool.
One who is happy on the death
anniversary of his own father!
That I celebrate instead of mourning!
No.
That is not it.
I do celebrate this day
as I was named the Emperor of Magadh.
And you now know what makes me happy.
Am I right?
No!
Fool!
This death anniversary of my father
can be a great chance for you
to earn the trust
of my sister Durdhara.
So go now.
And take advantage of this chance.
I thank you for this, Sire.
I will go to Durdhara at once.
My Lord.
What is the matter?
You well know that seeing you worried
gets me anxious.
Such is the matter, my Lord.
We have received an urgent
message from our spy from Takshashila.
What is it about?
About Chanakya's move.
One executed by Chandragupta
against Seleucus.
This does not end here.
I will return.
And when I do, you all..
You all will regret being born.
I will trample your
land beneath my foot!
One who has no ground left to stand
should not set sights
on the land of others.
And you are day dreaming, Seleucus.
Remember this well.
If you ever dare
to step foot on my land
then you will be accountable
for what happens.
Seleucus, be on guard.
And use this chance to go back alive.
Queen Mura, he is not our friend.
Yet you must
bid him farewell as tradition.
You and your Greek men
never respect our traditions.
But we Indians treat
others with respect.
And we have an old tradition.
When a guest leaves,
we give them some curd.
So that their journey is blessed.
Be it a friend or enemy.
So please accept this curd.
We give this to you
and to your friends.
- Glory to Bharat!
- Glory to Bharat!
- Glory to Bharat!
- Glory to Bharat!
- Glory to Bharat!
- Glory to Bharat!
- Glory to Bharat!
- Glory to Bharat!
- Glory to Bharat!
- Glory to Bharat!
Glory to Bharat! Glory to Bharat!
- Hail Chandragupta!
- Hail!
- Hail Chandragupta!
- Hail!
- Hail Chandragupta!
- Hail!
Just as Chandragupta has united
the armies of Paurav and Takshashila..
It is praiseworthy.
The kingdoms that were enemies
are now standing together as allies.
This alliance will be the foundation
for Chandragupta's dream
of a great United Bharat!
Acharya.
We must celebrate this
victory in a grand manner!
This unity of Paurav and Takshashila
and the declaration of
struggle for united Bharat
must be echoed in the entire landmass!
Yes, my Queen.
There will be celebrations.
Malayketu's formal coronation
remains to be done.
We will celebrate this
event along with that.
The event will end by making
Malayketu sit on his throne.
It's time
to execute the next part of our plan.
If my guess is right,
Amatya Rakshas's spies
would have told Dhananand
about what happened here.
The messenger would have found out
how we forced Seleucus
to leave this place.
Every information that
you give is always right.
That means, Chandragupta and Chanakya
must have sent Seleucus and his army
to Macedonia.
That means, they are all going
towards Magadh.
Right?
Give me orders, Your Majesty.
The Magadh army is ready
to fight Chandragupta on my command.
No.. No, Amatya..
This is not the right time for that.
Just call my brothers
for an important meeting
and yes, my sister has
to be present in the meeting.
I want to tell her how I will change
Chandragupta and Chanakya's
celebrations
to sadness and pain.
Okay, Your Majesty.
Princess, your medicines.
I don't want medicines.
Sometimes,
I think, it would have been better
if Chandragupta had not told you
the truth about your father's murder.
The truth has made you so sad.
I will never forgive
Chandragupta for this.
No, Shipra.
The truth is bitter but
it is better than the lie
that I used to believe.
How is it better?
You tried to commit suicide.
Today, I am free to
mourn during my father's
death anniversary.
He did not die naturally,
he was killed.
That too..
His own son killed him.
Some wounds take a long time to heal.
When we look back
we understand the
importance of every point.
We understand the
meaning of everything.
Chandra, I just told you
to remove a small thorn.
Why did you become so serious?
You seem so lost these days.
What?
What did I say?
What I said was right.
Chandra.
You can hide things from everyone else
but how will you hide
things from your oldest friend?
I know that you are sad for Durdhara
during this celebration.
You would obviously be sad.
It is not what you think it is.
I..
I do not think about Durdhara.
Yes.
Why do you need to think about her?
You got her favourite
flowers to decorate this place
for the celebration, without thinking.
Chandra.
Acharya has told me that it is useless
to run away from your feelings.
That is why, do not run away
from your feelings for Durdhara.
Princess.
This is for you.
I have organised a feast
for your father's death anniversary.
I have got this offertory for you.
Forgive me, Princess. Your favourite
flowers are also in this.
I found out that you like them a lot.
I thought, I should bring these also.
You might feel better
after seeing them.
You must be thinking that
I am doing this to win your trust.
Let me tell you.
Yes, I am doing this for you.
I have feelings for you
even after what happened.
I am sure, one day, I will be
worthy of your love and trust.
I beg your pardon, Princess Durdhara.
The emperor has called
for an important meeting.
It is important for you
and Prince Ambikumar to attend it.
'What can be the reason
for this sudden assembly?'
'Is it related to Chandragupta?'
This is the sign
of the state of Assaka.
Acharya, which message
are you sending to Assaka?
Yes, Chandragupta.
This is Assaka's sign.
And I am not only inviting
Assaka but all the 14 states
to take part in this grand
ceremony of untied Bharat.
I am certain, Acharya
that you are doing all this
so that they can
also experience freedom.
So that, they can also
enjoy this unique experience.
Maybe, they could
also have achieved that.
If they would have fought
against Dhananand for their rights.
Yes, Chandragupta.
After Malayketu's formal coronation,
I will tell everyone
how you untied the armies
of Takshashila and Paurav empire.
And I will cite your example
and try to make them realise
that if they are untied
they can defeat Dhananand.
And they can free their respective
districts from his dominion.
Our purpose is very big.
And to fulfill that we need
to bring everyone into our team.
Chandragupta, if we want
to establish a untied Bharat
then we have to bring every district of Bharat
ranging from north to south,
from east to west in our favour.
We will have to bring
them to the same platform.
Just the way you untied the
states of Takshashila and Paurav.
Only then there will be
one nation and one emperor.
And then Chandragupta's empire of the
Maurya dynasty will be established.
But, Acharya!
Do you think
they will support us in fulfilling
our dream of untied Bharat?
Certainly!
They will definitely support us,
Chandragupta.
Do you know why?
That is the specialty of freedom.
It always inspires people.
Ma'am, tell me something.
That when King Chandravardhan
and you used to sit on
the throne of the forest..
It must have been a very grand
and divine spectacle, right?
That day..
That day was the most memorable..
Mother!
I have a good news.
What is it, dear?
All the 14 districts have
accepted Acharya's invitation.
And all of them are
attending Malay's coronation
and the grand ceremony
of untied Bharat.
Very good!
That means, we need to make
a lot of arrangements now.
I will make sure
that everything is done.
What is the matter, Mother?
Nothing.
I am just very happy
to hear this good news.
No, Mother.
You are hiding your
sorrow behind this smile.
Tell me. What is the matter?
I cannot forget my love
for Piplivan, Chandra.
No matter how much I try..
The memories of my home
excites me.
If that is the case, Mother
then we will start for the forest
the moment this ceremony is over.
Because first of all,
I need to take my mother
to her home, to her motherland.
But, Chandra..
That is not in our agenda.
Maybe, this is not
the right time to go there.
Never mind, Mother.
We can include it in our agenda.
No, Chandragupta.
We can do it later.
I can understand your
emotions for your mother.
But this is not the right time to
take some wrong step being emotional.
Instead, we need to be
patient and follow our plan.
One mistake.
One mistake will be
enough for our defeat.
And why to give Dhananand
that opportunity?
For which he is waiting eagerly?
This is the time to
accumulate our strength.
We need to acquire
more supporters and make
ourselves stronger.
Okay, Acharya.
But I will free Piplivan
from Dhananand's clutches soon.
No matter what his plan is.
If a small thorn pricks our feet..
it does not hurt much.
But if we do not take
it out from our body on time..
It becomes a wound.
And that wound becomes sore
and pains.
In the same way, in our life
small differences in
opinion or misunderstandings
can cause big problems.
That is why, small misunderstandings
or differences in opinion
should be resolved immediately.
Solve those.
So that, we can avoid
big problems in future.
My ethics..
Your destiny.
When you capture that
Chanakya and Chandragupta
do not wait for me.
Slay them that very moment.

================================================================================

Episode: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeRNhLja3kc

My elder brothers!
Pandugati..
- Pandugati..
- Yes?
Pandu..
Rashtrapal, Bhutapal..
Dasha-siddhaki and Kaivarta..
I have summoned you all here today
to convey one good news
and one bad news.
First, the bad news..
My arch-enemies..
That cunning Brahmin Chanakya
and that wicked Chandragupta
have succeeded at uniting
the Paurav kingdom and Takshashila.
Apart from resolving
their years old conflict
they even sacked Seleucus
from their territory.
But the good news is
now is the time
to take a call upon
the pointless lives
of my useless brothers.
So far you were living
in great luxury under my reign.
But now
the time has come to prove
the purpose of your existence.
Because now, that wicked Chandragupta
blinded by his arrogance,
will surely turn to Magadh.
So, tell me..
What all responsibilities
would each of you shoulder?
What is your strategy
to vanquish my enemy?
Tell me.
I will ensure the availability
of armed forces and weaponry
so that we are fully prepared
for any surprise attacks.
I will impose taxes across the state
and use the amount to
hire newer and better spies.
There are dense forests in my forests.
I will lay traps there.
If the enemy forces try to invade
we will hold them off there.
I will prepare my best archers
so that every soldier from
Chandragupta's army can be slain
before they set foot
into our territory.
I will procure the best and
most advanced armour for my forces.
I will personally train
the soldiers of my kingdom.
Excellent!
Finally, my elder brothers
have proven their worth.
But remember..
When you capture that
Chanakya and Chandragupta
do not wait for me.
Slay them that very moment.
Show no mercy,
hesitation or compassion.
Kill them at sight.
'I must warn Chandragupta
at any cost.'
'I must warn him about
His Majesty's plan.'
You!
What are you doing here?
Well, it does not matter
how you came here.
All that matters is
that you are here, Durdhara.
If you are so glad about my arrival
why did you even let go of me?
I..
I do not have an
answer to this question.
You should not have left her,
Chandragupta.
What are you talking about?
My spies have brought me
a message from Magadh.
What is it?
It is some bad news
related to Durdhara.
Oh, dear!
Forgive me.
I am making plans to
slay your dearest friend.
But is he truly your friend?
What can I say? He left you
with your cruel brother, that is, me.
Whether he is your friend or not..
Clarify this.
Your Majesty, you cannot talk
to the princess in this manner.
- This is improper.
- Hey!
I feel like beheading you and
offering your head at the king's feet!
How dare you, peasant!
No one can talk to the king
in that manner.
No!
No, Brother.
Sometimes,
I get swayed by emotions and forget
that I'm being cruel
to my ailing sister.
Well, at least there is someone
who has the audacity
to make me realise that.
And is bold enough
to ask me to tone down.
All of you, please calm down
and put your swords
back into their sheath.
Let us start over now.
You have all clearly told me
your strategies.
I will explain my strategy
to you all now.
If that critter enters my land
despite your presence
then I will slay you all
before I slay him.
And you all know that bloodletting
is not new to me.
Especially,
if it is about killing my kin.
You know what?
This person sitting on the throne
always humiliates you all.
And you all..
You deserve it.
You are planning someone's murder.
And you will face the same fate.
As far as I am concerned
I will mourn at
my father's death anniversary.
Because I know that none of you
mourned his death.
And neither do you grieve
now nor will you ever.
Princess! Please wait.
What are you all waiting for?
Go and follow my orders.
Minister, now all our plans
are working out well
yet you clearly look worried.
Is the reason behind it is
that Chanakya has invited
all the chiefs of the
14 districts to the function?
Do you know about that, Your Majesty?
Yes.
But I am wondering
that when that they will
be revelling in the function
then will they offer me gifts
or shall I give them a gift?
Your Highness.
What happened to Durdhara?
As soon as Durdhara reached Magadh
Dhananand and Durdhara
got into an argument.
'Why did you do this?'
'Why did you join hands
with my enemies?'
'I did what you deserve.'
'If this is how I should be punished'
'then kill me.'
'Nobody is stopping you.'
No!
Calm down, Chandragupta. Calm down.
There was no mishap.
Durdhara being alive
was no less than a miracle.
That means, Durdhara is alive.
Yes.
But she has not recovered completely.
Acharya and mother were right.
I should not have left Durdhara there.
I am responsible
for Durdhara condition.
I have made a grave mistake.
I should not have left her alone.
But now..
I have to save Durdhara
from her ruthless brother.
But it is not possible
to go there and save her.
It would risk her life.
You are right.
But, Ambika,
can your informers find out
if Durdhara can come
out of the palace?
Do not worry, Chandragupta.
I have already told my informers.
If Durdhara comes out of the palace
them my informers will inform you.
Thank you, Ambika.
Princess, listen to me.
You are not in a condition to go out.
Stop it, Shipra.
Nobody can stop me from visiting
our ancestral shrine on
my father's death anniversary.
I shall certainly go.
I am not stopping you.
But it is far away from here.
It is in the forest.
It is amidst the waterfall
from the three directions.
Think about it.
What if anything happens to you?
Nothing will happen to you.
Look at me.
My brother revived me.
He shall not let me die so easily.
Go out of my way.
Nobody can stop me today.
Move away.
Princess. Listen to me.
You know your brother so well, Sister.
But it has become important
to tell you the truth.
Our father is dead!
He shall not come back
no matter where you go.
It is bitter but this is the truth.
Therefore, give up your stubbornness
and do not trouble me.
Did you understand?
Princess should get proper
rest and peaceful environment.
Remember this.
'The more you try to stop me'
'the more I will
try to go out of here.'
'I will not only go
to give tribute to father'
'but also to meet Chandragupta.'
'I will tell him everything
about your strategy.'
'It is not my stubbornness,
but my pledge.'
The person due to whom
I am celebrating this occasion
who has made impossible
into possible..
He has united Paurav and Takshashila.
We shall be in debt to him.
Repeat after me.
- Hail Prince Chandragupta!
- Hail!
- Hail Acharya Chanakya!
- Hail.
- Hail Prince Chandragupta!
- Hail!
Most of the times in history
men and their
achievements are praised.
But the struggle
sacrifice and pain of the
women have always been ignored.
So, let us all change the
history along with the present.
Hereafter, we must give credit
to the women present in our lives.
Because their contribution
in the growth of our country
is beyond any comparison.
Perhaps, we are forgetting
that they have contributed
in this victory.
The truth is that
Seleucus has left India
with his army because of them.
If Ambika,
Mother
and a very special lady
who is not present here..
We could not be able
to achieve this success
without their contribution.
Hence, chant with me.
- Hail women power!
- All Hail!
- Hail women power!
- All Hail!
- Hail women power!
- All Hail!
Chandragupta,
the one who respects women
and admires them makes
progress in his life.
I am proud of you, Chandragupta.
Finally the moment
has arrived which we were
eagerly waiting for.
We consider ourselves very fortunate
that we are getting a chance
to welcome the respective heads
of all 14 states to this grand event.
Come, Chandragupta.
This is..
This is the message of
the king of Avanti, Acharya.
Read it out.
'Please excuse me.
Due to some unavoidable circumstances'
'I will not be able to take part in
the grand celebration of united India'
'and the coronation ceremony
of Malayketu, the king of Paurav.'
'And I regret for this.'
Acharya, the same thing
is written in this too.
Chandragupta, leave it.
Even it will contain the same message.
But Acharya, how is this possible?
Dhananand.
Your Highness,
today is a joyous day for us.
I am very happy to
see you in a jovial mood
after a long time.
Is this because you have
spoiled Chandragupta's plan?
I mean, no state leader
attended his celebration.
Amatya Rakshas,
you are understanding me gradually.
Very good.
Chanakya made a brilliant move.
Every invitation card
was wrapped in velvet
and was sent to every state
head with respective state emblems
with a lot of hope.
But all their efforts
have gone in vain.
Because no state head attended
the coronation ceremony
of Malayketu and the grand
celebration of united India.
Not even a single state head.
I had the information
that all the state heads had
agreed to attend their celebration.
But how did you force them
to change their mind all of a sudden?
Amatya Rakshas, a potent ruler
is aware of everyone's weakness
including his friends and enemies.
If one is aware of this
it is easy for him
to make someone dance to his tune.
I have enough ammunition
against all 14 state heads.
They will never try
to go against me again.
What are you referring to,
Your Highness?
I will tell you about that later.
Let me celebrate my victory now.
Whenever we achieve a success
Dhananand forces us to back off.
Why does he spoil our
every success and plan?
This is beyond my understanding too.
How did he force 14 state heads
not to attend our celebration?
I do not know which
trick Dhananand played.
But I know
what will be our next move.
After Takshashila and Paurav,
we will march towards Piplivan.
Chandragupta.
As far as Piplivan is concerned
I hope that you still
remember my suggestion.
Yes, Acharya.
I remember your every word.
When you selected me
as the future emperor of India
you told me clearly
that this journey
will be very difficult.
It will be hard and complex.
But I should keep moving
towards my goal without fail.
Acharya, I am doing the same.
My dream.. Our dream is united India.
I am moving towards our goal.
Shrewd Dhananand has played
a trick to tame all 14 state heads.
But I will definitely find a way
to free them from his control.
I will give them a ray of hope
by freeing my state, Piplivan,
from Dhananand's dominance.
And I am not alone in this mission.
Takshashila army and
Paurav army are with me.
Chandra.
I am feeling as if you
have taken this decision
because of me.
You should not do this if it is true.
Do not forget your duties
towards your motherland for
the sake of your mother's sentiment.
What if this decision backfires on us?
Mother, my sentiments lay
the foundation of my existence.
As you said,
I am doing everything for you.
But it is true
that my motherland is my priority.
I want to build a new nation, Mother.
And nothing can be
better than this
if I start this battle
from my birth place, Piplivan.
Let us march towards Piplivan.
Princess.
Princess, I know that it is you.
Please stop.
Please forgive me, Princess.
I could not let you do this.
After whatever happened
in the past few days
you need to take every step
very carefully, Princess.
And please try to sort out
your relation with your brother,
Princess.
I request you, Princess.
Please do not bring any
more harm to the relation.
Enough, Amatya Rakshas..
I think the princess does
not need your suggestions.
And about your duty,
you have done it properly.
Following the king's orders,
you did not let the princess leave.
- Your task is done.
- Quiet!
Even after whatever happened here
everyone knows that if
you try to get out of here
then His Highness himself
will have to intervene.
And if His Highness does that,
then you all know
the consequences very well.
Princess.
If you will allow,
then I can help you in this matter.
I know why you want
to go out of the palace.
Because you wanted
to inform Chandragupta
about His Highness's plan, right?
I just want to give
a tribute to my father
on his death anniversary.
That is why I want
to go to the temple.
Wow!
Your feelings towards
your father are so steady.
And I know that you have the
same feeling for Chandragupta as well.
And I know that we are always worried
about the safety of
the person whom we love.
No matter whether you trust me or not
but I can help you reach the temple
from where you can also
send a message to Chandragupta.
This is strange, Chandra.
Today, you did not give
information about the rain.
Oh. Really?
Usually, Chandragupta used to forecast
the rain just by looking at the sky.
But he is quiet today.
A-Actually..
Oh, yes.
It will definitely rain today.
I do not know how I did not notice.
- Maybe I know the reason.
- And me too.
A-All of you are thinking
about useless things.
I am not thinking
anything about Durdhara.
But none of us talked about Durdhara,
Chandragupta.
A-All of you are getting me wrong.
It is going to rain soon.
Chandragupta, my informers
from Magadh sent a message
that Durdhara tried
to go to the temple
on the hill by getting
out of the palace
but Amatya has stopped her.
I know, Durdhara.
She will not give up so easily.
She is very stubborn.
If she decides to do something
then does not give up
without completing it.
Princess, you? Please come in.
How come you are here?
Was it true what you said?
Will you help me?
Will you take me to our temple?
Everything that I said
to you is true, Princess.
I-It is a very big challenge.
You do not know my brother.
He can do anything to
make people follow his orders.
You just leave it on me,
as to how to convince him.
'I hope that I am not wrong
while trusting Ambikumar.'
Durdhara is stupid.
Her health is already not good
but she is still stubborn
to go against Dhananand.
And not just this.
The path of the temple
where she wants to go
is very difficult.
Then go and make sure that
Durdhara goes to the temple
and she also stays safe forever.
- You mean..
- You know what I mean.
Go and bring her here.
But..
But right now,
I need to go to Piplivan.
Chandragupta.
When we have a burden
of any past mistake inside us
then it becomes very difficult
for us to move forward.
I know
that the burden of whatever
you did to Durdhara
is troubling you on the inside.
That is why you are finding
difficulty in moving ahead.
Go, Chandra.
Anyways, it is going to rain now.
We are going to wait here.
I want to discuss something
important with His Highness.
Open the gate.
It is about Princess Durdhara.
'Ambikumar, I hope'
'you are not taking on responsibilities
beyond your capacity.'
I know why you are here.
You can do anything you please.
You can do anything you please.
But before that you
must join me for drinks.
I have launched a major strategy
against Chandragupta
and Chanakya today.
I thwarted there plan
of uniting the 14 districts.
That is why, at this time
enjoy the drinks.
This..
This is great news, King Dhananand.
- Hail King Dhananand.
- Hail!
Let us see how good
are your acting skills.
King Dhananand,
I came here to tell you
that what you are doing is wrong.
You may hand me the death sentence
but the truth is you cannot
stop Durdhara from paying homage.
This is injustice!
And I will never allow that.
How dare you!
You are forgetting your
place and manners, Ambikumar.
It is not me, King Dhananand
but you,
who has forgotten your manners
and preventing a daughter
from paying homage to her father.
Even our enemies
do not deserve this.
And Princess Durdhara is your sister!
She is your paternal sister
who you love more than anything.
I request you
that you can be strict on Durdhara
but today
give her the freedom
to do what she wants.
And possibly you might find Durdhara
to become her old self,
one who loved you the most.
Nothing meant more
to her than her brother.
The solution to every problem
is contained within love
and not in anger and maliciousness.
What is going on?
Why is Dhananand quiet?
Oh!
You are here, Durdhara.
I was coming to meet you.
By the way, I have convinced the King.
With your brother's
blessings and permission
we can go to the Mother Goddess's
temple and pay homage
to your father.
Really?
I can think of no words to thank you.
Thank you, Prince.
Thank you very much.
No, there is no need to thank me.
I just want you to
promise me something
and always keep that promise.
A promise?
Promise what?
'You do not know, Chandra'
'for how long I have
been looking for you.'
'For a long time'
'I had just one hope to cling to.'
'I know'
'it will take a long time
for me to regain your trust.'
'But you cannot leave me like this.'
'Forgive me, Durdhara'
'that it took me this
long to realise my mistake.'
'But soon I will fix everything.'
'I am on my way. I am coming to you.'
What is this, my King?
Why do you have tears in your eyes
when everything is going
according to your plan?
Rakshas, if there is anything
more precious to me than wealth
it is my sister, Durdhara.
Look how destiny is playing out.
In order to destroy my nemesis
I am forced to utilise
my very own sister.
But
I have
no other option.
Come on, Rakshas
let us bring Chandragupta's
story to an end.
Of course, my King.
There is a very important similarity
between a great ruler
and the roots of a tree.
Just like the roots
provide soil, water
and other necessary nutrients
to ensure the tree's growth
the same way, a great ruler
like the roots of a tree, ensures the growth
of various elements and
the citizens of a kingdom.
Remember
the growth of society
and it's elements, is possible
only when it's leaders and influential
people have a clear understanding
that, unity and integrity
is not an attainment of society
but a necessity.
My ethics..
Your destiny.
Priest, heed my request.
Deliver my message to him.
- His name is..
- Chandragupta.
I cannot believe it is you.
Durdhara.

================================================================================

Episode: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qo_zQDG3avw

'When you capture
Chandragupta and Chanakya'
'do not wait for me.'
'Kill them right there and then.'
'I hope you are all right,
Chandragupta.'
'Come, Chandragupta.'
'Let us end this game
of hide and seek.'
'You cannot escape the
trap I have laid this time.'
'I feel someone's presence here.'
'Someone is here.'
'I have to reach the temple
as soon as possible.'
Come, Princess. Let us go.
If you do not have any objection
can I spend some moments
alone in this temple?
I do not know if I will
get this chance again.
I want to pay homage to my father
with only his sweet
memories as my companion.
Of course, Princess.
That is your right.
Why would I have any objection?
Please go. I will wait for you here.
Thank you.
Priest, you have to help me.
I have to send a very
important message to someone.
- Immediately.
- This is a temple, Lady
not some animal pen where
messages are exchanged.
Look, I know it is not your job.
But someone's life depends on it.
The one I am trying to help
is a very brave and sensitive man.
I have never seen anyone like him.
He is the future of this nation.
It is the duty of every
Indian to protect him.
We have to save him from
King Dhananand's deadly trap.
The trap he has laid to capture him.
Priest, heed my request.
Deliver my message to him.
- His name is..
- Chandragupta.
How do you know his name?
You!
It is you.
I cannot believe it is you.
You just sat there listening to me.
Why did you not say it is you?
And why are you looking
at me like that?
It feels nice to look
at you like this.
It could be fatal to talk
to a princess like that.
Really?
Is it more dangerous than jumping
from the top most floor of the palace?
And making a strong plan to run away
from the palace in such a condition
and reaching here at the end.
Princess, is it more dangerous
than this to look at you like this?
Is it not more dangerous
to stand so close to me
and prove that you are not concerned
about your servant?
When it comes to taking any trouble
or performing any dangerous task
even I am not anything
when compared to you.
Is there anything else apart from this
that you want to tell me?
Yes.
I should not have left you alone
with your brother on that day.
I had made a big mistake.
Please forgive me.
And?
And..
What else do you want to hear?
What do I know?
You are such a famous warrior.
You give a lecture to
the council and the army.
You are the future king of India.
Why do you need my help?
Even I had this misconception
that I do not need your help.
But I have realised now
that this was my mistake.
The truth that I was
denying all this while
cannot be denied anymore.
But I have understood now
what you mean to me, Durdhara.
Listen, do not talk in riddles.
I do not like to
discuss random topics.
Tell me clearly and directly.
Durdhara.
What is he doing here?
Chandragupta Maurya.
I cannot get a better opportunity
than this to seek revenge from you.
I will put an end to
your chapter right now.
You will definitely be punished
for what you have done to my father.
Ambikumar, even you know very well
that you cannot fight
against him even for a second.
Do as I say and calm down.
Let us go from here, Durdhara.
She will not go anywheree with you.
I have brought a solution with me
to clear this misconception of yours.
Look at that.
What is happening here?
Wedding!
Our wedding.
Durdhara and Ambikumar's wedding.
Is this true?
Yes.
This is true.
You did this intentionally, right?
Am I right?
Throw him out.
Congratulations
on your wedding.
Princess, I am very happy
that you kept your promise.
'I have convinced the king.'
''We can go to the family God's
temple to pay homage to your father.'
'Really?'
'Thank you very much.'
'No, I do not need your thanks.'
'You will have to
promise me one thing'
'and you will always
have to keep up that promise.'
'Promise?'
'What promise?'
'The moment your reach
your family God's temple'
'and offer homage to your father'
'we will get married after that'
'with the blessings of father'
'and your family God.'
'Yes, Durdhara.'
'You will have to marry me.'
'Now, the decision is yours,
Princess.'
'I will do as you say.'
'This is the right time to send
a message to Chandragupta'
'that somehow I reach the temple.'
'Come what may, I have to save
Chandragupta from this trouble.'
'Okay. I promise'
'that as soon as we reach the temple'
'we will get married.'
On this path..
I am coming after so many
years in these jungles, Acharya.
But the memories of this
place are embedded in my heart.
I still remember that dark moment
when Dhananand snatched away my home
family and my kingdom.
And now, I am waiting for that moment
when my son Chandragupta
will get back my pride
and honour for me.
Eventually,
he will conquer the wicked Dhananand..
Wipe out his name, his identity
and his dark deeds from Piplivan..
And with pride, he will take over
the throne of Piplivan
which once belonged to his father.
Halt!
The royal priest?
Royal priest..
It is me.. Queen Mura.
I am the wife of King Chandravardhan.
Those kings are gone who
used to sit on that throne.
And those who are going
to take over that throne
will pass on into the night.
You cockroach!
When you advance, you presume
that you are choosing your path.
No! Never!
Just like before, even this time
I am the one who who is
heading you to your path and duty.
Now look!
Today, your path has
brought you in front of me..
In front of your death!
- Attack!
- Attack!
Archers..
Attack!
The life of Chandragupta is in danger.
The life of my son is in danger.
We have to be with him without delay.
Lady, for no reason, you are worrying.
There is no need to pay
heed what that sage proclaimed.
According to me,
that old man did not know
what he was talking about.
No, Stulbhadra.
If he has mentioned something
then, there has to be
a reason behind his prophecy.
We have to go to Chandragupta.
What is that smoke?
That smoke is emitting from the place
where Chandragupta
has gone to meet Durdhara.
Right now
we have to go there
and help Chandragupta.
Priest, star the
rituals of the wedding.
[Sanskrit chants]
[Sanskrit shlok]
'Durdhara, you have no idea'
'that from today,
your life will become miserable.'
'I will avenge my insults'
'from you and your brother.'
No need to worry, Your Highness.
Death might come late for him
but definitely, he cannot escape it.
That is because his death is imminent!
Even I want this to happen, Mahamatya.
I want to gift the
dead body of this imbecile
to my adorable sister.
[Sanskrit shlok]
[Sanskrit shlok]
You both, please stand up
for the circumambulations.
Chandragupta!
Stop, Durdhara!
Complete the circumambulations,
Durdhara.
- You gave me word.
- Word!
What kind of word!
You betrayed me!
You and brother used me
as a temptation together
to trap Chandragupta.
I do not believe in any word.
What did you say? Betrayed?
Did you not betray me?
Yes.
I and your brother planned
this conspiracy together.
What did you think?
Will I spare Chandragupta
who killed my father?
Today, he will get the
death which he deserves.
A painful and torturous death
which will trap him very soon.
As long as I am alive
I will not let brother or
anyone else to reach Chandragupta.
Stop, Durdhara!
Chandragupta, nobody thought
that your death will be so ordinary.
Get out of here.
Your husband
must be waiting for you.
No.
I will not go anywhere.
If you want to kill Chandragupta
then you will have to attack me first!
Get aside, Durdhara!
Get aside, Durdhara!
No! I will not go
anywhere without you!
Stop, Ambikumar.
Great.
I will end this, what you started.
You will never be able to kill
Chandragupta, Brother Dhananand!
No!
Durdhara!
Forgive me, My Lord.
I never expected that
Durdhara would take this step.
Please forgive me.
I know.
You didn't expect
all this could take place.
That's why you couldn't save Durdhara.
But you are very lucky.
I am providing you another
opportunity to rectify your mistake.
Go
and find my sister.
Soldiers!
I know Chandragupta as
well as my sister, very well.
Neither will Chandragupt die so easily
nor will my sister
give away so easily.
Go and find them.
Chandra! Chandra, wake up.
Chandra, hope you are all right.
Open your eyes.
Wake up, Chandra.
I will not let anything happen to you.
'I won't spare you, Chandragupta.'
Chandra, open your eyes.
Wake up, Chandra.
Chandra..
Chandra.
Princess!
You used to say that
you are very brave
and you don't panic even
at dire situations
then why did you get restless
on spotting some blood?
Tell me.
Don't speak.
Try harder. Put more efforts.
Pull. Pull more strongly.
Winning and losing
are an indispensible part of any game.
When one participates in a game
one will win and the other will lose.
But whether you win or lose
you have to always respect
the opposite player.
The same policy of the game
applies even at war field.
Because, the respect you
offer to your enemy to your opponent
will describe your character.
Remember, whether it is a playground
or a battlefield
a true winner is the one
who knows the art of accepting
both victory and loss.
My ethics..
Your destiny.
Let us go, Your Highness.
Let us go and end the
story of Chandragupta.

================================================================================

Episode: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WZGfHIgvQQ

Princess.
You used to say
that you are very brave.
And that, no matter how big a danger
you are never afraid.
So, how come
the sight of a little
blood got you worried?
Tell me.
Do not talk.
Just tell me how
do I stop the bleeding?
There..
Do you see that tree
with yellow flowers?
Yes.
Bring the biggest thorn
you can find
- in that tree.
- A thorn?
Yes.
Your husband stabbed me
on my back with his dagger.
So, I am sure
you can at least stab me with a thorn.
He is not my husband!
I did not complete my
circumambulations with him.
I will get the thorn.
Here you go.
- What now?
- Now
come close.
What?
You heard it.
Come close to me.
Now, use this thread
and that thorn
to stitch my wound.
What?
No! I cannot do that!
I have an easy task for you, Princess.
Go sit over there
and watch me die
a slow death from a far.
You are a princess.
That will be more
akin to your standards.
Go. This task is beyond you.
Go on.
All right. I will do it.
Be patient, Chandra.
Where is Chandra?
Where is he, Chanakya?
I do not see him!
Mura, Chandragupta
jumped into the river.
Look over there.
This must have been the
only way he could save himself.
Because of the training I gave him
Chandragupta can hold his breath
in deepest of waters.
I am confident that he
made it to the river bank.
We must get there as soon as possible.
Let us go.
I must go deep inside this forest.
That is probably where
Chandragupta is hiding.
I know where he is, my Lord.
You are
still alive?
I am surprised!
Where is he?
I have not seen him.
But, I have an idea
as to where he might go.
I do not have time to waste
on your useless guesses!
Move aside!
If what you said turns out to be false
then I will behead you and
present your head to the king.
Go with Ambikumar
and find Chandragupta
and Princess Durdhara.
Go.
Durdhara, where are we going?
In that open field, anyone from
Magadh army could have spotted you.
That is why I have
brought you to this forest.
You will be able
to take some rest here.
No.
As far as I know your brother
he will look for me
in a place like this.
Chandragupta!
I will hurt you so much
that your body will be
covered with wounds
I give you before you die.
Your Majesty,
the soldiers have informed me
Chanakya and his companions have been
spotted in northern part of the forest.
Why are we wasting
our here then, Amatya?
Let us go there right now!
I now understand how you
have evaded brother for so long.
You have started
thinking just like him.
Yes, you are right, Your Highness.
But unfortunately
I still do not know
what goes on in his sister's head.
I do not know
when she would jump down
a tall tower of a palace
or decided to marry someone.
I do not know when
she would jump down a cliff
and take me down with her.
- Is that so?
- Hey..
Do not forget that I am the reason
you are still alive.
If you have problem with me
then you go your
way and I will go mine.
Hey..
Your Highness, forgive me!
Forgive your servant..
Your Highness.
Princess, you must come with us.
She won't go anywhere.
No!
Oh, my God! Chandragupta!
Are you okay!
I am fine.
But who saved us
- by killing these soldiers?
- Mister Chanakya.
It is definitely Mister
Chanakya who saved us.
No. That cannot be Mister Chanakya.
- What do you mean?
- Chandra!
Are you both all right?
Acharya..
If none of you helped us
then how did these soldiers die?
Chandragupta.
These small arrows are made up
of wood from a special tree.
I know
where that tree is in this
forest which it is made up of.
I can find out that who helped us.
No, Chandra.
Look at your condition.
You're badly injured.
- You will not go anywhere.
- No, Mother.
We are surrounded by enemies
and as of now what we need
the most is someone's support.
And in that case,
if someone wants to help us
and wants to become our friend
then we have to find them
soon and have to befriend them.
Chandragupta is right.
He is thinking like a future king.
Do not stop him.
He can take care of himself.
Go, Chandragupta.
Who can that be?
Whoever he is
but he can definitely assist us
in this battle against Dhananand.
This sound?
This is the tree
using which this arrow is made.
Then where is that person
who saved my life?
It is a woman's ornament.
That means she is a woman.
The plan needs to be changed.
So, you are the woman
who helped us.
Now, the question is who you are.
Answer me.
Who are you?
Why have you been following
me from Takshashila?
You cannot be an enemy.
If you had been my enemy
you would not have saved me.
If you are friendly
why were you hiding?
Explain your motives.
I wanted to free your leg
from this creeper.
I did not want to harm you.
But you are going to be hurt.
You should not be here.
End his life..
End his life..
On one hand, I have a lamp.
And the other, I have flint rocks.
Both of them are capable
of igniting a flame.
But what if I put
both of them
in water?
The lamp
will lose its shape and
the ability to sustain a flame.
But these rocks
will lose neither their
shape nor their quality.
The same thing happens with humans.
Often, we see two different
people with the same ability.
But under dire conditions
one of them loses composure
just like this lamp
and the other
remains infallible like the flint.
That is why when you have
to appoint someone as your assistant
put them through a test to know
if they retain their capabilities
like the rocks
or they accept defeat and
lose composure like the lamp
while facing difficult situations.
My ethics..
Your destiny.
I mean my poisonous dart
has already penetrated
Chandragupta's cover of victory.
My poisonous dart
will spell his death.

================================================================================

Episode: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzrKyhlJ7JU

Kill him..
Kill him..
Chandra!
Beware!
If you even step towards my son
you will have to face me.
Why are you bowing before us?
Because you are the only ones
whom we bow before.
For years, we have hoped
and waited for meeting our queen
and our prince, Chandragupta Maurya.
Forgive us.
We made the mistake
of attacking our prince.
I am Shyam Singh, Your Highness.
I am your loyal servant.
They are the residents of Piplivan.
Yes, Chandra..
I am.. I am unable to believe it.
Even I am unable to believe
that I am seeing my queen and prince.
Is this a dream?
The dream is being realised,
Shyam Singh.
I thank God
that you all are fine.
We are fine, Your Highness.
But Piplivan has
turned into a thought.
Dhananand's attack
deprived us of everything.
Every day, we are struggling
to live in this forest.
And her?
She does not seem to be from Piplivan.
Who is she?
We are alive because of her.
When Dhananand attacked Piplivan
she saved us from his wrath.
She lost her memory
because of the injury.
She does not know who she is
where she is from or
whom she is related to.
We tried a lot to
bring her memories back.
But we were not successful.
She must have been a great warrior.
But today, her life has turned
into a sad story with no memories.
You protected my subjects.
I am thankful to you.
What is your name?
Tarini.
I am Tarini.
Tarini?
Your name is synonymous
to your character.
The subjects of Piplivan!
From today onwards
all your difficulties
have come to an end.
You have faced enough struggles.
Because today,
King Chandravardhan's son
Prince Chandragupta
Maurya has returned
to free his motherland
from Dhananand's clutches.
He is back to return Piplivan
to its former glory and identity.
Come forth
and join us in this rebellion.
Will it be easy to free Piplivan,
Your Highness?
Great goals are never simple.
This struggle is
not limited to Piplivan.
In fact, it is a struggle
to form a united India!
This is not just a war.
This is a war of righteousness.
Piplivan's independence
will be our first step
towards dethroning Dhananand.
This victory will give us an India
which will have no place
for a cruel king like Dhananand.
So tell me!
Residents of Piplivan!
Will you support me in this rebellion
and the war of righteousness?
No.
Sire, we will not go to Piplivan.
I will not leave this forest.
But, Tarini
our queen and prince are back.
They will win over our land for us.
Then why should we live like refugees?
How can we be sure that we will win?
Do you trust them implicitly?
Sire, until now, we have
lived in this forest peacefully.
We will do so in future as well.
Now, we do not need
to face any trouble.
All right, Tarini.
If you want the same then so be it.
Queen Mura, as far as Tarini
allows us and feels comfortable
we will help you to that extent.
All right. I can understand it.
'Something is telling me'
'that your reality is different
than what you are projecting.'
'Something is hidden
in the plain sight.'
Your Highness, what are you doing?
Calm down, Brother.
We will find Durdhara.
Do not take any decision in haste.
My foolish Brother, I am making
this pyre for that boy and not myself!
For Chandragupta?
Yes! Chandragupta
stole my sister's heart.
My sister
jumped into a deep river for him.
She is traversing
through a dense forest.
For that scamp, my sister
betrayed me so many times.
So, for such a great person
I should organise perfect last rites.
Your Highness, whenever
we set a trap for Chandragupta
he has freed himself somehow.
That is why before planning his death
we have to entrap
him in a complicated trap.
A plan that stops him
from escaping his death.
The plan that you are
thinking has already been
set in motion, Amatya Rakshas.
Soon, the plan will
start paying dividends.
What do you mean?
I mean my poisonous dart
has already penetrated
Chandragupta's cover of victory.
It will spread its poison slowly
and bring Chandragupta to this pyre.
My poisonous dart
will spell his death.
Chandra..
I cannot tell you how happy I am
by seeing my subjects
alive and serving them food.
For so many years
our innocent subjects have been yearning
to fulfill smallest of their needs.
They faced toughest of situations
and stayed alive.
I know, Mother.
I understand all their difficulties.
But do not worry.
Soon, they will not
only have good food
but they will have homes to live too.
They will have their own lands
in their own kingdom.
It is not easy to win a battle,
Chandragupta.
I agree that the times are changing
but still Dhananand has
an edge over this battle.
I know that as we speak right now
Dhananand is definitely
strategising a plan
how to attack us.
So, in these conditions
if we have to build a new India
and gain victory over Piplivan
then we will also be
needing a deft strategy.
I have already thought of a plan,
Acharya.
Please come with me.
This is the fort of Piplivan.
And here.. The sentries of
Dhananand are always alert here.
With the assistance of the army
of Paurav and the people of Piplivan
we can attack this
fort from two sides.
And then, surrounding the
soldiers of Magadh from all sides
we will defeat them.
Chandragupta.
This plan seems to be easy
but it is very difficult
to make it successful.
Do you think that by defeating
a fraction of the army
of Dhananand, will we be
able to defeat his mammoth army?
Not at all.
We need to deal with
this problem deftly.
You need to give a serious thought,
Chandragupta.
Think if there can
be an another option?
What option are you
talking about, Acharya?
You have the sister of Dhananand.
And now, you want to gain
victory over the kingdom.
By continuously attacking
the bastions of Dhananand
you are shattering his ego.
Do you thin he will
be a mute spectator?
Do you think he will
not strategise against you?
I understand what you are saying,
Acharya.
But there has not been
any retaliation from him.
His silence is like the lull
before the storm.
When Dhananand breaks his silence
who knows what trouble
will come with that.
In this situation,
what is your opinion, Acharya?
How should we tackle this situation?
Queen, I have a solution
to every attack of Dhananand.
What is the solution, Acharya?
You have to marry Durdhara,
the sister of Dhananand.
What!
Marry Durdhara?
Yes. You have to marry Durdhara.
If you analyse minutely,
all the incidents
which happened with Dhananand
then you will come
to only one conclusion.
When it comes to Durdhara
then the mighty king Dhananand
who is armed to teeth
becomes helpless.
He becomes no less
than a hapless person.
Chandragupta,
consider that you have got hold
of the weakest point of your enemy.
In this entire world, it is Durdhara
for whom Dhananand can do anything.
If you use Durdhara as your weapon
then, you can change
the course of this battle.
By using Dhananand at your will
you will be successful
in uniting India.
Acharya.
If we keep aside the political gains
then it seems that
the way Chandragupta
is staring at Durdhara
the plan of yours will
be personally beneficial.
Am I right, Chandragupta?
Be it political or personal gain
I will not initiate
this plan till I get
a consent from Durdhara.
Do not worry about that.
I have already spoken to Durdhara.
Go and meet her in the garden.
In the garden?
Acharya..
Durdhara is right here.
There she is.
So..
It seems that Acharya
has already discussed
about the marriage.
Yes, he has spoken to me.
So..
I am just here to tell you
that if I do not have
your consent for this
you may refuse clearly.
You need not do this
solely to prove your integrity
and passion towards a united India.
Because I trust you.
Hence..
If you are against it, you may refuse.
I will speak to Acharya.
Based on whatever I have seen
I somehow feel
that Acharya does
not pay you much heed.
No.
Acharya Chanakya has
to pay me heed in this regard.
So, do I conclude that you
are not ready for this marriage?
I never said that.
But..
You did not give your consent, either.
In the last five years
I have been truly happy
and found peace of mind
only when I was with you.
Whenever there was rainfall
all I ever wished for
was that
we should enjoy those rains together.
Whenever I would
eat anything delicious
I would never enjoy its taste.
Because I used to think
that you were not alive.
But when I learnt
that you are alive
and are fighting endlessly
for your survival
it changed my world.
Every flower started
to look radiant and colourful.
Everything I tasted
seemed sweet to me.
And whenever you
addressed me as 'princess'
only then I felt like one.
So, do I assume this as your consent,
Princess?
When a bird learns to fly
it leaves its nest
even though that nest
is the safest place for it
which can give it
pleasure and happiness.
Similarly,
when a student acquires knowledge
he gives up the
seminary of his master.
Even though his fellow
students and friends are there
and he can rest peacefully there
away from the chaos of life,
but he has to leave.
For the development of existence
giving up all comfort and safety
and facing tough
situations is imperative.
Remember..
If you want to develop within
step out of your comfort zone
and learn to face the odds.
My ethics..
Your destiny.
I have an invitation for you,
Dhananand.
This is an invitation to
your dear sister, Princess Durdhara
and my disciple Chandragupta
Maurya's wedding.

================================================================================

Episode: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQpkGW14BQY

Chandragupta, you saw yourself
that Durdhara has given
her consent to this marriage.
It is time to start working
on the next phase of our plan.
You mean, wedding?
There are other ceremonies
before wedding.
Like, groom's side
inviting bride's side.
We will do the same.
That means you will send
an invitation to Dhananand
for Durdhara's and mine wedding.
Yes.
That is a good idea.
But there is a problem.
Do you think Dhananand
will come to his sister's wedding?
Especially when
she is marrying me, his enemy.
He will definitely come.
But to stop the wedding.
Dhananand used his cunning mind
and stopped the chiefs
of 14 districts of India
from coming to our grand celebration.
And that was a sound defeat for us.
Now you, his enemy,
marrying his dear sister
will give him the taste
of his own medicine.
And to make
the blow of this wedding
even more effective
this wedding will take place
in Piplivan's palace.
If we succeed in doing that,
Chandragupta
it would force Dhananand
to leave Magadh and come to war.
And then this war will be
fought on our terms.
Through your marriage to Durdhara
we will not just be hurting Dhananand
but it will also be
an inspirational message
to the chiefs of all
the districts of India
that if they can gather
a little courage and join us
in this revolutionary struggle,
they might also get free
from Dhananand's subjugation.
I believe, Acharya,
that you will have Durdhara
write this wedding invitation.
'King Dhananand, I want to meet you'
'in the forest near Magadh's border'
'but alone.'
'Durdhara.'
I hope Dhananand
recognises your handwriting.
Yes, Acharya.
Good.
But, Acharya
what will happen when
Dhananand comes there?
You should not worry about that.
Your Highness, the princess's
message clearly stated
that you must not bring soldiers.
What if seeing so many
soldiers creates a problem?
Amatya, King Dhananand gives orders
he does not follow
others' instructions.
And my dear sister
knows that very well.
In the message we received,
it was my sister's handwriting
but those words..
Those were not her words.
Those were the words
of her new friends.
I am very curious to know
why we got those instructions.
Soon we will know the motive
behind that, Your Highness.
Because we are about to reach
the place they mentioned.
Stop!
Your Highness, we are there.
Your Highness
look.
"Chanakya.."
"Chanakya.."
"Chanakya.."
"Chanakya.."
Chanakya!
I knew all this must have been planned
by this cunning Brahmin.
He is the root of all the problems.
Soldiers, burn him alive right here!
The road to my victory will
begin with his end.
Attack!
Dhananand
this fire is an unbending obstacle
between you and me.
It will stop you from reaching me.
At least until I give you
a special message.
The special message that
I want to deliver to you
face to face.
I have an invitation for you,
Dhananand.
Maybe your anger is making you
unable to read this
invitational message, Dhananand.
It is okay, as you are my old enemy
I will tell you
what is in the message.
Listen carefully, Dhananand.
This is an invitation
to your dear sister,
Princess Durdhara,
and my disciple
Chandragupta Maurya's wedding.
Time, full moon night.
Place, Piplivan's palace.
Chanakya!
- Careful, Dhananand!
Now, after this
take you next decision
after proper deliberation
otherwise..
With this raging fire
and the setting sun as my witnesses
I, King Dhananand declare that
within the next five days
that worm Chandragupta
and his army will be no more
along with his dream of united India
and his cunning teacher,
Acharya Chanakya!
That means
we only have 5 days
to conquer Piplivan.
But, Acharya, your move
has made Dhananand even angrier.
Undoubtedly.
Because that is also our intention.
And it will benefit us.
Remember, anger is an arrow
that hurts the wielder first
before hurting any other.
It is the poison
that destroys the vessel
that holds it.
And right now, Dhananand is angry.
What is it, Chandra?
I do now know.
It felt like someone was there.
Maybe it was just my imagination.
We do not have much time,
Chandragupta.
We have to make a lot of arrangements.
- Let us go.
- Okay, Acharya.
If we take this route
it will take us seven
and half hours to reach Piplivan.
I will go and inform the soldiers.
And I will also give them orders
to get ready for the journey.
Where are you going?
I just remembered, I have some work.
I will take care of it
and come back soon.
Hey.. How can you leave
in the middle of the planning?
1Wait here and listen to me carefully.
Sir, the planning can be paused
but not the nature's call.
What the heck! Fatso..
I know the reason
behind his sudden departure.
So you are the reason behind this..
I do not need much of your time.
I have only come to ask
what colour clothes
should I wear for our marriage?
You may wear whatever you wish.
Please forgive me.
I know, this marriage
will not be as well as your dreams.
But you are
going to become my wife.
So you have to understand that for me
my goals and my battles are
the most important things in my life.
Nothing is more important to me
more than the motherland
and it will always be that way.
Hence
being my life partner
you must support me
in the battles to come.
Sorry for the interruption.
I was looking for
a medicinal oil for my leg.
I will come later.
Wait.
I think, I have seen you before.
Me..
No.. I do not think
we have met me before anywhere.
Have you ever been
to Magadh or Patliputra?
No.. Never..
You must have seen someone else.
Durdhara, have you seen her before?
No.
Perhaps, I must have mistaken.
I am sure there is something
that she is hiding.
I must figure it out.
Where did she go?
'I cannot wait any longer.'
'Chandragupta is suspicious of me.'
'I hope, he does not learn
the truth about you and I.'
What happened?
You are shocked
as if you have been caught red-handed.
Shocking!
You could not even walk properly
till a little while ago.
Now, you are riding a horse.
Was this leg of yours not injured
for which you had come
in search of medicated oil?
I know that a different personality
is hiding behind
this calm, scared, weak looking female
who is scared of darkness
and you are fooling everyone
by pretending that
you have lost your memory.
Do not block my path.
Otherwise, I will not think
even for a second
before putting you down.
You will not be able to go from here
before introducing yourself.
Tell me, who are you?
- Otherwise..
- What otherwise?
Will you prove my identity
in front of everyone?
Go. Do what you want.
Only after knowing your real identity
I will decide whether
it would be advisable
to reveal it to everyone or not.
Do you want to know my truth?
Listen then.
I am not a weak and helpless girl.
Neither am I scared of darkness
nor do I get scared of any storm
because no storm in the world
is more dangerous
than the storm that
is residing in my heart.
There is some truth
related to your past
due to which you
are forced to lie today.
But no matter what it is
I will definitely find out about it.
- Princess Durdhara has been kidnapped?
- How did this happen?
- How did this happen?
- Yes, she has been kidnapped?
- Princess Durdhara has been kidnapped?
- How did this happen?
- How did this happen?
- How did this happen?
- Princess Durdhara has been kidnapped?
- How did this happen?
- Princess Durdhara has been kidnapped?
- How did this happen?
How did this happen?
What is all this, Amatya Rakshas?
Your Majesty, Chandragupta has invited
all the people to his wedding
to give them an evidence
of him being alive.
And this is the same invitation
that Chanakya had given to you.
Amatya, bring the funeral pyre out
that I had set up inside the palace.
I will drag that traitor out of Magadh
and burn him on the same funeral pyre
so that everyone present here
sees him burning.
As you say, Your Majesty.
I have just lit this lamp.
But it will last only for few minutes
or few hours.
After that, either its oil will dry up
or the wick will burn.
Or it can even go off before time
due to the heavy breeze.
Now, it depends on you
whether you keep worrying
about the life of this lamp
or you light more lamps
using this lamp
and make sure that there will not be
darkness in the room
in the absence of light.
Use your energy in finding
solutions for problems
instead of worrying
about the problems.
Life will be filled
with hope and not fear.
My ethics..
Your destiny.
Mahamatya. Give me that good news.
She did it, sire.
Good!
I am very happy with my pawn.

================================================================================

Episode: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVOfQ3Xb1_c

Stul.
Do you have some water?
I will give you.
Pardon me. But I cannot trust anyone
when it comes your security.
Because our plan
completely depends on you.
But, Chandra
Tarini is on our side.
It is fine, Queen Mura.
He must be cautious.
You cannot proceed further.
Before you stop us,
tell us who you are.
Chandragupta,
he is the king of Avanti.
Oh!
So, Acharya, he is one of those kings
who betrayed us.
He is one of those who
did not attend our festival
fearing for Dhananand inspite
of accepting the invitation.
It is good that you are now before us.
It is now time for you
to pay for all your deeds.
I did not challenge you for war.
I have come here to seek
from Acharya Chanakya.
My kingdom has got
attacked by an epidemic.
A lot of people have
already lost their lives.
I sent a message even
to Dhananand for help.
But he ignored us.
I heard that Acharya Chanakya
has the solution for this.
If you could help me,
I will always be obliged.
King, we invited you with all respect
but you did not attend our festival.
And now you here to seek help.
We will surely help you
on humanitarian grounds.
But you have come here
to seek help as a king
and when it comes to politics
it is about what you give and take.
You tell me.
What are we getting
by helping you today?
You are going towards Pimplivan.
Even my army will join you.
I will try to get you the support
of two more kingdoms.
Clean them properly. Make them shine.
I want my paintings to be installed
in every corner of Magadh
so that nobody even
forgets it even for a second
as to who their ruler is.
Only I should reflect in the actions
and thoughts of my subjects.
Sire..
Mahamatya.
Give me that good news.
She did it, sire.
Good!
Very good!
I am very happy with my pawn.
Go. Go soon.
Someone is looking for you.
What are you doing here?
Everyone is helping Acharya
in making the medicine
so that they can get Avanti
rid of the fear of death and you..
What are you doing here
all alone, Tarini?
And do not try to dodge
my questions this time.
Your hands smeared with royal ink..
It seems like you wrote
something just now.
What harm have I caused to you?
Why are you so suspicious about me?
What happened, Tarini?
Look, do not take me wrong.
You must be thinking
that I am scaring Tarini.
- But that is not true.
- It is fine, prince.
She gets scared very soon.
That is why we take care of her a lot.
Come, Tarini. Come with us.
Fresh marks of ink on your hands
and you looking up to the sky
clearly shows
that you just sent
a message to someone.
But, whom did you send it?
Everything is going as per my plan.
It is now time
for Chandragupta to be brought here
and be burned alive on this pyre.
For sure.
Chandragupta
your death is approaching you.
It seems like this epidemic is here
in this kingdom from a long time.
Acharya
I am sure that your medicine
will bring back lives to normal here.
It will induce life in them again.
Chandragupta,
show me that seed you had brought.
You all may proceed.
You do not have to stop.
Acharya, I know that
you have something to tell me.
You are right.
There is a lot happening here,
apart from the epidemic.
Just think of this.
This epidemic is here
in this kingdom since months
but they have sought our help now.
Why did they not do this before?
I am sure they are hiding something.
And I suspect
that Dhananand is behind all this.
But, Acharya,
if we do not help Avanti's king
and if our suspicion
turns out to be wrong
the people of this kingdom
and everyone else will think
that we turned back when
they needed us the most.
I have a solution to this.
Listen to my plan.
Sire, what are you doing?
Amatya, I was explaining these chefs
that the more you knead the dough
the tastier the 'Puris' will be.
The same is the case with torture.
The more you torture someone,
the more you enjoy it.
But why you have to dirty your hands?
We have a whole team of chefs.
I can get them changed
if you are not happy with their work.
No, Amatya
there is a different bliss
in preparing food with your hands
for a special guest.
Who is this special guest, sire?
I mean, for whom are you
preparing this royal food?
Stop.
Proceed.
Curiosity
is like
this beautiful 'Puri'.
But just one hole in it
spoils the whole fun.
Have some patience.
You will soon come to know
for whom we are preparing
this royal food.
We all thank you
for your help and hospitality.
But, like I have told you,
we are on a mission.
We have very less time
and the mission
has already got delayed
as we had to find the solution
for your kingdom's epidemic.'
Allow us to take your leave now.
Acharya, with your knowledge
and brilliance
you have made such a fertiliser
for our dying crops
that it is working now.
Very soon, my people will have
access to good food.
This is all because of you.
In order to express our gratitude
I have organised a feast for you.
We will also have the representatives
of the nearby kingdoms joining us.
I am sure those who did not get help
from Dhananand when in need
will consider the help
you have extended to us
and support you for this cause.
All right. We accept your invitation.
I am glad, Acharya.
We will proceed towards the palace
soon after Chandragupta comes back.
Chandragupta will be late.
He has gone to make a special fertiliser
for the maize crops of your kingdom.
What about Queen Durdhara?
Even she is not to be seen.
Queen Durdhara and Chandragupta
are going to enter a new chapter
of their lives soon.
So, they are spending
more time with each other.
Keep quiet..
Pardon me.
When it comes to hunger,
I am not normal like you.
I cannot control it.
Soon after hearing about the feast
I have become very impatient.
If you do not mind,
shall we proceed for the feast?
Chandra will join us soon.
Sure.
Commander-in-chief,
inform the royal chefs immediately
that Acharya Chanakya, Chandragupta
and his comrades
have accepted our invitation
and that they will be having
dinner at palace tonight.
As you command, Your Highness.
I will inform them right away.
Commander-in-chief of Avanti's army..
Thank you for your message.
Now taste this sweet dish and tell me
how it is.
No, Your Highness! I am fine.
Let it be.
You need not be so scared.
Not at all!
I will not feed contaminated food
to Chandragupta and his comrades.
I will make them have tasty food.
Something which they have
never tasted in their lives.
Take it.
Fulfill the command of the king.
Your Highness, this is very tasty.
Amazing!
Very good!
It has to be very sweet.
Because
this is the last meal of their lives.
Durdhara..
At times, I think
you are more courageous than I am.
Today, you are even got ready
to walk on this rough path
after sacrificing
your luxurious life.
Thank you, Durdhara.
I am sure, everyone thinks
that I have taken this
rough path because of you
and for the feelings you have for me.
But the truth is, I am doing this
as a part of repentance
which I will have for life
that I supported the evil,
knowingly or unknowingly.
Do you know what?
Mother always tells me
that the respect
is the biggest feeling
she has for my father.
And today
I have got this feeling of respect
towards you, Durdhara.
Prince Chandragupta,
welcome to Avanti.
Princess Durdhara,
thank you for coming here.
Please enter the palace with me.
We have arranged royal dinner
in your hospitality.
Every dish of this dinner
has been specially made
by our special chefs.
I am happy tell you
that the sweet dish
has turned out to be
very tasty this time.
Let me carry this fertiliser.
No, that is not needed.
I will show this fertiliser
to Acharya Chanakya first.
Because I can handover this
to you only after his inspection.
Sure. I understand.
Please come inside.
Your comrades are waiting for you.
What happened?
You will never get rid
of your typical princess mind.
Tell me something.
Do you not think that it is unusual
for a commander-in-chief
to know so much about the dishes?
He is a commander-in-chief.
How can he know how
tasty the sweet dish is?
Yes, you are right.
There is something cooking here,
apart from the food.
Then what is your plan now?
I do not have time for all this now.
Just do what I say.
Come.
Come.
Welcome to the dinner.
Guests, please take your seats.
Thank you for allowing
my chefs to serve you.
Why is it so hot here?
Because all the doors
and windows here are shut.
What happened?
I hope everything here
is as per your comfort.
King of Avanti, it is too hot here.
If you could get the doors
and windows opened
the wind can pass here
and bring down the temperature.
Oh! Pardon me.
But I was the one who got them shut
so that the insects flying around
do not contaminate your food.
You must be knowing
that they are the cause
for the epidemic here.
But you do not worry.
I will be right back.
Did you see that?
You were getting
worried unnecessarily.
He cares for us so much.
Let us just enjoy the food now.
Stulbhhadra, the epidemic here
was not due to air
but water insects.
Even the king of Avanti knows this.
What?
Does that mean he was lying to us?
And, have they shut
these windows and doors
to capture us?
That is what it seems like.
Then why are we still here? Let us go.
Be seated.
Acharya
I do not see any other
state representatives here.
Could this be a conspiracy?
Calm down.
Do not give any reaction at this time.
Let us join this game.
Let us play this until
the main player of this game
comes before us.
But who is he?
Dhananand.
Everything is ready, Your Highness.
The whole team of Chanakya
and Chandragupta
are in the dining hall.
My commander-in-chief just informed me
that even Chandragupta and Durdhara
are on their way to the palace.
So, do you still believe
that I was not bothered
about the epidemic of your region?
No, Your Highness. Please forgive me.
It was my mistake.
In fact,
everything is now clear to me.
In spite of having enmity
with Chanakya
you got me his help
in solving my problem.
I know that he has knowledge
but with your wisdom,
you got my work done.
There is none like you.
It will be a privilege to rule under
your able leadership not only for me
but for all the other chiefs.
Appreciation!
I love it.
But I cannot take all the credit
of what will happen here tonight.
Half of its credit goes to the one
who was once a confidant
of Chandragupta and who is now
my trusted one.
The credit of whatever
will happen today
will go to the
person that was faithful
to Chandragupta but now
he is faithful to me.
Come in..
If he
did not tell me
about everything that happened
I would
have not been able to plan
my enemies' death.
That is why, he gets half the credit
for whatever is happening today
and whatever will happen in future.
Mahamatya.
Yes, Your Majesty.
You just have one work left to do
that is, giving me
my sister, Durdhara.
After that you can live in any part
of Magadh that you want.
Thank you very much
for your mercy and grace.
Mahamatya
I hope that all my soldiers
are ready to welcome
our guest tonight.
Yes, Your Majesty.
Everything is happening
according to the plan.
Good.
Come on.
Let us begin the feast of death.
Oh, my God!
You had so many weapons!
Why did you not tell me?
Answer me.
I did not want you to get worried.
What else have you not told me?
I am going to leave you here.
You cannot do that.
I am coming with you.
Durdhara, trust me.
I am doing this for your own good.
You staying here
will be good for everyone.
I would have told you
everything in detail
if we had time.
Forgive me.
Chandra.. Listen to me.
Chandra..
- Chandra!
- Calm down
or our plan will fail.
Acharya was right.
Something is definitely going on.
That is why, all the doors
of dinning hall are closed.
What is going on here?
I need to find out.
This..
So many gold coins..
It is good that I found you here.
I was going to Acharya.
I was going to tell him that I found
these coins in Tarini's luggage.
She is definitely hiding
something from us.
How did she get so many gold coins?
You were right.
It is important to keep an eye on her.
Nothing feels right especially
when she is with Durdhara.
Oh, my God.
Is Princess Durdhara
with her in the kitchen?
No. She is not there.
She is safe.
I have locked her in the armoury.
Go fast and take part in the feast.
And yes, keep an eye on Tarini
I have some work to do.
- Forgive me.
- No problem.
They do not seem like
they have ever served food.
You are right.
They are not good at serving food
because they are not servents.
They are soldiers.
What?
Look at their behaviour carefully.
It seems like they are using weapons
instead of serving food.
Calm down, Stulbhadra. Calm down.
Do not give a reaction.
Calm down.
They are working for Dhananand.
If they doubt us
we will not be able to
find out Dhananand's plan.
Things would get worse for us.
That is why, stay silent.
Go with the flow.
We are surrounded by enemies
and you want us
to stay quiet?
Do not worry.
They will not do anything
till Dhananand arrives.
There is still some
time till he comes.
You will soon die, Chandragupta.
- I have to go from here.
- Sit down.
If you leave right now,
you will attract everyone's attention.
And Dhananand might
succeed in his ploy.
That is why, sit down. Okay?
But what can we do in so less time?
Do this, Stulbhadra.
I will ask them to serve you liquor.
And you have to drop as much
of the liquor as you can.
Listen.
Please serve Avanti's famous
wine to my friends.
Where are you, Chandra?
Oh! It is you.
I thought it was some enemy.
Princess, your guess was right.
Enemies are waiting in ambush
everywhere in this palace.
That means Chandragupta's guess
was absolutely right.
Some conspiracy is afoot here.
Yes, Chandragupta sent me here
to ensure your safety.
Dhananand has laid traps
in every direction to catch us.
Look, it is not the time to think.
Do not worry.
Chandragupta has
thought of everything.
You just have to come with me.
Let us go.
Friend, I have not had such wine
even in Takshashila or Magadh. Right?
- Can I get some more?
- Sure..
Friend, some more wine.
No, you will not get more wine.
What do you mean?
The king of Avanti
has hosted this feast for us.
And you are refusing us!
Your game is over.
You came straight
to get caught in my trap, Chanakya.
Maybe your deep thinking and wisdom
could not save you from my trap.
Dhananand, it seems that with time
your here, there and everywhere
kind of mind is weakening.
That is why your eyes
are not able to see
what is clearly visible.
See! Do you see
Chandragupta or your dear sister,
Durdhara, anywhere?
You said that Chandragupta is here.
Where is he?
In a few days
this plant will start
taking root in earth.
And then
it will produce beautiful
and fragrant flowers.
But if for some reason it
does not produce flowers
or if the flowers are deformed
will you blame the plant
and pull it out?
Or will you first inspect the ground
in which the plant took root?
To see if the problem
is with the ground.
To see if there is termite
or other insects present,
which are harming the plant.
To see if it lacks water or light.
That is why,
it is not right to blame someone else
for your failure in life.
We should closely examine
and assess the situation.
Because often we understand the root
of the problem after it has arisen.
And only then can we find a solution.
My ethics..
Your destiny.
They are all my old enemies.
Who is this
new one among them?

================================================================================

Episode: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YS1CbQin8Qg

Look! Can you see Chandragupta
or your dear sister, Durdhara, here?
You had said that
Chandragupta is here.
Where is that boy?
What are you thinking about, fools?
Kill them all!
We have to save Princess Durdhara.
Come with me!
Excellent!
So, another warrior has joined them.
They are all my old enemies.
Who is this
new one among them?
I am very eager to know that.
'Such a dangerous fire!'
'I am sure it was set by Chandragupta
and Chanakya.'
'I wonder who is
dominating the fight.'
'I am unable to understand anything.'
'But if I take Durdhara
there at this time'
'the tide of the battle may turn.'
Chandragupta and others are in danger.
We should go and help them. Come on.
No, Princess.
It is dangerous to go there.
Come with me.
No, we should help Chandragupta.
Listen to me, Princess.
I am following my orders.
I have been tasked
with your protection.
That is why I request you
to listen to me.
All right?
Come on.
Come with me..
Where are you going
after leaving me here?
Because Chandragupta had
asked me to meet him here.
He had said that
he would take you from here.
Stay here and do not go anywhere.
I will go to help others.
Take all of them and leave safely.
- I will help Chandragupta.
- Yes, Acharya.
Come on..
Chandragupta!
Take Durdhara out of here.
You know where we have to meet.
Search the entire palace.
The princess is in this palace. Go!
Come with me!
'I had closed the door of this room.'
Durdhara?
Where are you, Durdhara?
Why have you kept me here,
Chandragupta?
What is your plan?
Your Highness,
Are you all right?
Do not pretend.
Go and close all the
exits of your palace.
Today, not even one of them
should escape alive.
And find my sister.
By now, my spy should have
brought my sister here.
Is someone here? Save me!
Durdhara?
Acharya!
Durdhara is not in the armoury.
I just heard her screaming.
I saw Tarini looking for Durdhara.
'Why do I feel'
'that I have seen you somewhere?'
'No.. I do not think you could
have seen me anywhere before today.'
'Have you ever gone
to Magadh or Pataliputra?'
'No, never. You must have
seen someone else.'
'Move from my way.'
'Otherwise, I will not hesitate
to trample upon you.'
'Tell me. Who are you?'
- 'Otherwise..
- So what?'
'Will you reveal
my truth to everyone?'
'Go. You can do whatever you want.'
'Why do you have so many gold coins?'
'It is good that I found you here,
Chandragupta.'
'I was going to Acharya.'
'I have to tell him that I found
these gold coins in Tarini's luggage.'
I do not trust Tarini, Acharya.
Durdhara is in danger.
Fool! I had asked you
to bring my sister to me!
I had brought her here, Your Highness.
I had asked her to stay here.
I wonder..
Look at this!
Look at this, Your Highness.
She was here.
But it seems that someone
came here and took her along.
I will kill you right away,
insignificant being!
I made a mistake
by letting you live.
I should have killed you
the day you came to me.
But if you love your life
then find my sister!
If I do not find my sister
I will not spare you.
Yes, Your Highness.
Move towards the southern gate
with your army.
I will find the princess
and bring Chandragupta
and his army there.
Then you can capture them all at once.
Chandra,
you are suspecting Tarini uselessly.
Why do you not trust that poor woman?
She is not innocent!
Durdhara?
Durdhara!
Are you all right?
Yes. Because of Tarini
I am all right.
Chandragupta,
this is not the right time to talk.
We are surrounded by danger.
- We have to leave now.
- Yes, Acharya.
Let us leave by the northern gate.
That will not be useful.
That gate has been closed.
I just saw it.
Troops have been deployed there.
I think we should go
to the southern gate.
The southern gate?
Do you believe that
we can escape from there?
Yes, Acharya.
Come with me. Come.
How far is the southern gate?
Just a few moments more,
Your Highness.
Here.. We have to go
in this direction.
Durdhara.
Why are you behaving like this?
Leave my hand.
What is this?
You made the mistake
yet you are being angry.
Why did you leave from the place
where I had asked you to stay?
Do you know
how worried I was after not
seeing you in the armoury?
Enough, Chandragupta.
I am not a puppet
that you can direct me
however you want.
It was my mistake
to follow your orders.
Wait a minute.
My orders? When did you follow it?
Really? Did I not follow your orders?
But I did follow the orders
of the man you sent.
Mahisha told me
that you had asked me
to move from the armoury.
Do you even realise
that if Tarini had not arrived on time
what would have happened to me?
No, you do not realise it
because you have become blind to it.
You are only concerned
about your goal and plan.
You are not concerned about me.
'It is good that I found you here,
Chandragupta.'
'I was going to Acharya.'
'I have to tell him that I found
these gold coins in Tarini's luggage.'
'Are you all right?
'Yes.'
'I am all right because of Tarini.'
It means Dhananand's spy
and our enemy is not Tarini
but Mahisha!
He is giving Dhananand
all our information.
You are about to die, Chandragupta.
This is the southern gate, Acharya.
Mahisha..
We will need horses. Go and get them.
In the meanwhile,
I will open the door.
All of you come with me.
Chandragupta! What are you doing?
Acharya, we have been trapped
using an elaborate plan.
Dhananand can come here
at any moment.
It is impossible for us
to leave together.
That is why we have to stop Dhananand.
For that, we need to entice him.
I will be that enticement.
Leave from here, Acharya! Hurry up!
All right. But remember!
The enemies have to fall apart!
My India has to remain united
and great!
We will meet soon.
What have you done?
I did the right thing.
I betrayed the betrayer.
Mahisha, I know
that you are
Dhananand's spy.
It brings sorrow, does it not?
It hurts
when someone close to you betrays you.
Chandragupta!
I am satisfied to know
you are feeling the same pain
that I felt due to my sister.
She left me
and chose you.
Mahisha, you did
all this for money, did you not?
Yes, because not everyone
is as foolish as you are,
Chandragupta.
Some people know
the value of money.
They know that money can make
the world bow before them.
Moreover, I had
given him pure gold
from my special treasure.
How could you do this, Mahisha?
How could you sell your conscience?
For a few gold coins,
you sold your loyalty
and your motherland!
Answer me, Mahisha!
Why did you do this?
Who are you to lecture me?
You are a prince.
If you had spent half your life
in that deep and dark prison like me
you would have understood
what hunger is!
Those who live such a hard life
value material comforts.
To that person,
money is much more important
than battles, Chandragupta.
I agree that I was born as a prince.
But since my childhood
I have lived as a slave.
Perhaps, you are forgetting something.
The dark and deep prison
that you are talking about..
I had spent five years
of my life there.
The path we take and our character
are determined by our choice
and not situations.
Mahisha, you still have time.
You can still choose the right path.
Do you know, Mahisha?
Even if I die today
I will not be unhappy.
Because I have chosen the dignity
of my motherland.
But now, your choice
depends on you.
Do you accept to die with self-respect
or do you want to live
with the stigma of being a traitor?
After listening to your speech
my heart is melting.
But do not worry, my friend.
When you live in the special room
in Magadh
I will permit you to visit
the Magadh prison sometimes.
You can go
and witness his pitiful state.
Because his death is
going to be as terrible
as his life has been.
Perhaps, then you will not be jealous
that you were not born a prince.
Am I right?
Indeed, Your Highness.
There is only one way to end this.
He will not die, but you will.
Hey!
Mahisha..
Mahisha, what did you do?
You had asked me
to choose Chandragupta.
So now I have chosen.
It is better to die with pride
rather than leading
a disgraceful life.
Thank you, Chandragupta.
You showed me the right path,
Chandragupta.
You will be an inspiration
for the future generation.
For many ages to come
people will follow your values.
Mahisha..
Chandra..
Hail Lord Ram..
This is now a big problem,
Chandragupta.
Now I will have to
kill that inspiration
because of whom
all this has started.
So that no one can
ever revolt against me.
What are you looking at, boy?
Witness the way I put an end to you
and the flame of rebellion
that you are harbouring.
Arrest him!
Durdhara, think again.
I have, Queen Mura.
There is a river about
100 steps away from here.
You will find a boat there.
You are not leaving.
Acharya, there is only one way
to keep Chandra alive
and it is I.
If I go to King Dhananand
then he will keep Chandra alive.
I request you.
Let me go.
Yes, Acharya.
If Dhananand listens to anyone
then it is only Durdhara.
If we do not make this effort
he will surely kill Chandra.
Dhananand will not do it.
He will take Chandragupta to Magadh
but he will keep him alive.
After that
he will invite the residents of Magadh
and kill Chandragupta
in front of them.
He will do it to make them fear him.
Amatya, the subjects of Magadh
are receiving too many invitations
nowadays, right?
Earlier, they were reading
the invitation message
of my sister and Chandragupta's
wedding with a great interest.
Now, send them
an invitation on my behalf.
Invite them to the funeral
of Chandragupta.
Ask them to attend the event
with their entire family.
Aged persons, kids..
Everyone is invited.
Inform them that
a grand feast will be held
after Chandragupta's last rites.
And everyone should attend the event
in white attire.
Even they should know
how their emperor
executes traitors.
First of all, he will be paraded
in the lanes of Magadh
in a cage.
After that, he will be executed
in the crossroads of Pataliputra.
After that
I myself will light his pyre.
Your Highness,
your every order will be executed.
Acharya, we should stop the emperor
if he is taking Chandra to Magadh.
This is our only chance.
Because our problems
will be increased further
once he reaches Magadh.
Do not worry, Durdhara.
Acharya will find a way for sure.
God knows
what Chandra is going through now.
No..
Amatya, I am not enjoying it much.
I can still see courage
and arrogance in his eyes.
Do something to shatter his arrogance.
Okay, Your Highness.
I will enjoy torturing him.
'There must be a way to ensure
that you keep your word'
'and do not commit the sin
of killing a Brahmin.'
'Only Amatya can tell us about this.'
'Please increase our knowledge.'
'If you cut the plait of a Brahmin'
'it is considered as
a killing of a Brahmin.'
'I like this, Amatya Rakshas.'
Amatya Rakshas, very good!
Now, I have understood
why you are known as Amatya Rakshas.
You will break down for sure.
You will break down for sure.
I will shatter your courage.
Calm down.
Acharya asked us to assemble here,
right?
This means, he has a plan.
Chandra will be with us very soon.
Is everyone present here?
Yes, Acharya.
Listen to me carefully.
My plan is that we will
march towards Piplivan now
without any break.
But Acharya
the future of united India
depends on Chandragupta.
How can you order us
to march towards Piplivan
instead of freeing Chandra?
Queen Mura, Chandragupta
is destined to protect others.
The one who is born to protect others
does not need any help
to protect himself.
Chandragupta himself will find
a solution of this problem.
I selected Chandragupta as
the future emperor of united India.
Chandragupta worked very hard
and trained religiously for years
to make himself the
ideal choice for the throne.
And he has become invincible.
There is no weapon in India
which can defeat him.
- But Acharya..
- Enough!
I don't want to hear anything.
Do you remember our goal?
Our goal is to dethrone Dhananand
and build a united India.
Had Chandragupta been present here
he would have said the same
that we should march towards Piplivan
instead of freeing him.
Hence, we will march towards Piplivan.
Dhananad has created this trouble.
We cannot help him to succeed
in his plan by waiting here.
Okay.
We will do what Acharya is saying.
Get ready
to march towards Piplivan.
Princess Durdhara.
You have proven to be
very brave during
this tough situation.
I
neither have any experience,
nor much knowledge
regarding love and all.
But I know
that if we truly love someone
then it makes us stronger not weak.
He is right.
Many times, love bounds us.
It bounds us to give up.
We should not let this happen to us.
W-We should get ready to leave.
Do not forget my words, Chandragupta.
This is our motherland
and we are its children.
You will get the solutions
for all your problems
in that land itself.
It will protect you.
It will protect.
Chandragupta.
You are aware of every nook
and corner of this forest.
And I am very sure
that you will safely return soon
by wisely using your knowledge
and training of many years.
We all will have to leave
for Piplivan at the earliest.
No one will stop anywhere.
The enemy may be waiting
for us anywhere.
Do not worry, Durdhara.
I have seen Chandragupta fighting.
Nothing will happen to him.
He is a true warrior.
You have seen Chandragupta,
but not my brother.
I chose Chandra over him
which has hurt his ego.
And he will definitely
take its revenge from him.
He will cross all
the limits of cruelty.
You do not know my brother
and his cruelty.
Who can know his cruelty more than me?
I mean
I saw him destroying Piplivan.
That is why I can predict
that how cruel he can be.
Tarini.
I thought you have lost your memory.
Tarini, is there anything
that you want to tell us all?
Just that some wounds never heal.
Best wishes for your target.
But I am sorry
I cannot be with you any further.
It is okay, Tarini.
We can understand, you are a victim
of a very painful past.
You were with us till here
and protected my people.
Thank you very much for that.
We will never forget your favours.
Your Majesty.
You should not have let
her go just like that.
My people trust her
and I trust the one
whom my people trust.
Right.
We all will head towards Piplivan now.
We will form two teams.
Her Majesty Mura and Princess Durdhara
will lead one team.
The other team
will follow me and Stul.
Let me remind this again.
No one will stop anywhere.
Come on.
I will take you with me
at any cost today.
Then even your brother
will get to know
whether I deserve respect or insult.
'Oh, Motherland.'
'I will not die, until I free you'
'from Dhananand.'
'This is my oath that I will fight'
'till my last breathe.'
'Please do not get disappointed.'
'Please show me a path.'
It will not be very difficult for you
to lift this half-filled sack.
But as the weight of this sack
will keep increasing
it will keep becoming difficult
for you to lift it.
And in that case, if you
do not take anyone's help to lift it
then either you will be crushed by it
or you will be injured.
And if none of these happens
your speed will still become slow.
A true leader is the one
who knows it very well
that how much responsibility
he should carry
and how much responsibility
he should assign to others.
Remember.
The appropriate division
and distribution or tasks
is the identity of a best
and an excellent leader.
And if you do not have this quality
then you will never be able
to meet your target.
My ethics..
Your destiny.
Neither Chandragupta or Chanakya
are there to protect them.
Before they reach Piplivan
we will surround them and kill them.
Get back. This is landslide.

================================================================================

Episode: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9krUfnPl8Bw

Halt!
Your Highness,
a landslide has taken place.
The path is closed.
We need to stop here.
Acharya, you said,
we're heading towards Piplivan.
But we've come at the end of a cliff.
And now,
you're making me throw boulders.
Acharya, it would have been better
if we had made an attempt
to save Chandra.
I am not able to grasp your strategy.
Those who understand my strategy,
Stulbhadra..
They will very well know what I am planning.
'Landslide never takes place
on this mountain because of rain'
'then how come it happened today.'
'That means this is
surely Acharya's plan.'
Your Highness,
our path has been blocked.
We need to wait here
or we have to take a detour.
But that route is quite lengthy,
Your Highness.
Do you have a hand
in whatever is happening here?
Yes.
Don't you know?
Actually, I have direct contact
with Lord Indra.
I requested him and he got
rainfall on this mountain.
And this landslide took place
because of that.
I am the future king of India
so I should be having
such direct contacts. Right?
How can you play joke
even in this situation?
Good!
We will take the long route
but will surely reach Magadh today.
Before sunset I will
burn your dead body.
Amaty, get this blocked path cleared
as soon as possible.
And if you reach Magadh before me
then make preparation of future king
- of undivided India.
- Yes, Your Highness.
Good. The rain has stopped.
Acharya, you're making us
run from everywhere.
Please tell me
what is going on in your mind.
Stulbhadra,
have you ever given it a thought
why do you feel hungry so much?
Acharya,
what does hunger has to do with this?
There is a reason.
Look.. You talk a lot.
While talking too much,
you lose out on energy.
When you lose energy,
you crave for food.
I mean to say,
speak only when necessary.
That would be beneficial for you.
This landslide which we have
created for the person
he will come to know
why we have done this.
'If Acharya is helping me'
'then I will have to do something
as soon as possible.'
Imbecile!
So, now we do not know
for whom we will wait here.
But we need to wait
because Acharya has ordered!
Maybe.. Maybe we are waiting
for the darkness to fall.
So that the wild animals
of the jungles devour us.
Acharya, instead of dying like this
I am ready to die
while saving Chandragupta.
But this way..
Acharya..
Chandragupta!
Stulbhadra, as I had said
the landslide for whom I had planned
he will definitely understand
this strategy of mine.
You made a good effort, Chanakya!
But this time, none of your moves
will be successful.
Today, the death of this pest
is imminent.
Drag him up!
Soldiers of Magadh.
Let us bring back our princess.
Show King Dhananand that you al
are the best soldiers in the army.
Our attack will be fast and deft.
In a flash, we will defeat the enemy.
But this time, we will be confronting
some women who are weak and hapless.
Right..
Durdhara and Mura
are no match for men like us.
That is because neither Chandragupta
or Chanakya are there to protect them.
Before they reach Piplivan
we will surround them and kill them.
Soldiers!
Raise your swords and shields!
Let us go, soldiers!
Acharya Chanakya,
what made you come here at his hour..
All of a sudden?
Is everything okay?
Chief Jaganna.
I need your help.
I need some youths from your village.
Years back
you had saved the Bandhi village
from the atrocities of Dhananand.
'Innocent people of the village
of Bandhi.. Leave!'
'Let us deal with these soldiers.'
Because of you and Chandragupta,
we are alive.
We are ready to help you.
My entire village is ready to help you.
You only need to give the orders.
Attack!
Stop!
Soldiers..
No need to shed blood.
I just came to tell
that I want back Durdhara.
Stop, Ambikumar!
Dare a foul person like you
take the name of Durdhara!
She is the pride of Piplivan now.
Before you come near her
you have to fight
the Queen the Piplivan!
- Soldiers! Attack!
- Attack!
Durdhara!
Enough of fighting, Durdhara.
I know that you were in grief
without my presence.
Look at yourself..
The way Chandragupta has treated you.
Come with me.
I will give you a life
befitting a queen.
- Come.
- No.
At any cost, I will not come with you.
I said, come with me, Durdhara!
Tarini?
- Who are you!
- Your death.
Come on, Durdhara.
Let us show him today
that a woman's heart is soft
but she is strong.
If a woman has the ability
to give birth to someone
then she also has the ability
to kill someone.
We have to teach them
such a lesson today
which they can never
forget in their life.
Let us show them today that a woman
is not just a showpiece.
She has her own existence
and her own identity.
Hey! Enough of your speech.
Soldiers! Attack!
Accept your destiny Chandragupta.
It is impossible for you
to survive now.
Acharya..
Chandragupta!
Stop, Mother-in-law!
Let him go.
He deserves to live
a life of a cowards.
Brother will insult him every day.
He deserves that.
It will be an honour for him
to get killed by
a brave woman like you.
Get out of here
before we change our mind
and kill you. Get out!
What happened, Mother-in-law?
You called me mother-in-law
for the first time today.
I hope you are all right, Chandra.
Careful, Dhananand!
You wanted to kill me today, right?
Look, I can kill you right away.
But I will not do that.
I will spare you.
I will give you such a gift
which will be even more
dangerous than death.
Today, you all will
witness such a scene
which you can never forget.
His Highness himself will bring
that traitor Chandragupta
in front of you.
[Indistinct chatter]
[Indistinct chatter]
[Indistinct chatter]
Sire.
Such cndition of Your Highness.
[Indistinct chatter]
[Indistinct chatter]
Soldiers, move fast.
Who can do this with the king?
Who else but only Chandragupta
can do this?
Only he has that capability
and bravery.
He had sent invitation
to all of us of his
and princess's wedding.
This must surely be Chandragupta.
With this humiliation of Dhananand
the first step of our plan
is successful, Chandragupta.
And the second step of his humiliation
will begin now.
Hail Chandragupta!
Hail Chandragupta!
Hail Maurya dynasty!
Hail Maurya dynasty!
Hail Maurya dynasty!
Hail Chandragupta!
Hail Maurya dynasty!
We have to keep the momentum
of this revolution going.
We have to stoke this fire
of united India even further.
It will be so, Chandragupta.
This day will never be forgotten
by the people of Magadh
and the king of Magadh.
The memories of this day
will haunt Dhananand forever.
'Hail Chandragupta!
Hail Maurya dynasty!'
'Hail Chandragupta!
Hail Maurya dynasty!'
'Hail Chandragupta!
Hail Maurya dynasty!'
'Hail Chandragupta!
Hail Maurya dynasty!'
'Hail Chandragupta!
Hail Maurya dynasty!'
I have two swords.
One is so sharp that it can destroy
the enemy in one stroke.
The other one is rusty.
The reason?
This sword was sharpened
from time to time.
It was kept sheathed when not needed.
But this one..
No one cared for its maintenance.
The same way
loyalty and faithfulness
are also like a sword.
If you are good to someone
you will have their
loyalty for lifetime
which can save you from any danger.
But if you ruin your relation
with someone through misconduct
then slowly the rust of unfaithfulness
starts taking that relation
which could become
the cause of your destruction.
That is why, always be respectful
to those loyal to you.
Because loyalty is something
you cannot buy with money.
My ethics..
Your deestiny.
We have reached the fort,
looking for mother and Durdhara
but they are nowhere to be seen.
Acharya, this dagger..
This is mother's dagger.
But how can it be here?
They have been imprisoned.

================================================================================

Episode: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3gU12CoqPw

The time has come to establish
my rule over Piplivan
and give Dhananand another shock.
What is the matter, Acharya?
What are you thinking about?
Chandra, I can understand that
it is an emotional matter for you
to free Piplivan from Dhananand's rule
and attain a victory there.
- But..
- But I should not have individual goals.
That is it, right?
Acharya
there is no doubt that it will be
a delight to get Piplivan its freedom
and free my house
and kingdom from Dhananand.
But I have a huge motive behind this.
Victory in Piplivan will give more power
to the revolution of uniting India.
Think about it.
Dhananand uses Piplivan
as a symbol of his greatest victory.
He had established his power
on the entire nation
after winning that.
If Piplivan is taken from him
a message will be given
to the entire country.
That good always triumphs over evil.
By doing this
we will begin the destruction
of Dhananand's empire.
By establish our rule over Piplivan
we will help the poor and the weak.
We will open a door for them!
We will tell them about
the objective and importance
of an united India.
Just wait and watch, Acharya.
Piplivan will emerge as a place
where there will be unity and peace.
There will be no fear or tyranny.
This humiliation of Dhananand will be
as good as our victory
after the unification
of kingdoms Takshashila
and Paurav Kingdom.
Think about it.
What would that Dhananand
be doing now?
He must be closing every
single door of his palace
to block out the sound
that has taken home in his heart
in his mind and in his soul.
You will not find peace anywhere now,
Dhananand.
We will not stop now.
We will never stop!
'Hail Maurya dynasty!
Hail Chandragupta!'
'Hail Maurya dynasty!
Hail Chandragupta!'
We should not stop the momentum
of victory now, Acharya.
Our journey of victory
will never halt.
Why are you smiling?
Chandragupta, I am smiling
because you have forgotten
about a personal victory
in this victory.
I am forgetting something?
What is it?
What could be more personal to me
than uniting our motherland
and making an united India?
Acharya
I never thought it will be so difficult
to find a headdress in Patliputra!
What is that, Stulbhadra?
This is what most grooms
wear on their wedding.
- Wedding?
- Yes, Chandragupta.
This is the personal victory
I was talking about.
After your victory over this palace
all the obstructions to yours
and Durdhara's wedding are gone.
So I want you to take joy
of your personal victory
after this victory.
Amazing!
I had heard a lot
about this great palace
but I never imagined
it would be so divine and grand.
Look at it properly, Durdhara.
That is your new house.
And soon
you will be the queen of the palace.
I thought soldiers would be stationed
for protection of the palace.
But there is no one here.
Praise the Queen.
We have searched in all directions.
There is no guard here.
Even so,
we have to move forward carefully.
Okay.
'It is your responsibility to
take care of Piplivan's future, Mura.'
'Go!'
'Get Chandra ready.'
'If anything happens to me'
'he has to gain his kingdom back.'
'He will have to come back
to take revenge for his father.'
'And he will do so.'
King Chandravardhan,
I am back at my home.
Your son will soon
come back to his home.
Let us go, Your Majesty.
Let us prepare the palace
for the welcome of its prince.
Soldiers, arrest them.
There is too many of them.
We cannot fight them.
'You wanted to kill me today, right?'
'Look, I can kill you right now.'
'But I will not do that.'
'I will let you live.'
'I will give you a gift
worse than death.'
'Hail Maurya kingdom!
Hail Chandragupta!'
Hey! How dare you
hail my enemy's name!
And you!
You are also in league
with my enemies. Right?
No, Your Highness.
W-We did not hail anyone's name.
- Do you mean to say I am lying?
- No, Your Highness.
Move!
Your Highness, wait.
Calm down, Your Highness.
None of them hailed
Chandragupta's name.
All of them are loyal to you.
They are your soldiers.
They would not dare
to do something like that.
I think you imagined it.
And about Chandragupta..
We will take revenge
for your humiliation.
Insulting you means insulting Magadh.
Insulting Magadh means
that Chandragupta's death.
We will give him such a death,
Your Highness
that all those who hailed
his name will be left shaken.
This world will know
the consequence of going
against King Dhananand!
Just calm down, Your Highness.
Stop Chandragupta, Your Highness.
Your Highness! Your Highness!
That Chandragupta is advancing
towards Piplivan with his army.
After reaching there, he is going
to marry Princess Durdhara.
If anyone can stop him, it is you.
- Please stop him.
- Move!
Give me whatever punishment you want,
Your Highness.
But stop this wedding.
You cannot let him live.
You have to take revenge from him.
Revenge?
Do you want to die? Yes?
Do you want to die? Move!
Punish me, Your Highness, punish me.
But please stop him.
You are the most powerful king
in this nation.
How can Chandragupta win against you?
Your Highness that fool thinks
he can win against you in war.
But he has no idea that
you have the army of 14 districts.
He cannot win against you,
Your Highness.
You are right.
I have the force of 14 districts.
Now that worm will see my power.
My power, Magadh's power!
Acharya, it is so strange.
We have reached the fort,
looking for mother and Durdhara
but they are nowhere to be seen.
Chandragupta,
do you remember it properly?
Did you ask the queen
to meet you here?
Yes, Acharya, and you know
that mother never changes a plan.
What happened here? Where are they?
Acharya, this dagger..
This is mother's dagger.
But how can it be here?
Chandra.
This is Durdhara's ornament.
Chandragupta,
they have been imprisoned.
Look at these footsteps.
These are the footsteps of soldiers.
Stop, Chandragupta.
We will free Queen Mura
and the would be queen of Piplivan.
And we will enter this palace.
But not using the path
the enemy knows.
But rather using the way
only the prince of Piplivan knows.
On a moonlit night came the prince.
'Darkness everywhere
and light in only once place.'
A traveler caught in the game of morning
and evening surrounded by the path.
In the morning,
he is a traveler of evening.
In one month, he is surrounded.
Inform King Dhananand immediately
that we have not only
found Princess Durdhara
but also captured this slave, Mura.
Fool! She is not a slave.
She is the queen of this fort.
Talk to her with respect!
Excuse me.
Can you please pass
my message as well?
What kind of sound is that?
Guards. Go and check what is going on.
Acharya, let us go.
Tarini.
I have seen very less warriors
who are as skilled as you.
She is a very excellent warrior.
She is the one who saved
my life from Ambikumar.
No need to praise me so much.
The one who saved us
all from Ambikumar
was Princess Durdhara herself.
What kind of a woman are you?
You raised weapon
against your own husband?
Acharya.
Husband?
- I did not understand.
- Oh, yes.
Did you not tell her?
She almost got married to him.
And the circumambulations?
The circumambulations
were almost done.
Right, Durdhara? Tell them.
Chandragupta, if you will
say even a single more word
then I will really go away from here
and will complete
my remaining circumambulations.
Where is mother?
Chandra.
I think the right time has come
when the true heir to this state
will host this flag
again at its place.
He will bring the lost dignity
of Piplivan back.
If I want to extinguish this fire
then I have two resources
available here.
This water and this sand.
But if I use water to extinguish it
then the fire will be extinguished
but if I want to ignite the fire again
then I will have to wait
for the sticks to dry first.
Whereas, if I use sand
then the fire will
quickly be extinguished
and if I want to ignite
the fire again
then even that can be done.
This is how even your problems have
more than one solutions.
Wisdom does not lie
on which solution you find.
Wisdom lies on finding the solution
which can save both
your time and your labour
in future.
My ethics..
Your destiny.
Find out if Shipra left
to deliver her friend's omen.
- She is on her way.
- Good!
Because, I will present Chandragupta
a very special gift on his wedding.

================================================================================

'I do not want to go, Mother!'
'Promise me, my friend.
No matter what'
'you will establish yourself
on this throne'
'and fulfill the dream
of a united Bharat.'
'I want to take birth in
a free and independent India.'
'I want to take birth under
the rule of Chandragupta Maurya.'
'May the enemy be defeated.'
'Let my country be
united and victorious.'
May the enemy be defeated.
Let my country be
united and victorious.
May the enemy be defeated.
Let my country be
united and victorious.
The 'Piplivan' flag is hoisted
a top the 'Piplivan' castle.
It waves freely in the wind.
If I had witnessed this
on any other day
it would have angered me. But today
the sight of it is giving me pleasure.
Amatya.
Find out if Shipra left
to deliver her friend's omen.
Yes, my King. She is on her way.
Good!
Very good!
Let the wedding arrangements continue
because I will present Chandragupta
a very special gift
on his wedding.
Durdhara.
I wore this dress
when I became the queen of Piplivan.
It was also my wedding dress.
And I want you to wear this dress
during the holy matrimony
between you and Chandragupta.
Dhananand completely
destroyed this castle.
But he could not harm
the spirit within its walls.
Because, we were able
to safe guard it's spirit
before he could do any harm.
And in protecting
the spirit of this castle
this dress too remained safe.
Durdhara.
Come on, I'll show you to your room.
Hey, wait a minute!
Where are you going?
I just said it.
Durdhara's room is ready.
So, I shall show her to her room.
No, you may not.
Now you cannot meet the bride
till the wedding.
Fine.
Then let me give her
directions to her room.
- Please come, Durdhara.
- No need of that.
I will show her to her room.
Oh, I see.
You are all a part of this.
It is shameful, Chandra.
You are the great emperor of 'India'.
And yet, you do not have patience.
What? What did I do?
Oh, come on.
We all saw who you were looking at.
Yes. I saw that as well.
Mother, you always take
Stulbhadra's side.
But do not forget
that you not his but, my mother.
Really?
- That is not how it is.
- That is not how it is.
Chanakya.
What is this danger you sense?
We have left our enemies far behind.
This is no ordinary enemy,
Shyam Singh.
No matter how far behind he is
he always succeeds in finding
a path to reach us.
Who is it?
It is I, Shipra.
Shipra! Oh, no!
Do not let her in, Chanakya.
She is a very dangerous woman.
She always bears some sort of danger.
Be quiet, Stulbhadra.
Upon hearing about Durdhara's wedding
I could not stop myself.
If you allow me to be
a part of this wedding
I will be forever grateful to you.
Chandragupta, before you let her in
read her intentions.
That is very important.
Do not forget the situation
we are in.
We must be cautious in every step.
Acharya, Shipra is Durdhara's friend.
And there is no one in the wedding
from the bride's side.
And now, if her friend is here
should we not let her in?
Chandra is right, Acharya.
We can at least do this for Durdhara.
Having a friend at the wedding
will help Durdhara relax.
Thank you all for bringing me here.
Where is Princess Durdhara?
Come, let me take you to her room.
Chandragupta, your nature
of trusting people so easily
is not at all right.
And especially when we are in a war
with an enemy as cunning
and smart as Dhananand.
But, Acharya, it is not right either
to be suspicious about everyone.
Anyway,
Shipra is not just any other servant.
She has been Durdhara's
childhood friend
and she is loyal towards her.
Chandragupta, circumstances can bring
a change in anybody's loyalty.
I hope this is not true
in the case of Shipra.
How dare you come here!
Who let you in?
Get lost!
Do not say that, princess.
I just wanted to be a part
of my friend's wedding.
Friend?
Do you actually
consider me your friend?
Do not forget that it is because
of you that Amatya caught me.
Back then, I was trying go
to the temple of our family deity
on my father's death anniversary.
Do you even remember that?
'I apologise, princess.'
'I could not have let you do this.'
I do remember that.
Please forgive me for whatever I did.
But do not break
this years of friendship.
You have helped me in my worst times.
Then please let me be here
in this good time of yours.
This is what friends do
for each other. Right?
Sire, the relation between
Shipra and the princess
has not been good from a while.
I think we must direct our army.
Because we cannot depend on Shipra
regarding such a plan.
It can be a very big risk.
Amatya,
even a small particular of dust
falling in our eyes
can ruin our sight.
Shipra is that small dust particular.
Rest assured.
Because Shipra will surely
fulfill the task assigned to her.
Who is that?
What are you doing here, Shipra?
Shipra, I asked you
what you are doing here.
You told me that you are going
to princess Durdhara's room.
Then what are you doing here alone?
This place is quite far from
Princess Durdhara's room.
Pardon me, Acharya.
I wanted to make sandal paste
for the princess for her wedding.
So I came here to gather
the sandal wood.
That is it.
Sandalwood?
It will be beneficial for the princess
if you wash it
with camphor water first.
Sure.
Acharya must have got all the doors
and windows of the palace shut by now.
Ensure that we have our men
deployed at all the entry points.
Understood?
Chandra, what are you doing here?
Stulbhadra, I was directing
them to be deployed
at all the entry points of the palace.
- Remember..
- Oh! The future king..
Please calm down.
It is your wedding today.
Worry about your wedding
preparations instead.
Stulbhadra,
this is not a normal wedding.
I am marrying Princess Durdhara
and she is my enemy's sister.
We do not even know what Dhananand
must be planning against us.
Rather than regretting later
it would be better for us
to be alert and careful now.
All right. Leave that to me.
Go and get ready for the wedding.
Go.
- But, Stulbhadra, you..
- Chandra, did you not hear me?
I will take care of everything. Go on!
Go..
- Be careful.
- Yes.
Who could have thought
that my best friend
will get married
under these circumstances?
On the one hand, we are making
arrangements for a wedding
and on the other,
we are getting ready for battle.
All this is happening
because of that evil Dhananand.
I hope that this wedding
happens without any difficulties.
Spread around the fort.
Until the king sends
his orders keep hiding.
Remember that we have to attack
after receiving his orders.
Let us go.
Thank you, Princess,
for trusting me again.
After what you did to me
initially, I was angry with you.
But now.. Now, I am happy.
Because in the name of a family
only you are with me at my wedding.
Today, you are my friend
and my sister as well.
Oh! You have not used
the sandalwood paste.
Anyway, your face is glowing
so much with happiness
that you do not need these pastes.
You are too much.
Now, help me wear that necklace.
Of course.
What happened?
Nothing.
'What are the soldiers
from Magadh doing here?'
'It means Shipra has deceived me.'
Tell me. Why did you do this, Shipra?
Answer me!
He is the one who killed my brother.
He is the reason behind
my mother's death.
Because of him, my family ended.
Think about it. If you had been in
my shoes what would you have done?
At least, I don't cheat my friend.
But what did you do? You betrayed me.
You betrayed me.
How many soldiers
are hidden in this palace?
And where are they hiding?
Tell me.
There are too many.
Some of them are here
and some of them are outside.
Some of them are on the way.
They can reach here anytime.
Today, Chandragupta will not be
able to escape from here.
There is no way to escape
from here for him.
I have to stop this
disaster at any cost.
The clay pot helps
the water stay cold.
But if this water is kept
in the pot for many days
it goes bad.
The water that could have
quenched your thirst
makes you ill.
That is why it is important
to change the water
in the pot regularly.
Similarly, no matter
how successful you become
if you stop working on yourself
in the field of your work
then like the water in the pot
gradually your qualities
and strength leave you.
So, remember
that no matter how successful you are
do not stop working upon yourself.
If you do that
you can enjoy
the fruits of your labour.
Because the taste of
hard work and diligence
is always sweet.
My ethics..
Your destiny.
Chandra. It seems that the soldiers
of Magadh have invaded the fort.

================================================================================

Episode: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8hf8ZBF5q0

I wonder how people wear it.
Princess Durdhara has sent
this message for you, Prince.
'I want to tell you something.'
'Meet me in the basement of the fort.'
It is good that you know the ways
to express love, Princess.
Because I am weak in this field.
Durdhara.
What do you want to tell me, Durdhara?
- Stulbhadra?
- Chandra?
What are you doing here?
Durdhara asked me
to come here through a message.
And you?
Even I got Durdhara's letter.
I did too.
I got her letter too.
Me too.
What is happening?
All your answers are here.
Durdhara's letter?
'Chandragupta, I do not think
I can ever betray my brother.'
'Anyway, blood relations
cannot be forgotten easily.'
'Moreover, my brother has done
so many things for me.'
'He is my family
and he means the world to me.'
'Forgive me, but I cannot marry you.'
'Durdhara.'
Chandragupta.
A huge army is standing outside
the northern part of the fort.
Even at the eastern part!
We have been surrounded, Acharya.
Chandra.
It seems that the soldiers of Magadh
have invaded the fort.
Durdhara has betrayed us!
You are looking more beautiful
wearing your wedding attire.
It seems that my sister is not happy
to see me here.
By the way, do you not think that
the fire pit prepared for your wedding
is too small to act
as Chandragupta's pyre?
But I have a solution.
I have an idea.
When Chandragupta comes here
I will cut him into pieces
and burn those pieces
in this fire pit.
I will offer your future husband
to the sacred fire.
[Sanskrit shlok]
By the way, where is Chandragupta
and the rest of your in-laws?
It is not right to make
the bride-to-be wait.
It is all right.
My soldiers will soon find them
and bring them here.
Break this door!
Amatya!
I am eager to offer Chandragupta
to this sacred fire.
Why is it taking so much time
to bring him here?
Rest assured, Your Highness.
Our soldiers will be bringing him here
at any moment.
No!
No, Amatya.
Something is not right.
You are smiling.
So, my intelligent sister
has already informed
Chandragupta about my attack.
Indeed.
I did the same, King.
Amatya!
Bring that boy to me
as soon as possible.
Your order will be carried out,
Your Highness.
No matter how much
your entire army tries
the way air cannot be captured
in the same way,
capturing Chandra is impossible.
Move forth!
Go! Look in every nook and corner.
They must be here.
Find them!
Move forth!
'Now, these soldiers
cannot break free'
'from these oil-dipped ropes.'
Everyone, move out!
Tarini, go to the queen.
- I will help Chandragupta..
- Acharya.
Let me help him.
Chandragupta!
Hurry up.
I trust that after displaying
utter foolishness
you must have realised
that you are not going anywhere.
You will stay with me.
Once again, you went against me
and helped that boy.
This is the biggest
mistake of your life.
I am not afraid
of what you will do to me, King.
Not only today, but I will side
with Chandra every time.
What I did today
was to make you realise
that when we love someone
then no matter what happens
we do not let that person be harmed.
It does not matter,
if we have to make sacrifices
to achieve that.
But it is right to give up
everything for love.
Vishambhu!
Take my sister to her room.
And ensure that you have
your eyes on her every moment.
Chandragupta, now let me see
how far you go.
How can Durdhara do this with us?
Considering what all happened
in the last few days
if she did not want to marry Chandra
she could have told us about it.
We were not forcing her
into this marriage.
Why did she betray us?
Why did she trap us here?
Not just that
she called the whole army
of Magadh along with Dhananand.
Not just of Magadh
but we have the army all the 14 kingdoms
which come under Dhananand.
What you said is wrong, Stul.
What?
That Durdhara betrayed us.
Durdhara did all that
only to save us.
If we are here all alive,
in spite of being surrounded
by the massive army of 14 kingdoms
its credit goes to Durdhara.
It is because of her
that we are alive today.
How can you be so sure about it?
In case you do not know this
it was Durdhara who cheated us
in the Hawa Mahal battle.
'It is Durdhara who did this,
Chandra.'
'She betrayed us
in the pretext of helping us.'
'She snatched Indra's dagger'
'attacked us and ran away.'
'I made this plan to deceive you.'
'Look there.'
'My brother will be here soon
and finish you all.'
And you read her message yourself.
Then why are you still saying
that she did not betray us?
Because my heart says so.
And now, I am going
to bring back Durdhara.
Chandragupta cannot save himself
from our massive army, Sire.
He would not have gone too far.
Just give me your command.
No, Amatya
he will not go without Durdhara.
'Remember this.'
'When you capture Chandragupta
and Chanakya'
'do not wait for me.'
'Kill them right there.'
'Chandragupta, who would have thought'
'that you will die
such a simple death?'
'When Chandragupta comes here'
'I will cut him into small pieces'
'and put them in this havan.'
'I will offer your future husband'
'to the holy fire.'
'I hope Chandra has managed'
'to get away safely from here
along with everyone.'
What sound was that?
Well..
I got a cut by a sharp stick.
Look, I am bleeding.
Go, bring some healing paste for me.
No.
I have been asked to keep
a close watch on you.
I cannot leave you and go.
Do you have any idea how many soldiers
and guards are deployed here?
Around 1500-2000.
Do you actually think I can
deceive so many soldiers?
I am bleeding. I am feeling pain.
You can imagine
what the emperor will do to you
if something happens to me.
So, will you bring
the healing paste or not?
Durdhara..
No, you should not be here.
Go back right now.
I will not leave you and go.
Let us go.
Did you not get my message?
I cannot go with you.
I will not cheat my brother.
I did get your message.
But it did not hurt me
as much as what you just said.
That you still think that I
consider you the same old Durdhara.
The one
whom I never used to trust.
I think that is what made you think
that I will leave you here and go.
No, Durdhara.
I have come here to take you.
I am the same Durdhara
whom you knew before.
I am loyal to only my brother.
I have no feelings for you.
I just
love my brother.
That is, King Dhananand.
No matter what you say
I can see the reality in your eyes.
Durdhara,
I know why you are doing this.
All right, let us go.
I am ready to come with you.
But we should do it fast.
Let us go.
Durdhara, hold my hand.
Durdhara, what are you doing?
Hold my hand.
There are too many soldiers
deployed out there.
You will not be able to take me out.
You must let me go.
No, Durdhara. I have come to take you.
You cannot do this.
Durdhara, stop. Listen to me.
Durdhara sent Vishambhu
outside her room.
That means, Chandragupta is here.
Chandragupta, I told you
that I am not with you
only for my feelings.
I have a very big reason
to be with you.
I want to
rebel the king.
Durdhara, no.
Chandragupta, do this for my sake.
Please carry on this war of
righteousness against the injustice.
This revolution
should not stop because of me.
Turn your love into your power.
Do not let it weaken you.
I want to be your power.
I will always be in your heart.
Durdhara..
Get up!
Chandragupta!
- Amatya.
- Yes, Your Majesty?
I took back Chandragupta's motherland
from him again.
I have got my sister back as well.
Now I want to see that boy dead.
Go
and catch him.
And present his corpse to me.
As you wish, Your Majesty.
His corpse will soon be at your feet.
Durdhara?
I am sure, Chandra
that she will come back to us.
Your Majesty, Chandragupta,
we do not have much time left.
We killed this squad of soldiers
but they are many in numbers.
If they catch us, we will surely die.
We cannot let Durdhara's
sacrifice be wasted.
We have to leave this place.
My mother had taught me
this tune when I was a kid.
It always helps in calming
the birds and animals.
I cannot tell you how big
a favour you have done to me
by saving my life.
I have only these animals.
I will be grateful if I can
help all of you in life.
We need a place to spend the night.
If you could help us..
According to the rules of our village
no stranger can stay here.
But I am sure
that you can get permission at least
for one night if I talk to them.
Come with me.
Comee, Chandragupta.
We will have to decide our next plan
against Dhananand very soon.
'Our paths can never be the same.'
'I will have to find a solution to
go away from these people.'
What happened, sister?
Why are you so quiet?
I am sure that
this is the kind of farewell
that you would have imagined
after getting married to Chandragupta.
What happened?
Did I not do justice
to your imagination?
I want to make this
moment unforgettable
for my sister
because I will ensure
that you and that traitor never unite.
And I will do this for your wellbeing.
Just wait and watch
how I will kill Chandragupta.
But for the time being,
climb that chariot
because we will leave for Magadh.
Your Majesty,
I myself want to go to Magadh
as soon as possible
because I am sure
that Chandragupta will definitely
come there one day.
Not just for me
but to free you from
your favourite throne.
Come, let us go to Magadh.
Amatya, this traitor will have to die.
Kill him before he makes up his mind
to convert his defeat
into his victory.
Search every corner of this area.
He should not have any place to hide.
As you said, Your Majesty.
This small piece of sandpaper
appears to be useless
and waste on its own
till it is used
in the right way.
This small piece of sandpaper
that appears to be useless
helps to make this wood complete
and to make its corners attractive.
Similarly
no human being is useless.
It is important for him
to take the right decision
in the right situation.
The outcome can be beautiful then.
My ethics..
Your destiny.
Our war strategy was not
right against Dhananand.
Yes, Acharya.
We need to change our strategy now.
You are right, Chandragupta.
We will not attack Dhananand directly.
We will attack the territories close
to the border and reduce his strength.

================================================================================

Episode: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2Hs7rvuLVI

This is our ordinary village.
I can do only this much for you.
There is no special arrangement
for guests in our village.
This is enough for us, pal.
Thank you very much.
Tomorrow,
we will leave before sunrise.
Please come. Come with me.
Where are you going?
Grandmother's Khichri..
Acharya, our enemies have
the weapons manufactured
by the best artisans of the world.
How will we face them
with knives and daggers?
Acharya.
- Are you all right now?
- Yes.
Dear, listen to me carefully.
You should eat Khichri from one side.
The middle portion
of Khichri is very hot.
Start eating Khichri from one side.
Move towards
the middle portion gradually.
The middle portion
will become cold by then.
- Am I right?
- Yes.
Eat now.
Acharya, I am sure the same thing
is going on in our mind.
Yes, Chandragupta.
Our war strategy was
not right against Dhananand.
Yes, Acharya.
Attacking Piplivan, the biggest
and the most cherished
achievement of Dhananand,
was our biggest mistake.
We put our hand
in the middle portion of hot Khichri.
Hence,
we burned our hand in this battle.
And Dhananand won the battle.
But Acharya, we need
to change our strategy now.
You are right, Chandragupta.
We will not attack Dhananand directly.
We will attack the territories close
to the border and reduce his strength.
And we will snatch
a big portion of his kingdom
away from him gradually.
After reducing his strength
we will attack the central region
of his empire, Patliputra
and dethrone the oppressor
and cruel emperor, Dhananand.
Perfect, Acharya.
Your Highness,
everyone is eager to know
when the King of Magadh
will return home.
Many congratulations to you
for your win.
You have kept your domination
and control over Piplivan intact.
Your supremacy is unquestionable
and it will always remain so
no matter how hard Chandragupta tries.
Congratulations to you as well,
Princess.
Durdhara, my beloved sister..
Let me introduce you to him again.
He is your new bodyguard, Ambikumar.
What happened?
I am following the old custom.
You fall in love with
your bodyguard, right?
Have an affair with Ambikumar
since you are going to marry him.
However,
it was Ambikumar's suggestion.
He is humble and broad-minded.
I was about to fix
your marriage with him.
But he suggested me
that it will be good if both of you
fall in love with each other
before the marriage.
For your kind information,
let me inform you
that your favourite, Ambikumar,
attacked me with his soldiers.
And I am sure
that he will not hesitate to kill me
if he gets a chance.
You are not aware
of his real character, Brother.
Brother!
After so many years, you have called me brother
instead of calling me the emperor.
But unfortunately
you did not call me brother
for your love for me.
Chandragupta is the reason
behind this.
It is great, Ambikumar.
You have so much influence
on my sister.
Since Ambikumar has
so much influence on you
I am stick to my decision.
And you will get rid
of your bad habits
and never
betray your brother.
As far as your disliking
for Ambikumar is concerned
let me remind you.
it is you who gave
the proposal to marry
Ambikumar in Takshashila.
Hence, it does not make
any difference to me.
Moreover
even stopped thinking about me
my beloved sister.
Durdhara, I will take your leave then.
Acharya, I have understood
your lesson about Khichri.
But how do we attack
Dhananand's vast empire
from the shores?
We have no military strength.
But we have surprise on our side.
And knowledge.
We only need a resource
which will give us every single
information about Dhananand.
What sort of information?
The information which we can use
to dent Magadh's army
and make it hollow
which will help us
attack outer provinces
and kingdoms of Magadh.
And we can gradually establish
our rule over them.
Once the outer provinces
of Magadh are conquered
our next objective will be
Magadh's capital, Patliputra.
There is only one way
to get this information, Acharya.
We have to send a spy
to Dhananand's camp.
A spy who can give us
every single information
about Dhananand
learn his deepest secrets
and read his thoughts.
We have such a spy among us.
Who are you talking about, Acharya?
Tarini.
Yes, Chandragupta.
Tarini possess all the attributes
of a good and deft spy.
For some time now
I have been subtly observing
Tarini's behaviour.
She is a skilled warrior
but she is also cunning.
When needed,
she becomes a skilled warrior.
And when needed
she knows how to transform into
a helpless woman the very next moment.
She knows how
to change her personality
as the situations demand.
Not only this.
She does justice
and always supoorts the truth.
'When Dhananand attacked Piplivan'
she saved us from his wrath.
She is sharp, subtle aware
and most importantly
she is a beautiful woman
who can easily ensnare
the cook of the palace.
In this battle, Tarini can prove
to be very helpful to us.
You are right, Acharya.
Tarini will be suitable for this job!
There can be no one else
better suited to be a spy.
I agree with Acharya.
But the problem is
that Tarini has left.
She left?
What do you mean?
I saw her leaving discreetly
when we came to the village.
When asked, she said
she could not help us
because our objectives are different.
Our objective is Dhananand,
Your Majesty.
Why does Tarini not want
to go to Dhananand?
I do not know about that.
But I think there is a relationship
between Dhananand and her.
'Why do I feel like
I have seen you before?'
'Me?'
'Oh, no! I am sure you'
'have never seen me before.'
'Have you ever been
to Magadh or Patliputra?'
'No, never. You must have
seen someone else.'
Mother is right!
Whenever Dhananand is mentioned
Tarini got uncomfortable
and became different.
If that is the case, we have to find out
about the cause as soon as possible.
Just as we find the cause
we will know about relationship
between Dhananand and Tarini.
It will help us
in sending Tarini
to Dhananand's camp as a spy.
I think I know where
Tarini might be right now.
'It has been so long
since I saw you last.'
'The time seems to have
stood still for me.'
'Neither am I able to forget my past'
'nor am I living in the present.'
'And I not able to think
about the future either.'
'Nothing seems to have value.'
Truth is like a vast ocean, Tarini
that can neither be
hid inside a chest
nor can it be erased
with piece of a cloth.
The time has come for you to face
the past you have been
running away from.
And present it to us.
No matter how hard
one tries to hide truth
it appears before everyone one day.
The day has come for you today.
Tell me, Tarini.
What your relationship with Dhananand?
It is better for everyone
that some truths not to be
become known.
Yours and my path can never coincide.
So it is for better
that you walk your path
and I will walk mine.
Tarini, you are not
leaving this place until
you answer our questions.
I am not bound to answer
any question of yours!
You are! You are bound
to answer our questions, Tarini!
Every word and work of yours
has thrown light
on your mysterious reality.
Initially, I was suspicious of the fact
that you are a spy sent by Dhananand.
Then, the death of Mahisha
cleared that doubt but..
That does not mean
the needle of suspicion
has been taken away from you.
Your credibility is still
under suspicion, Tarini.
I have noticed that whenever
you have to face Dhananand
you try to run away from him.
Acharya and I noticed
that you were hiding
the sketch of Dhananand.
So, you have to answer
all our questions right now..
Right here!
Now I know, that you have
not lost your memory
nor you are a woman who is weak!
Enough!
Enough of this!
Do not say a word! Say nothing!
Tarini..
I can understand that
this is not easy for you.
You may take your time if you want to.
But let me be loud and clear.
Today, we need answers
to our questions.
It seems that I know
Dhananand since ages.
I had seen him for the first time
at the hermitage of my father.
He had come there for his training
and I was also there.
Dhananand was a dedicated
and an excellent student.
In the eyes of my father he was
the best and a talented student.
Good!
Very Good!
Train yourself the way
you have been doing.
The day will not be far,
when you will become
the most excellent
warrior of all times.
Very soon, we got attracted
towards each other.
He was good looking
and a wealthy student.
He used to allure me
with expensive gifts.
My father came to know
that love was blossoming
between Dhananand and me.
So, he wanted to make
a more able and an excellent
student out of the lover
of his daughter.
So that, Dhananand becomes worthy
of becoming my life-partner.
My father started a special
training for Dhananand.
Dhananand got more importance
than his seven brothers.
In no time, Dhananand become
an expert in the field of warfare
which I was in.
Gradually, he became
an excellent student than me.
After gaining excellent skills
and training
Dhananand became an expert
and efficient than all his brothers.
But even after being so close to me..
Even after having
so much love for me..
His personality had such a quality
which I could not understand.
According to me, love snatches away
the ability of a person
to think and understand.
That is why, even when
Dhananand was close to me
I could not grasp his stark truth.
The truth of Dhananand?
What truth are you talking about?
The love of Dhananand for me
was pretentious.
I know that you are upset with me.
Yes. I made you a resource
to gain special expertise
from your father.
His tenacity.. His knowledge..
I wanted all of qualities
for myself and not for my brothers.
But think for yourself..
If I had not taken this step
would it not be injustice
for the kingdom of Magadha?
My brothers are elder to me
but I am an expert
where capability is concerned.
I have all the qualities which
a king of Magadh should have.
So, only I have the right to rule
the kingdom of Magadh!
So, this is the reason,
I think it is not right
to demean or think inappropriately
for a future king.
If your actions and love for me
was only for becoming
the emperor of Magadh
then, go and become one.
You should not have come to me.
I admit that initially
I considered you to be only a source
but gradually, I truly fell
in love with you, Tara.
The importance is not
only to set the goal
but also to achieve it.
And my goal was..
You.
Only you.
My love towards him is pure,
selfless and blind.
That is why I believed
the truth told by him.
I accepted his love proposal.
And I gave him
the same place in my life
which he was already seated upon.
But I realised very soon
that the place for me and my love
in his life are not very important.
Only one intention
was important for him.
The goal of becoming
the greatest king of the country.
And not just mine
but the black day
of Magadh also arrived
when I saw the cruel,
selfish and dark form
of Dhananand's personality.
'King Parmanand has ordered to call
you and your brothers, Prince.'
And his father was murdered
on the same day.
My guess is correct, right?
Yes.
Through embrace.
This art of killing the enemy
was taught to him by my father.
That was the beginning of the downfall
of Dhananand's character
and personality.
With every passing day
his greed and stubbornness
of becoming
the most powerful king
of the country was increasing.
I would get to see a new and dangerous
form of Dhananand everyday.
Slowly, he was turning into
a demon from a human being
by following the path of his greed.
That is why you left Dhananand
and chose this life for you.
I thought if anybody
could stop Dhananand from
being inhuman, it was only me.
I tried my level best to make him
follow the right path.
I told him that he is wrong.
But my love was shattered
against Dhananand's stubbornness.
'Listen to me, Dhananand.'
'Do not fall prey to this trap
of power and strength.'
'You have already killed
many innocent people.'
'Stop now.'
'We can lead a beautiful life
with whatever we have.'
'Leave this life of killing people,
Dhananand.'
'Nobody can stop me now, Tara.'
'I have to achieve a lot now.'
'Dhananand, I will not let you go.'
'All the arrangements to attack
Piplivan have been made.'
'What is your next order?'
'Leave me, Tara.'
When I got to know how he betrayed
your father, King Chandravardhan
by going in the form of a peacemaker
and how he destroyed Piplivan..
That is it.
That night, I went against Dhananand
ffor the first time in life and helped
the people of Dhananand.
From that moment,
I made everyone believe
that I have lost my memory
because I wanted to leave behind
all my memories associated
with Dhananand.
I did not want to have
any ties with him.
That is why I chose this life
with the people of Piplivan.
A life
which was totally different from
all the moments spent with Dhananand.
But my past is trying
to scare me again.
And I will not let that happen.
I will have to go away from everyone.
I will have to go away from my past.
Listen to me, Tarini.
If there was any weak
or immoral woman in your place
she would lead
her life with Dhananand.
She would lead her life
with all the richness
and support Dhananand
in his injustice.
But you..
You are different from everyone.
That is why your choice
was also different from others.
That is why you refused to support
Dhananand in his sinful life.
This is praiseworthy.
But, Tarini, how long will you keep
running away from your past?
Dhananand is equally greedy even today
to get the power and the throne.
He has killed many innocent people.
Many people are being tortured by him.
Tarini.
Nobody can drive away
the darkness of your past.
But if you help us in this revolution
along with you, the darkness created
in the lives of many people through
Dhananand's torture can be driven away.
Tarini, we need a trustworthy informer
in Dhananand's camp
and with the help of that person
we will free the cruel
Dhananand from his throne
and form a united India.
According to me
you can become that informer, Tarini
because Dhananand
will never suspect you.
No.
I cannot begin the dark phase
of my past again.
I will have to go.
Tarini.
Think calmly once.
I have taken this decision
several years ago.
I cannot face Dhananand now.
Acharya!
A major fire has broken out
in Santhuk Village.
All of you come quickly.
This is the same village
where we had taken shelter.
No.
The people whom your villagers
gave shelter are not good people.
You gave shelter to those people
who made the king angry.
This was your mistake.
Father.
Father..
'Why are all of you
bowing down to me?'
'Because you are
the only one in this world'
'whom I bow down to.'
Mother.
All of them..
Everything happened all of a sudden.
Dhananand's army arrived
and they spread in all directions.
Have you ever realised?
A tree bearing the highest fruits
are bent the most due
to the weight of the fruits.
We should use the same
principle in our lives too.
No matter how much success, knowledge
victory and money you gain in life
your personality should be
humble and soft.
Through your knowledge
bring humility and depth
in your personality
and not ego.
That is when this world
will respect and value
your achievements.
My ethics..
Your destiny.
We will have to wipe out
Dhananand's brother from our path.
Which will make him weak
from everywhere.
- Our first target will be..
- Pandugati.
The chief of the armoury of Magadh.

================================================================================

Episode: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKX8Km0-5_s

How does he manage to escape
our assault always, Amatya!
Do not worry, Your Highness.
Because our soldiers have destroyed
all the places where they could hide.
They all will die soon.
And no one will give them shelter after
what has happened in that village.
They have very less options
and we have resources
more than they can imagine.
No! No, Amatya!
We have to establish
a strong message against them.
Right here in Magadh,
not anywhere else.
Otherwise, Chandragupta's
supporters' hope will be boosted
and the courage as well.
Did you not hear how everyone
was hailing him that day?
Now, if they will get to know
that their hero is alive
then their courage will be boosted.
That means
we have to punish those people
who hailed him that day
when he sent you as a captive.
Yes, Amatya.
I can still hear the echo
of their hails till date.
Those voices do not
let me sleep, Amatya.
We have to make them silent
and make them quiet!
That is why catch all of them
and bring in front of me.
Drag them out of their houses
and bring in front of me no matter
how many they are, Amatya.
I want to show them
all the consequence of standing
against me and in favour
of Chandragupta.
Your order will be followed,
Your Highness.
'You know what? Mother always says'
'that the feeling she has
the most towards my father'
'is the feeling of respect.'
'And today..'
'Today, I have started
to respect you, Durdhara.'
'I got your message.'
'But your message did not hurt me'
'as much as your statement
that you still think that I..'
'That I consider you to be
the same old Durdhara.'
How dare you enter my room
without my permission, Ambikumar!
You
are unnecessarily being angry,
Princess.
I think you forgot that
your brother appointed me
as your bodyguard.
And..
Being your bodyguard
it is my duty to always stay near you
so that I can protect your soft hands
and can make sure
that the smile is always intact
in your beautiful face.
And slowly..
I can make..
This time, I just gave you
a small cut, Ambikumar!
Next time, if you will even think
of crossing your limit
then remember one thing.
I am the sister
of His Highness Dhananand!
The sister
whom he loves more than his life.
I may have betrayed him
and gave him a lot of pain
but if you try to harm me in any way
then brother will not spare you!
Understood!
What do you think! Am I a fool!
Will I harm you under
the supervision of His Highness?
No.
I will just do my duty.
I will stay around you
day in and day out as your bodyguard.
I will make you helpless soon
to forget Chandragupta
and to beg me to marry you.
You know what, Tarini?
Our country is going
towards destruction,
not just because of some cruel
ruthless and greedy rulers
but those good people
are also responsible for it
who do not stand
against this injustice.
By good people,
I am referring to the ones
who have strength,
intelligence and capability.
But despite having all this
they stay quiet
against those tortures.
Everyone might have their own reasons.
But they forget
that their silence
and their helplessness
are encouraging
this torture even more.
Yes, Tarini.
Anybody who has this strength,
intelligence and capability
should not be quiet
with regard to this torture
and this injustice
towards the country.
He will have to express
his anger and his right.
That is when our great country
will be free from the rule
of cruel kings like Dhananand.
That is when a united India
will be formed.
If you still want to leave
we will not stop you, Tarini.
You can stay away from Dhananand
and lead your life.
But remember one thing.
Life has given you a new chance
to make the right choice
and to follow the path of justice.
Do not lose this chance, Tarini.
Your decision can give
a new chapter to the history.
Tarini, you are clever.
You are clever. You are sensible.
Think and answer me.
Will you support us in this revolution?
Your Majesty, as per your order
every supporter
of Chandragupta in Magadh
has been arrested.
Forgive us, Your Majesty.
Have mercy on us.
Have mercy on us.
Forgive us, Your Majesty.
But I am sorry, Your Majesty.
I did not understand one thing.
Why did you give an order
to bring everyone here
and kill them together when we could
have killed them in their houses?
Because they will be
a witness to my strength.
Forgive us, Your Majesty.
Have mercy on us.
Anybody who tried to go against me
and praised my enemy
will be killed by me at once
and I will establish my power
and domination once again.
Considering how they were
singing praises of
Chandragupta, together..
I will kill all of them
in one shot.
Amazing!
Well, where is my dear brother,
Rashtrapal?
I have a special weapon
that I will gift him.
And I am sure that he will like
this weapon very much.
I will silence every voice
that will raise against me
and in favour of that traitor.
Acharya, the 'Khichdi' incident
has taught us
that we should attack
Dhananand's territory
in the border areas
and make them weak
and we have sent Tarini there
so that she can give us
important information
through which we can understand
Dhananand's activities before hand
and succeed in defeating him
and that will make that man weak.
Acharya, everything seems
to be fine so far.
But what do we have to do next?
What is our next plan?
Till then, Chandragupta,
we will also do the same thing
that Tarini is doing.
Till Tarini gives us
any important information
we will focus on
making Dhananand weak.
And we will target
Dhananand's brothers
to achieve this goal of ours.
His brothers?
But he considers his brothers useless.
He does not lose an opportunity
to humiliate them.
Dhananand is cruel,
but he is smart too.
And this is his smartness
that he has hidden
his biggest strength
from his enemies.
He humiliates his brothers
in front of everyone.
He proves that they are useless.
That is why nobody in this world
specially, his enemies
do not look at his brothers.
But the truth is
the foundation of Dhananand's
kingdom of Magadh
lays on the strong
shoulders of his six brothers.
Assume that if Magadh
is a huge building
these six brothers are the six pillars
on which that building is standing.
And all of them make
Dhananand powerful
in different ways.
So, these pillars
are Dhananand's brothers.
So, to kill Dhananand
we will have to destroy his brothers.
I mean, these pillars.
This will automatically destroy
Dhananand and his rule.
Am I right, Acharya?
All these six brothers of Dhananand
are like the strong pillars
of this kingdom
who, according to their capabilities
discharge their duties
towards the kingdom.
Rashtrapal comes first.
Anger is his weakness.
He is in charge of the armoury
of Dhananand.
From the making
of weapons to its' availability..
All these tasks come under him.
Then, comes Bhutapala.
He is drowned in desire and lust.
He is in charge
of the spies of Dhananand.
Bhutapala has been assigned
to recruit and train the spies.
Then, it is Dashasidikh.
He is known for his jealousy.
The judicial system of Magadh
comes under him.
Then, comes Pandugati.
Being lazy, is his specialty.
He is the chief of the food
and grains section.
And this is Pandu..
His weakness is greed.
This is the reason Dhananand
made him the chief of treasury.
He collects interests from people
and looks after the financial matters.
In the end..
Kaivarta.
His personality has made him
be close to Dhananand.
He is drowned in ego and pride.
He is the army general of Dhananand.
The biggest army of other kingdoms
could not withstand
his might and capabilities.
So, Chandragupta
these are the six brothers of Dhananand..
The six pillars of
the kingdom of Magadh
whom we have to wipe out
from our path.
Once we get rid of them
then, Dhananand will become weak.
After that, for the last time
by attacking Patliputra
we will be able to dethrone
that oppressor.
But Acharya
I have a question.
How will we kill all the seven brothers
of Dhananand at once?
Is it not impossible to kill them
in this prevailing situation?
You are right, Chandragupta.
Definitely, we will kill
the brothers of Dhananand
but not all at once.
We will kill them one at a time.
We will strategise
a plan and kill them.
- Our first target will be..
- Rashtrapal..
- The chief of the armoury of Magadh.
- Correct.
As I has said before
the weakness of Rashtrapal
is his anger..
His uncontrollable
and excessive anger.
That is the reason, Dhananand has
made him the chief of the armoury.
So that his weakness
can be brought to use.
The weapons of Magadh
is as sharp and lethal as his anger.
Chandragupta, if we get rid
of Rashtrapal from our path
then, this strike will
not only be for Dhananand
but also the entire army of Magadh.
My dear brother, Rashtrapal..
I want to witness these weaklings
getting annihilate
by your fiery anger.
There..
They are your prey.
Show me your special
and powerful weapon
which I have specially
announced today for display.
Soldiers.
Mercy! Have mercy on us, Emperor!
Forgive us, Emperor!
Forgive us, Emperor!
Emperor, have mercy!
Emperor, have mercy!
Forgive us, Emperor!
Nobody can stop me from displaying
the painful death of those
who have supported Chandragupta.
Mercy, Emperor..
Forgive us, Emperor!
Emperor, have mercy!
Emperor, have mercy!
Forgive us, Emperor!
Forgive us, Emperor!
Emperor, have mercy!
Emperor, have mercy!
Emperor, have mercy!
What is going on here?
The Emperor has ordered
that the supporters of Chandragupta
will be killed publicly.
A lot of people will
lose their lives today.
'I have to save the innocent
from this macabre.'
'Enough of bloodshed, Dhananand.'
In our culture, food is worshipped.
That is because by consuming this food
we became healthy.
And if we are hale and hearty
then, the tolerance level increases.
And this tolerance level,
gives us success in life.
So, in our lives, we should not
underestimate the power of food
nor we should disrespect it.
Remember
that, those who respect food in life
they not only become
the master in life but along with it
they gain good health and also becomes
capable of having a successful life.
My ethics..
Your destiny.
Take all the weapons
under your control.
Stay alerted, Dhananand!
We not only wound your dignity
but also hurt the ego
of your brother Rashtrapal.

================================================================================

Episode: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qd3MwXl4-PI

Forgive us, Your Majesty.. Have mercy.
Rashtrapal, tell all of them
that you are going
to kill all of them.
Tell them.
Certainly.
The specialty of this weapon is
that it can release many
arrows at the same time.
Not just this.
We can also fix
the direction of the arrows.
And as soon as you pull the rope
my weapon will be ready
to release the arrows.
And thousands of arrows will
be released at the same time
to finish someone.
Forgive us, Your Majesty. Have mercy.
Have mercy, Your Majesty.
Forgive us, Your Majesty.
Have mercy, Your Majesty.
Forgive us, Your Majesty.
Have mercy, Your Majesty.
Forgive us, Your Majesty.
Have mercy, Your Majesty. Have mercy.

Forgive us, Your Majesty. Have mercy.

Forgive us, Your Majesty.
Have mercy, Your Majesty. Forgive us.
Have mercy, Your Majesty.
Forgive us, Your Majesty.
No.
I shall not let you
shed any more blood.
Your Majesty!
Hey..
Run..
Soldier.
Help..
No.
How is this possible?
Tara..
Run.. Run..
What are you all waiting for?
The one who has stopped us..
Kill the person with the same weapon.
Aim at the target.
After disappearing from
Magadh all of a sudden..
I am amazed
to see you here.
I am amazed to know
that you realised my absence.
I am shocked to know
that the person who is
always concerned about
victory and power can remember
an ordinary woman.
Tara, it was you who had left
without informing anybody, not me.
If you really missed me then
why did you not search me?
You are the king.
You could have searched me
in the universe if you wished to.
It was not difficult for you to search
an ordinary woman like me.
Tell me. Why did you not search me?
'Look for her everywhere.'
'You must search her everywhere,
not just in Magadh.'
'But you must get Tara. Go!'
'Tara. Tara..'
Yes, I did not search for you.
Because the king does not do all this.
Do not think even for a moment
that I have come for you.
I have come to Magadh for my mother.
And I do not wish to stay here
with you even for a moment.
You will not step out of the palace.
Understood?
Tarini has reached Magadh.
I just hope that very soon
she establishes a place
in Dhananand's palace.
Do not worry, Chandragupta.
She will surely succeed in doing that.
It seems we are ready for
the next phase of our plan.
Yes, Chandragupta.
I am just waiting for
the blacksmith's carriage
carrying the equipment required
to make Rashtrapal's weapon
to pass from here.
The wheels of the carriage are stuck.
Get them out.
Chandragupta and Acharya Chanakya!
Chandragupta, why are you doing this?
Acharya, they do not have
any right to live.
- Today, I will..
- Give me a chance to speak to them.
They will do as you say.
You will, right?
Yes.
My Lord, me and my workers
are like the ordinary labourers
who make the tools.
And our loyalty is like these weapons.
Our loyalty will be towards
those who keep us.
Kindly do not kill us, Acharya.
No.. He is not going to kill you.
Everyone, get up. Get up.
Even you all get up.
Listen, I am glad that you saved
your lives as well as our time
by directly coming to the point.
Now listen to me carefully.
You will make the weapons
for Chandragupta Maurya,
Prince of Piplivan
and not for Rashtrapal.
- Understood?
- Yes.
We accept your proposal.
Why do you want to keep me with you?
Why are you keen
on having me around you?
When you very well know
that I just hate you.
Hate?
Take a look at this flower, Tara.
It needs special type of soil,
air, and environment
to grow and thrive.
But hate..
But hate needs no special environment.
That is why you need
not go from here.
You will stay in this palace.
Even
if you hate me.
And what if the thorns
of my hatred hurt you?
I do not know why
but I feel that you will not harm me.
Behind this layer of fury
there is still love hidden
in your heart for me
even today.
Okay, then.
I'll stay right here
and will prove it to you
that, there is no love
but only hatred in my heart for you.
People like you who are of the opinion
that everything in the world
can be achieved with
the help of money and power
will face my presence
and my anger,
as a threat to their existence.
You can do whatever you wish
I will never be able to love you.
I have only one emotion
left in my heart for you
and that is, hatred.
I am sorry for the intrusion Emperor.
Your brother, Rashtrapal
wishes to see you, right now.
He has mentioned that, it is
very urgent for him to meet you.
Make arrangements
for her to stay, here.
And mind it.
She should not have
to face any troubles
during her stay, here.
'What is it, that Rashtrapal wants to
discuss with Dhananand, so urgently?'
'I must find out.'
Hey, bravehearts
of the Paurav dynasty.
I am very happy
that, we had a victory
without shedding blood, today.
Now, we have some talented
and skilled labourers with us too.
They are highly skilled craftsmen
in the art of making weapons.
They are experts.
All this has been possible
because of all of you.
Hence
I would like to thank each one of you.
We are ready to shed our
bloods in your service, Prince!
We are ready to shed our
bloods in your service, Prince!
Stay alerted, Dhananand!
One strike of ours
was enough not only
to wound your dignity
but also hurt the ego
of your brother Rashtrapal.
He must be seething with rage
because of this, strike of ours.
And, very soon
because of his frustration
he is going to take a hasty step
which will trap him
further in our plans.
I am boiling with fury all over.
I feel as if there is a deadly volcano
ready to explode inside my chest.
How dare, Chandragupta and Chanakya
strike at my craftsmen and labourers
who built weapons for us.
Get them arrested!
I will not spare them.
Brother Rashtrapal
come here.
Come to me.
How many times have I asked you to have
a better control over your anger?
Now stay here for some time.
This sweet smelling water will help you
to soothe and calm your senses.
- Emperor..
- Yes..
Now you seem to be fine.
Now, tell me what plans have you made
to give it back to that wretched
Chandragupta and Chanakya?
I will build a huge artillery
to produce weapons
in the outskirts of the Magadh state.
I have called for
the most skilled craftsmen
of the 14 Janpadas, Emperor.
Not only that
I have also called
for the chiefs of 14 Janpadas.
Under their able leadership
the work of building
the weapons will take place.
We will build weapons
that will be unique and different!
Weapons that will be unique
and different from others!
Now, you sound like my brother.
You only have just
one thing more to do.
In order to calm yourself down
you must stay for some
more time inside the water.
Emperor!
Nowadays, I am drawing lot of
inspiration from the plants and trees.
- Have you ever noticed creepers?
- Yes.
We get to learn from them
that, the creepers get
their nutrition from the walls
or plants around which
they tend to offshoot.
Similarly, that wretched
Chandragupta and Chanakya
are flourishing around a wall
called Paurav dynasty.
What if we cut their source
once and for all?
Excellent!
I got it.
What does he mean by saying
that he will eliminate the pillar
of Paurav Dynasty?
I must inform this to Chandragupta
and Acharya Chanakya right away.
Acharya
what is the meaning of the message
that Tarini has brought?
What conspiracy is Dhananand plotting
against Paurav Dynasty?
The king is the pillar of any nation.
Dhananand is talking about eliminating
the pillar of Paurav Dynasty.
That means,
Malayketu's life is in danger.
Chandragupta, you know
what you are supposed to do.
Certainly, Acharya.
Wait, Chandra, I will join you.
Your Highness, we should go
to the president's arms
manufacturing camp without any delay.
We should give a fitting
answer to Dhananand
for conspiring against Paurav Dynasty.
Please come.
Chandragupta
I am coming
to defeat you!
Hail Lord Shiva!
If you make the Brahmins wait
our fury will destroy
your king Malayketu
in no time!
Call him immediately!
Hail Lord Shiva!
Sorry for the delay.
King Malayketu himself is coming
to welcome and honour you.
- Please come.
- Hail Lord Shiva!
Princess Durdhara, open the door.
You are forgetting
that I am your bodyguard.
You cannot escape from me even
for a second. Open the door!
Why is Princess Durdhara not opening
the door for her bodyguard?
If he spots me inside the palace
then my plot against Dhananand will
go in vain even before I execute it.
Listen, where is King Malayketu?
He is treating a few Brahmins
with some food.
He is treating Brahmins!
Who is this Brahmin
having lunch at this hour?
'I am sure it is a conspiracy
by Dhananand.'
A dew drop is sweet and pure.
But a single drop
is not sufficient to quench
someone's thirst.
On the other hand,
ocean has so much water
but it cannot quench someone's thirst
due to its salty nature.
The quality to quench someone's thirst
exists only in the river waters.
Similarly, in life
virtues and accomplishments
are not the only things that matter.
But
we need to
strike a balance between these two.
My ethics..
Your destiny.
Take the young king
of the Paurav Dynasty.

================================================================================

Episode: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PO6rjwRWprk

Brahmins, have food.
No.
We will not have
a single grain of this food
till your king comes and serves us.
And if your king is so busy
that he cannot come to the feast
for Brahmins and serve the Brahmins
then okay.
We are also not eager
to have his food.
We will not stay in a kingdom
which does not have respect, honour
and hospitality towards the Brahmins.
Let us go from here.
I am sorry.
The Paurav king has arrived.
I am sorry, Brahmin.
I was busy with some
work of the council.
Please take your seat
and accept our food and hospitality.
Okay.
Take the young king
of the Paurav Dynasty.
Chandragupta.
Royal Guru.
Royal Guru!
What is all this?
Royal Guru, where is Malayketu?
Chandragupta, the Paurav king
kidnapped Malayketu.
Their intention was
to kidnap the Paurav king.
This Brahmin has to be Amatya Rakshas
and not anybody else.
They would not have gone very far.
We will have to find him very soon
before they cross the border
of the Paurav Dynasty.
Ambikumar, I told you
that this is my time to have bath.
Princess Durdhara, it is me, Tarini.
Tarini?
Stop. Why have you come here?
What if the king sees you?
And how did you come here?
This is not the time
to discuss all this.
Just understand that I have come here
as Chandragupta
and Acharya Chanakya's informer.
But there is one problem here.
Ambikumar?
He had seen you fighting
on Lady Mura and my side.
Am I right?
Princess Durdhara.
I hope you have completed your bath.
No. I want some more time.
Leave from the back door of this room.
Hurry up.
I will ensure that Ambikumar
does not block you path.
Come on.
Open the door.
Otherwise, I will have to
inform King Dhananand.
Good. Very good.
I am very happy.
Stulbhadra.
Chandra, did you find Malayketu?
No, Stulbhadra.
We did not find
the Paurav king anywhere.
Did you find him?
We did not find
the Paurav king anywhere.
Did you find him?
We also did not find
the Paurav king anywhere.
All of our search teams
have returned unsuccessful.
We are not getting any information
about Malayketu from anywhere.
I wonder why Dhananand
kidnapped Malayketu.
To put me in a dilemma
so that I bow down to him.
What are you trying to say, Chandra?
Stulbhadra,
I have understood Dhananand's plan.
The riddle that I was
not able to understand..
I am understanding everything clearly
after Malayketu's kidnapping.
Do you remember the incident
between me and the king of Avanti
when he had invited us
for food to his palace?
Yes. I remember.
'Your Majesty,
thank you for this meal.'
'But the queen and prince
of Avanti are not to be seen.'
'Lady Mura is eager to meet them.'
'W-Well, the prince
is not in Avanti right now.'
'He has gone out of the kingdom
for army training.'
'And the queen has
also gone with him.'
What is the connection between
Malayketu's kidnapping
and the prince of Avanti
going for army training?
There is a connection, Stulbhadra.
There is a deep connection.
The chiefs of the 14 districts
not attending Malayketu's
coronation ceremony
and not supporting us
in ending Dhananand's cruel reign
makes it clear
that Dhananand has held
their heirs captive.
Their prince..
I mean, his life
is in Dhananand's hands now.
'I am sorry.'
'But due to an unfortunate reason'
'I am unable to attend the united India's
festival and the coronation ceremony'
'of the Paurav king.'
'I am sorry for my absence.'
'Let it be, Chandragupta.'
'The same thing would have
been written in this too.'
You are trying to say
that the king of Avanti lied to us.
Yes.
That is why he betrayed us
because he was helpless.
This is not it.
I am sure that not just
the son of the king of Avanti
but that cruel Dhananand
might have kidnapped the sons
of the other heads too
just how he has kidnapped Malayketu.
This is..
This is Dhananand's trump card
due to which all the heads
are not able to muster
the courage to go against him
and nobody is supporting us
because their future
and the future of India
are under the control of Dhananand.
Yes.
The future of India.
Today is a special day.
What happened?
I do not know why all of you
are so scared of me.
Do not worry.
I will not tell you anything.
All of you do not know
how precious all of you are to me.
I have control over the 14 districts
because of all of you.
Take this. Have 'Kheer'.
Which king would want
his successor and his son
to die at my hands?
Who would want this?
That is the reason
I take good care of you
and offer you tasty foods.
Come on. Eat Kheer.
I accept.. I accept that you are kids.
But royal blood is going
through your veins.
I am sure that my plan..
No..
You must have understood
my brilliant plan.
You have understood, right?
You have understood, right?
Yes..
We have understood, Your Highness.
The prince of Avanti..
I am very impressed
with your dedication.
Like you, even your father
will never go against me.
Everyone will dance
to my tunes like puppets.
And they will
do what I say.
Am I right?
Am I right?
I am so intelligent.
Magadh is so intelligent. Am I right?
Dhananand knows that Malayketu
is on our side.
And it is a fact
that the revolt in Takshashila
and Paurav Kingdom
is bothering him.
In order to give them
a befitting reply
he has played the same trick even here
to keep the heads of the kingdom
under his control.
Dhananand wants Takshashila
and Paurav Kingdom
to bow down before him
like other kingdoms.
Prince Chandragupta
please go to the watchtower
immediately.
Magadh army!
The food was tasty, right?
It was bound to be.
Today is such a special day.
So the food was bound to be tasty.
Anyway, leave it. It is not
important how the food was.
The message is important
which I am going to give you now.
You are kids. It is obvious
that you will be curious.
Someone will
join you.
Charioteer, faster.
We have to reach Magadh
as soon as possible.
Faster!
And that companion
is about to meet you.
But do not become
too friendly with him.
He will not be here for a long time.
Poor Chandragupta!
What will he do now?
He is caught between the devil
and the deep blue sea.
He will not be able
to do anything now.
Now he has now way to escape this.
Chandra, we are surrounded
by Magadh army.
Paurav Kingdom is surrounded by them.
Dhananand has attacked us
from both the sides.
On one hand,
he has abducted Malayketu.
On the other hand if I go out
of Paurav Kingdom now
there is no one who can lead
Takshashila and Paurav Kingdom.
And Magadh army will capture
both the kingdoms.
But Chandra, if you do not go
our plan will fail.
What will we do now?
Queen Mura has arrived.
Mother?
Warriors of Paurav kingdom
and Takshashila
King Malayketu has been abducted.
And the army of Magadh
is posing danger to you.
I know, the enemy stands
on your motherland.
But do not forget that all of you
are Kshatriya warriors!
Each Kshatriya warrior
is capable of killing
100 enemy soldiers!
They are capable of protecting
the honour of their motherland!
Do not forget that it was you
who freed your motherland
from the clutches of a cunning
and evil foreigner king like Seleucus.
Then it was Seleucus
and today it is Dhananand!
Dhananand has come
to enslave your motherland.
The time has come for us to unite
and throw Dhananand
away from our motherland!
I, Queen of Piplivan
will guide you on every step.
Are you all with me!
Yes, we are with you!
Yes, we will fight!
Yes, we are with you!
Yes, we will fight!
Yes, we are with you!
Yes, we will fight!
Yes, we are with you!
Yes, we will fight!
Yes, we are with you!
Mother.
Mother, why are you here?
Acharya's spies informed him
about this attack.
When he got the information, he knew
that Dhananand's double strike
was to put you in a dilemma.
That is why he sent me
here to help you.
Mother, how will you alone lead
Takshashila and Paurav kingdom?
Chandra, the future king of united India
would need many warriors
who can stand shoulder
to shoulder with him
and share the burden
of his responsibilities.
So that the king himself
can achieve other important goals.
You have to do the same now.
Go and foil Dhananand's devious plan.
Let me handle the situation here.
But, Mother,
if I got delayed in getting
Malayketu freed..
Chandra,
I will fight till my last breath.
I will not let the enemy cross
the border of Paurav kingdom.
That I promise to you.
Go and attain your goal.
Be victorious.
A mountain can cast its shadow
on the whole forest.
It can cover the forest in darkness.
But as the sunlight spreads
that same shadow starts weakening.
And when the sun is at its zenith
that shadow disappears from existence.
In life too, our domination and time
are related like
that mountain and sun.
As the time changes
our shadow, meaning our dominion
over people around us
sometimes increases
and sometimes decreases.
That is why, even if you are unyielding
and powerful like a mountain
always be polite.
Because time can change
the situation any moment.
My ethics..
Your destiny.
Now, I will rescue
all the princes including Malayketu.
There are two persons in
Dhananand's palace who will help you
Durdhara and Tarini.
Whose message is that?

================================================================================

Episode: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2xfgZFDQkY

Everything is happening
as per my expectation.
This weapon manufacturing camp
will turn out to be your graveyard,
Rashtrapal.
Hurry up.
Greetings.
Are you seeing, the King of Avanti?
These expert blacksmiths
who came from 14 kingdoms
are making weapons
for Dhananand's army.
And this is happening because..
Because Chandragupta and Acharya
have seized the materials
required for manufacturing weapons
and held the expert
blacksmiths captive.
I do not like someone interrupting
When I speak then everyone
else should listen.
Your anger is like an active volcano,
Rashtrapal.
Forgive me.
This will not happen again.
Remember one thing.
You should not make
any mistake in this camp.
You and the other
heads of the kingdoms
will keep an eye on everything here.
And everything will happen
here under your supervision.
If you make a mistake
someone else will get
punished for the same.
No, please do not punish him.
I will not commit any mistake.
There must be a way
which will help the heads
of the kingdoms to get rid
of their fear for Dhananand.
Acharya, as per your instruction
50 sacks of coal are ready.
Good. Now, do one more thing.
Transform coal into powder.
I know that you are
shocked after hearing this.
You must be wondering
how I will destroy the camp
using coal powder.
But trust me.
You will understand everything
at the right time.
Now, just do what I say.
Go and distribute these
attires and jewelleries
among the poor citizens of Magadh.
I do not need any royal favour.
If you touch anything
you will lose your hand.
Incredible!
You are so brave!
You have displayed great courage
by intimidating a poor slave.
Fear works as an important
tool to run a kingdom successfully
and efficiently, Tara.
But you will not understand.
Because you were
never scared of me.
Yes.
Because I have only one
feeling for you in my heart.
And that is hatred.
That is for the time being.
But I am sure that your hatred
will transform into
love very soon, Tara.
Why have you come here?
I have come here because
I am very happy today.
My every plan is turning
out to be successful.
I have come here to
share my thoughts with you
as I used to do earlier.
That is the reason I sent you gifts.
By the way, you keep saying
that you hate me.
I have come here to show you
what will happen to that person
whom I hate the most.
Come with me.
Come with me, Tara.
If you do not go out of this chamber
I will vent out my
anger on your slaves.
Soldiers, make sure
that all the distinguished citizens
of Magadh are present in the market.
Because it will be such
an incredible spectacle
that everyone should witness that.
Especially,
my beloved sister, Durdhara.
'What is Dhananand up to?'
Dhananand has made a big
mistake by abducting Malayketu.
Now, I will rescue
all the princes including Malayketu.
I will bring them here
and unite them to their fathers.
Rescuing all the princes
including Malayketu
will be a great victory for us,
Chandragupta.
If we can unite the heads
of the kingdoms with their sons
they will get rid of
their fear for Dhananand.
And I am sure they will help us
in the battle against Dhananand.
- But remember one thing.
- There will be no direct attack.
First, I will weaken
Dhananand's associates.
After that, I will move towards
the centre gradually just like
the way Khichri should be consumed.
Please rest assured, Acharya.
I will not forget this.
There are two persons in
Dhananand's palace who will help you
Durdhara and Tarini.
Dhananand will never suspect them.
They will help you
to achieve your goal.
When you will rescue
Malayketu and other princes
I will destroy
Dhananand's brother Rashtrapal's
weapon manufacturing camp.
We will strike Dhananand
twice simultaneously.
I hope you are ready.
'Malayketu.'
Ladies and gentlemen
I am presenting
the king of Paurav Kingdom
Malayketu, in front of you.
He is not only my enemy
but also the friend
of my biggest enemy.
He hatched conspiracies
against me several times
with the help of Chandragupta.
But this time..
This time, they will be
the reason of each other's end.
Come here drum players.
What are you looking at?
Play the drums.
Listen..
Chandragupta, Malayketu's
friend listen to me carefully.
If you do not surrender within one day
then this friend of yours
will be attacked with
the most powerful weapon
I have.
Amatya.
Chandragupta, very soon
we will shoot so many arrows
into your friend
that he will bleed
till his death.
You should feel ashamed.
Are you using this boy
as you cannot fight
with your enemy straight?
Dhananand, you have stooped
very low by doing this.
If you actually think of yourself
as a powerful and great king
let this boy go
and fight with Chandragupta
like a warrior.
Tell me, are you capable of that?
You say that you
feel disgusted about me.
But you have no idea
how much
I hate Chandragupta.
Crushing him under
my feet is my motive.
And when this storm calms
you will know
why I did this
and then you will experience
your true feelings
and you will come back to me.
Amatya, you must make sure
that Chandragupta
knows about every step
which Malay takes towards his death.
I want our message
to reach Chandragupta well.
As you say, sire.
I will be happy to do that.
'If you do not surrender
within one day'
'then this friend of yours'
'will be attacked with
the most powerful weapon'
'I have.'
'Dhananand has confined the kings of
all the kingdoms in this very palace.'
'Even Malayketu will be
locked in the same dungeon.'
'Where all of the other kingdom's
princes have been locked.'
Whose message is that?
Whose message is that?
Give it to me.
I am sure that you know this.
I am the special guest of the king
to whom you are a servant.
It does not matter how important
someone is for the king.
When it comes to his security
Amatya Rakshas does not spare anyone.
Pass me that message. Do it!
What is going on here?
I apologise, sire.
I know you will not allow this.
But I have a valid
reason to doubt on her.
I am sure that she is
secretly exchanging
messages with someone.
And as per your direction
nobody can do this
apart from you here.
Hence, for the sake of your safety
I will not let anyone do this.
I give you the permission
to check this special guest of mine.
What?
Anyway
she has expressed it time and again
as to how much she hates me.
And coming back to me
after so long
does invoke suspicions, Amatya.
Read that out, Amatya.
'Tara, my dear daughter.'
'I am sure you have found
a way to escape from Magadh by now.'
'I do not want that..'
Read it without any
hesitation, Amatya.
Sure, sire.
'I do not even want that
evil Dhananand to be around you.'
'You have faced many
difficulties because of him.'
Now that you have supported
Amatya's suspicion
you must shower your mercy
on my respect and dignity too.
What do you want me to do?
I want you
to bring my mother's message
to me personally.
Hey!
- Stay in your limits..
- Amatya..
You are so unsafe in spite of being
such a power and great king.
You do not
trust anyone.
Your Majesty, why did you let her go?
Keep quiet.
Okay.
I will have to inform
Durdhara immediately
about the kidnapping of the children
and Chandragupta's arrival.
Stulbhadra, the moment other soldiers
arrive in place of these soldiers
we will begin our plan of saving
Malayketu and the other children.
I am sure
that Tarini would have
received my message by now.
Do not worry, Chandra.
We have a lot of time.
But yes,
be extra careful about one thing.
What!
You are going to meet
Durdhara after many days.
Do not get lost in her eyes
and get distracted from your goal.
Do not say stupid things, Stulbhadra.
I have not even thought about this.
Really?
Chandra, you can fool yourself.
But not your best friend.
The way you jumped on the horse
it was clear at that moment itself
that apart from this goal
there is something else too that
is bringing you back to this place.
Stulbhadra..
Chandragupta,
no matter where you are hiding
consider this as your
final warning from the king.
These are the last three
hours of your warning.
If you do not surrender
yourself before the king
in the next six hours
your friend, Malayketu,
will be given a death sentence
by King Dhananand in
the centre of the kingdom.
Chandra, what do we do now?
Our plan depended on the fact
that these soldiers will go from here.
But they will take
a long time to leave.
And we do not have so much time.
How will we enter the palace now?
All the secret doors have
also been closed, Chandra.
There is one more way
to enter Magadh's palace.
We will have to go there immediately.
Come with me.
She is looking beautiful now.
Add some colour to her cheeks
and these black eyes
like a sea..
I wonder how much
pain is hidden in them.
And her hair should come till here.
Do it.
Your Majesty.
Soldiers,
I do not want to see his face today.
Take him from here.
It is a request, Your Majesty.
I have an important information
regarding the Paurav Dynasty.
Your Majesty, our army could not cross
the border of the Paurav Dynasty
because Mura is leading
the armies of Takshashila
and the Paurav Dynasty.
And Chandragupta is nowhere
in the Paurav Dynasty.
He was not spotted in Magadh too.
Where could that traitor be?
And where is my brother, Rashtrapal?
Your Majesty,
he is in the weapon making camp
with the heads of the 14 districts.
You stay here
and be careful, Amatya.
I have to do an important work.
Chandra, are you sure
that this would be right?
Stulbhadra,
I am thinking of a different idea
to distract these soldiers.
Chandra, I am not worried
that you are entering the tunnel.
I am worried about where
you are going from the tunnel.
This tunnel opens directly
at Dhananand's room.
I know, Stulbhadra.
But the question is not
about one or two district.
This is the future of united India.
And these children
are the future of India.
But, Chandra,
you are also the future of this India.
Stulbhadra, I am going inside
because these are the last three hours
to save Malayketu
and the other children.
Take this.
Exactly after three hours
meet me with Baggi at
the place that I have told you.
Okay?
Be quiet.
I just heard some noise. Let us go.
'If you do not surrender yourself'
'before the king
in the next six hours'
'your friend, Malayketu,
will be given a death sentence'
'by King Dhananand in
the centre of the kingdom.'
Chandragupta has left
to save all the princes.
Now, it is time for us
to begin working on our plan.
Remember one thing, brave people.
Our mission of destroying
Rashtrapal's weapon making camp
will be successful
only when you are completely covered
in the black colour of this charcoal.
Yes, Acharya.
But, Acharya, what is the plan?
Plan?
Look up.
Today is a new moon night.
And Rashtrapal's weapon making camp is
on the border of the forest
where you will be visible
just like a shadow
after being covered
in this black colour.
Black shadows
who will destroy this camp very soon.
Why are you following
me like a shadow?
Will you not let me pray in peace
for the departed soul of my father?
Being your bodyguard I have
to carry out my duties to protect you.
Do not worry. I will not interfere
in your prayers for your father.
'Feather of a peacock?'
'Tarani has a message
sent by Chandragupta.'
'I need to get rid of this idiot.'
'But how?'
'Close your eyes and try'
'to remember your father.'
'Until you chant the hymns 11 times'
'till then, do not open your eyes.'
Ambikumar.
Bring your hands together
and close your eyes.
Why? Are you going
to gift me something?
Stop talking nonsense.
As I said, bring your hands together,
close your eyes
and to pay homage to my father,
chant the hymns after me.
He was your father..
You give him the respect, not me.
He is not only my father
but also the father of the Emperor..
The same Emperor whom you call God.
He will not like you
disrespecting his father.
'My divine God..'
What!
Is Chandragupta coming here
to save Malay and the other children?
Yes.
But we do not know where has Dhananand
held the children captive.
We are losing on time, Durdhara.
We need to help Chandragupta.
Maybe I know where the king
has held the children captive.
Good!
Then, you must be knowing which main
entry will Chandragupta take to enter.
He can gain access in the palace
only through one entry.
Which entry point?
From the tunnel
which opens up in
the chamber of the king.
Who is inside the tunnel?
Good Lord!
The king should not have
gone to his chamber now.
Come what may, the king
should not arrest Chandragupta.
Durdhara, Chandragupta is very brave.
He cannot get caught so easily.
You do not know how sinister
is the king, Tarani.
I know him very well.
Come out!
Let me go inside.
I will think of something.
You are not going anywhere. Stay here.
I have so many enemies.
I have to be careful.
My patience is wearing thin.
What are you doing here?
Where is your bodyguard?
He..
He failed in a test I gave him.
I have not time for your balderdash.
Your doubt is right, Your Highness.
Amatya, if that imbecile
does not show up
you know what to do.
Of course, Your Highness.
Let us go inside the chamber.
I think
you should spend some
time alone with him.
Why did you cut the rope?
Why did you do that?
This was my only way
to keep you focused on your goal.
The day you attain your goal
and finish your duty
for your motherland
we will become one.
Until then
I will stay here and help you.
This is what is good for me
Chandra.
We don't have any time at all.
Come.
I will take everyone
where Malay and other children
have been kept as captives.
Let's go.
Soldiers!
Close all the doors of the palace.
Until the Emperor returns
no one will either go out or come in.
Position a soldier outside every room.
The whole palace must be
under a security blanket. Go!
Before all the palace doors are closed
we must reach the prison.
Do you know
what we have in common?
Yes. Both of us
are very close to the Emperor.
Soldiers.. come here.
You have destroyed my whole garden.
Every flower there is withering away.
Didn't you take care
of it in my absence?
Then what's the use
of having all of you here?
Everyone will come with me right away
and take care of my dear flowers.
Understood?
Let's go.
All of you will help me out. Go.
Princess,
we are all ready to serve you.
But, right now, according
to the Prime Minister's orders
we have to guard the
different rooms of the palace.
Okay. This will be your decision
as to whose orders you will follow.
The emperor's dear sister
or the prime minister's.
The emperor may or may not
favor the same person forever.
Okay princess,
we will follow your orders.
Let's go.
Didn't the Emperor order
you to prepare my royal bath?
Has everything arranged
for the special bath?
But, you had said that you didn't have
any interest in any of the
Emperor's gifts or preferences.
Yes, but now I have changed my ideas.
Now, I want to have
that bath right now.
What?
Yes. Get that ready.
Or I will tell the Emperor that
there is no importance
of his orders in this palace.
No..madam.
We will get everything ready
for your royal bath right away.
Let's go.
This is the same place
where I have seen the soldiers taking
away empty food vessels many times.
There is no arrangement
for food for these soldiers here.
What do you mean?
This mean that these soldiers
are not stationed here.
They guard this place
only at scheduled times.
You were right. They are going.
This is the time.
If we don't do it now,
we can never do it again.
Oh brave warriors,
spread in all directions.
Okay, Acharya..
What is this tremor?
Dhananand?
After going around constantly,
this charka
converts the cotton
into a strong thread.
Similarly, with constant efforts
we must gain new experiences
because these new experiences
make us better with each passing day
and this helps us to be successful
in our life in different ways.
My ethics..
Your destiny.
You are the king's main guest
who has returned to Magadh
after many years.
The king has no idea
about your reality.
I will go and tell
the king that his lover
is a spy sent by Chandragupta.

================================================================================

Episode: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20Awr8FCij4

Come! The way is clear.
Malayketu, are you okay?
Chandra, you have freed us from this
but there is no way out of here.
Amatya has closed all the gates.
What will we do now, Chandra?
There must be a way out of here.
Listen, which way does
Dhananand use to come here?
I am not completely sure
but he always comes
from that direction.
This path..
Where does this path go?
This path leads to Dhananand's room.
Durdhara,
go ahead and ensure that there is
no soldier present inside
and outside Dhananand's room.
Go quickly.
Princess!
Princess!
Oh, so you fooled me to get rid of me.
Princess Durdhara,
I said, open the door!
Where is Princess Durdhara?
I do not know, Prince.
What are you doing here?
If the king is not in the palace
it does not mean
you can waste your time.
Go and guard my room.
Keep in mind,
Ambikumar must not get out of there.
I do not want him around me. Got it?
But, Princess, he is your bodyguard.
I do not need such
a bodyguard. Go now.
The way is clear. Come.
Malay, come.
Soldiers, did you see
Princess Durdhara anywhere?
Yes, we saw the princess
outside the king's chamber.
And she ordered us to not
to let you out of your room.
Durdhara! Move!
You! What are you doing here?
Oh, now I understand.
You are the king's main guest who has
returned to Magadh after many years.
And it is clear that the
king has no idea about your reality.
But no problem.
I will finish this task.
I will go and tell
the king that his lover
is a spy sent by Chandragupta.
And, Chandragupta
when I will present the king's
biggest enemy in front of him
he will be pleased with me
and give me many gifts.
God, this is the best day of my life.
My fortune is about to change today,
Chandragupta Mauyra.
Look, friend..
Now that you have got caught
you are calling me a friend.
This is for hurting my Durdhara.
This is for following her
for day and night.
And this one for eyeing her
in the wrong way.
And this is for wanting to marry
my Durdhara.
Tarini, why did you this?
Let me kill him. That would be right.
You are getting emotional,
Chandragupta.
Killing him would cause suspicion.
And we do not want that.
You remember our plan, right?
We cannot attract
any attention to ourselves.
You think he will
not reveal our truth?
I will handle all this.
Go and rescue Durdhara and the kids.
Love for his son
can make a person do anything.
Are you seeing, Brother Rashtrapal?
The King of Avanti,
the King of the kingdom
the Emperor of the kingdom..
What is he doing
whose efficient leadership
transformed his kingdom
into a great kingdom?
He has transformed into a slave
from a great king.
I am sure
that he can do anything
for the sake of his son.
If I ask him to lick his own spit
he will do the same.
Am I right, the King of Avanti?
Your Highness, I will take leave now.
I will go and supervise
the sword manufacturing unit.
As long as I am surrounded
by people like him
I do not need the security
provided by you, Your Highness.
It is more than enough for me
that you are concerned
for my security and well-being.
Brother Rashtrapal
I am your brother first.
As you know, it is my right and duty
to provide you security.
As far as my two enemies
Chandragupta and Chanakya
are concerned
I do not want to take any risk.
Do not worry. Come with me.
I will show you such a weapon
which will make Chandragupta
and Chanakya bite the dust.
What will we do now, Acharya?
How will we counter Magadh's big army?
Do not worry. We just need to make
sure that they are not able to see us.
Have you seen this coconut?
Collect coconuts as much as you can.
We will use its peel as firewood
in that furnace.
And we will generate so much smoke
that Magadh army will not be able
to see anything for a brief period.
I will be right back.
- Where are you going, Acharya?
- Me?
I am going to meet a father.
So that I can unite him to his son.
After some time, he will help us
to burn Rashtrapal's Lanka down.
All of you, collect coconuts.
Chandra, hurry up.
We are heading towards
our end with each passing second.
You must have rescued Malayketu
and other kids by now.
Please come fast.
Malayketu, listen to me carefully.
Only one person can go
at a time through this tunnel.
And there are several
sharp edges in this tunnel.
Enter the tunnel carefully.
But I will not go first.
What do you mean?
These people..
they suffered more than me.
Hence, they have the
first right to become free.
Not mine.
- But Malay..
- It is a request.
We should not waste
our time arguing on this.
They will enter first.
And I will enter at last.
Okay.
The prince of Avanti, come.
Keep moving ahead after
entering the tunnel.
You are not supposed
to stop or return here.
In the other end of the tunnel
my friend, Stul,
is waiting for you with a cart.
Go.
The prince of Avanti,
do not be scared.
Just keep moving forward.
Where is Ambikumar? Find him.
According to the king's order
he had to see death punishment
of Malayketu with me.
Where is he?
Tarini..
Come with me.
Ambikumar.
Ambikumar, what happened?
Who is responsible for this?
Answer me.
Tarini..
In the chamber of the emperor..
Ambikumar.
Take him to a physician immediately.
Go.
'Tarini..'
Why does he keep taking Tarini's name?
Let us go to the
chamber of the emperor.
'I need to inform Chandragupta soon.'
Now, the second person
can enter the tunnel.
Come on. Hurry up.
Chandragupta,
you need to stop this immediately.
Amatya Rakshas is coming here.
What!
'Tarini..'
'In the chamber of the emperor..'
'Whose message is this?'
'Whether the emperor
believes it or not'
'but I am sure'
'that Tarini is hiding
something from the emperor.'
'But what is she hiding?'
'I will have to find
it out at any cost.'
No, I cannot leave
Malay here for dying.
There must be a solution
of this problem.
It will be impossible to rescue
these kids if Dhananand learns
about our failed mission.
And he will become more careful.
And the heads of
the 14 kingdoms of India
will have no choice
but to dance to his tunes.
Do not worry for me. I can understand.
The future emperor of united India
will have to take
some harsh decisions.
For the bright future
of my motherland..
For a united India..
It will be an honour
for me to die for my country.
Malay, do you trust me?
Without doubt, Chandra.
I believe in you more than myself.
I promise that tonight
I will give you freedom.
Even you all will be free
but as of now, you all
have to go back to the dungeons.
'Chandragupta has closed the tunnel.'
'Your son is free from
the clutches of Dhananand.'
'If you want to meet your son'
'then come to the mountain
behind the camps..'
'Vishnugupta.'
Your Highness,
this is my favourite weapon.
I am delighted by your work,
Brother Rashtrapal.
But still,
I would want you to be alert
because that imbecile
and that devious monk
can attack from any sides.
Do not worry, Your Highness.
I will take care of things
here and be on the lookout.
By the way, the orders you
gave to Chandragupta to surrender..
That time has gone by.
That is why I have to go, Brother.
It is time to give the
death sentence to Malayketu.
What now?
Now, we..
We need to hide.
Princess, what made you come here?
What are you doing in
the chamber of the Emperor?
Actually, when the emperor
is not in his chamber
then, I come here frequently.
I come here to recollect
my pleasant memories
which I had spent
with him as a sister.
But what are you doing here?
Has any problem cropped up?
No.
There are no problems.
How will we save Malay
and the children now?
It is time for him
for his death penalty.
Dhananand wants to kill Malayketu
with the special weapon
made by Rashtrapal.
Yes.
A weapon from which a barrage
of arrows can be rained together.
I have a plan!
But for that, I need magnets.
I know from where we will get them.
Good! Leave quickly
and meet me at the death sentence
place with those magnets.
Hurry up!
Let us go.
I hope
by now Avantikumar
must have met Stulbhadra.
Why has anybody not come outside?
Any moment,
Malayketu will be put to death.
Go and hide there.
In the meantime,
I will help the other children.
- Nobody is coming.
- What do you mean?
Yes. Chandragupta
has closed the tunnel.
God have mercy!
This means, there is a problem.
Okay. Come.
I will take you to your father.
You lied to me.
No, King Avanti.
I did not lie to you.
Then, where is my son?
Why is he not here?
If you have done this to
take vengeance for my betrayal
then you are more
wicked and cruel than me.
Chanakya, how..
How can you play with the emotions
of a helpless father?
Do not worry, King Avanti.
Along with other children
of the legislators
Chandragupta will
be bringing your son here
without any casualties.
'Chandragupta has not
returned with Stulbhadra.'
'This means,
my plan has suffered a setback.'
Acharya, the task of freeing
Malayketu and other children
has to be stopped by Chandragupta.
I knew it!
It is not easy to free them
from the clutches of Dhananand.
Okay..
For this effort of yours,
I have nothing to say
but I will not inform the
army of Magadh that you are here.
Apart from this,
do not expect anything from me.
Father!
King Avanti.
You are lucky
to see your son alive..
To hug him close to your heart.
That is because
the children of the legislators
are still captive under Dhananand.
You are right.
Please forgive me for suspecting you.
I am ready to assist
and help in any way.
I got back my son.
I have nothing to fear now.
King Avanti.
You will help me
in destroying Rashtrapal his camps
filled with his weapons.
Durdhara, we stole the
magnets from Dhananand's chariot
but I do not understand something.
Why would he have
magnets on his chariot?
It is because an
astrologer told him once
that if attaches magnets
to the wheels of his chariots
he would become a great and
powerful emperor of the country.
I never thought Dhananand
would become so superstitious
while chasing his ambitions.
Tell me something, Tarini.
Do you still have any
feelings left for the emperor?
I am trying to save the
children from Dhananand's wrath.
I am going against him.
This proves that I do not
have any feelings for him anymore.
We have to get the magnets
to Chandragupta immediately.
Be quick! We do not have much time.
They will bring Malayketu here.
And that is where the rope
of the weapon will be pulled
to fire it.
And that is where Chanakya
will have to enter from.
Have you brought the magnet?
How will you save
Malayketu using the magnet?
Leave that to me.
Acharya has taught me
many skills to defeat enemies.
We just have to wait for Dhananand
and Malayketu to come here.
We have made all the preparations
to defeat Chandragupta.
I am very excited for
what will take place today.
Today, Chandragupta
will be insulted in public
when his favourite Malayketu dies.
This will put fear in
the mind of not only Magadh
but entire India!
Malayketu..
Your end is near.
When a Kshatriya's blood is spilled,
I experience
satisfaction and extreme joy.
Amatya.
Put him in shackles.
Come on!
Something seems different here.
Yes, Dhananand,
something is different.
You want to kill me
but none of them have fear
for you in their eyes.
It is because everyone knows
that they will someday
be freed of the shackles
and breathe in the open air
of independent India.
Is that so?
Breathe in the open air?
I will
show you what fear is.
Take him away.
My brave friends,
the time to attack has come.
With my count of three,
everyone will attack.
One.
Two.
Three.
Soldiers, get ready!
Our camp is under attack!
- Find the enemy!
- Charge!
Be quick..
Get out of the camp!
Why did you tell
the blacksmiths to run?
Did you not hear what Rashtrapal said?
Our camp has been attacked.
I cannot leave people here to die.
Chandragupta?
Go in that direction..
Wonderful!
These amazing weapons
give me immense joy!
Yes. The terror of Dhananand is over.
Avanti..
You have become so blind in rage,
Rashtrapal
that you do not see your real enemy.
Here he comes.
King Purushhottam's son Malayketu.
- Rakshas.
- Yes, my King?
Where is Durdhara?
Here you go.
Be quick. Go.
Yours forever and always.
Only yours.
Yours forever and always.
Only yours.
We will be done with
everything very soon.
I promise you.
And
Tara was supposed to be here as well.
Where is everyone, Rakshas?
My King, I want to tell you something.
What is it, Rakshas?
I feel like Tara..
Wonderful!
Very good!
You have arranged a grand
event for murdering a child.
Truly
you are a great emperor, Dhananand.
As deep as my love is
my hatred too is very deep, Tara.
And no one knows that better than you.
'Acharya, how will you kill
Rashtrapal inside his camp?'
'He has all the best
weapons in this world.'
'I am aware that he
has the best weapons.'
'But the weapon I have'
'is superiors than
his entire arsenal.'
'His anger is my weapon.'
'And thanks to this weapon'
'there is no need to attack him.'
'I just have to dodge his attacks.'
'Which will enrage him to no end.'
'And in turn,
he will definitely make a mistake'
'and he'll land in my trap.'
'Do you remember, I always say..'
'An angry person'
'becomes his own demise.'
A strong warrior such as yourself
one who is known as
'Magadh's' 'Biswakarma'.
The favorite brother
and the elder brother Rashtrapal
of King Dhananand
failed to strike a common sage?
No problem.
Try again. Come on.
No way!
You know I think I made a wrong
evaluation of your capabilities.
There is no way you are the pillar
of strength in Dhananand's empire.
Just look at yourself.
You are shaking like a leaf.
Strike me with some force. Come on!
Right.
I figured out your problem.
I think the sword is
a little too heavy for you.
Obviously you never worked hard.
No problem. I have a solution.
I will slow down my movements.
Give it another shot. Come on.
You rode with your
anger throughout your life.
Thousands of innocents
lost their lives
because of your temper.
Therefore
you too shall burn
and die with your temper
Rashtrapal.
We need the light from the lamp
to navigate through darkness.
All though the lamp cannot eradicate
all of the darkness
it emits enough light
which enables us
to keep moving forward.
It is the same deal in life.
Just like the endless darkness
sometimes we face problems
and hardship in life
that are difficult to
eradicate in a single try.
In which case,
like the light from the lamp
we need to find a little motivation
that will guide us in life
until we rise above our problems.
My ethics..
Your destiny.
Chandragupta, I gave you a day's time
to surrender yourself!
It's already past now.
Malayketu, be prepared for your death!
Soldiers! Attack!

================================================================================

Episode: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sQYgphN5Kk

You have spent all your life in anger,
Rashtrapal.
Thousands of people were
destroyed because of your anger!
Similarly
even you have to get
destroyed in your anger.
Rashtrapal!
It's time to head towards Magadh.
Chandragupta
I gave you a day's
time to surrender yourself!
It's already past now.
Now
your friend, Malayketu
will pay for your ego.
Malayketu, be prepared for your death!
Amatya.
Yes, Your Majesty.
Soldiers!
Get ready.
What happened, Amatya?
Your Majesty, the arrows are
not getting shot due to some reason.
Attack!
Perhaps
the arrows are blocked, Your Majesty.
So, that's where Chandra
would have used those magnets.
'This plan has anyway
turned successful.'
'Acharya, come soon.'
'It is time to carry
out our next plan.'
Dhananand!
Chanakya!
You had given one day's
time to Chandragupta to surrender.
Or else,
you were about to kill Malayketu.
Chandragupta did not surrender.
But yes, he has brought you a gift.
Will you not see it?
Do not get overexcited, Dhananand.
Because there is one
step left for your defeat.
Rashtrapal!
'The first pillar of Magadh Empire's
foundation has collapsed, Dhananand.'
'The remaining pillars
will collapse very soon.'
'Your downfall as well as
that of your courage has started.'
'Sukhasya Moolam Dharmah.'
'Dharmasya Moolam Arthah.'
'Arathasya Moolam Rajyah.'
'Rajyasya Moolam Indriya Jayah.'
'Indriyajayasya Moolam Vinayah.'
'Vinayasya Moolam Vruddhopasevah.'
'Vruddhopasevaya Vijnanam.'
'Vijnanena Atmaanam Sampadyet.'
'Samapaditatma Jitatmama Bhavati.'
'Jitatma Sarvarthe Sanyujyate.'
[Sanskrit shlok]
[Sanskrit shlok]
Acharya, I have always noticed
that whenever you get even
a little time you write
something in this book.
What is so important that
you write in this book, Acharya?
Just understand
that this is my most precious saving.
It is the essence of my life.
It is my legacy.
And I hope
that even after I leave this world
the knowledge put together
in this book will guide
many future generations.
Because I am fully confident
that even in the future
the information written
in this book will be as relevant
and important as it is today.
Shall I tell you something, Acharya?
You are an ocean of knowledge to me
and just a few drops of that
ocean have made my life blessed.
A wise and spiritual man
like you is putting everything
about himself in this book.
Then this is not a mere
book but a treasury of knowledge.
Anyone to get it will have
their entire lives blessed.
Not yet, Chandra.
Wait for some time.
You will soon find out
what is written in this book.
The time has come for
us to leave for Avanti.
Before Dhananand gets
over the death of his brother
we have to give him
another shock of his life.
'Do not be excited just yet,
Dhananand!'
'A stage of your defeat
is yet to happen.'
'The first pillar of Magadh
kingdom has fallen, Dhananand.'
'Soon, all the other
pillars will also fall.'
'The destruction of you
and your courage has begun.'
Chandragupta saved Malayketu
and defeated our beloved brother
Rashtrapal, at the same time.
He could not have planned this alone.
This is not possible
without a traitor.
I believe I know who the traitor is.
Who is it?
Tarini.
Durdhara, I can understand
what you are going through
and the thoughts you
might have right now.
Do you really want to know
what I am thinking of right now?
Come with me.
What are you doing, Durdhara!
You are mourning!
You are member of the royal family!
Neither can you apply the
colour on yourself or wear it.
What should I mourn for, Tarini?
For the death of a brother
who was worse than a demon?
Do you have any idea
how many innocents have lost their
lives because of my brother's rage?
Countless of them!
He once killed a servant
because the liquor served to him
was not cold.
No, Tarini..
I have been running away
from this truth until now.
I have been ignoring it.
It has taken me a
long time to accept it.
It took me a long time
to see the reality
of my family.
It took me a long time to find out
that my brothers are demons.
It is better to not have any family
than be member of such a family.
I am proud of you, Durdhara.
I have to admit this.
Chandragupta's future
wife is firm and posses
a bright character, just like him.
It is not easy to choose between
your family and what is right.
But you showed courage
and chose your motherland
over your family.
It is true that we exist
because our nation does.
Those against the nation
will find us against them.
Be it Rashtrapal or Dhananand.
I am ready.
Pardon me saying this.
We have received a bad
news from the Avanti Kingdom.
What is wrong now?
The king of Avanti has
rebelled our army in his region.
After capturing the deadly weapons
even the army of Avanti
has declared a war.
Wicked man!
The pyre of our brother
is still burning
and he has already
done something so bad.
Let us burn one more dead body
tomorrow along with King of Avanti.
It will be the son
of the king of Avanti
who is now in our captivity.
He cannot rebel us
for as long as we have his son.
That means..
'The matter seems strange here.'
'Yes, Dhananand. It is very strange.'
'You want to kill me'
'yet, none of them
have any fear for you.'
'Because they all know that someday'
'they will be free.'
One, two, three, four, five
six, seven, eight, nine, ten
eleven, twelve, thirteen, four..
The prince of Avanti is not here.
It looks like the unity
of Avanti's army and us
will beat Magadh's army even
before they enter the battlefield.
These strategic weapons
of the Rashtrapal
have turned out to be a boon for us.
Celebrating the victory
even before winning is not right.
In the battlefield, it is the war
which decides the final result.
We must bring down the
flag of Magadh from the palace
and unfurl the flag of Avanti.
We can celebrate
our victory after that.
War is like a hurricane.
We cannot guess what the
strong winds might bring with them.
Chandra, a big troop of
Magadh's army is approaching.
I will include every person
of our kingdom in the army
to ensure we are equal
to the number of their soldiers.
I will arrange soldiers
as much as I can.
It is important for us
to be equal to their strength
in order to win this war.
That is not needed, Rashtrapal.
It is the strategies which
win us the war and not numbers.
Our war strategy is
more efficient than theirs.
'You should hit the
water from your hand.'
'But ensure that not even a
drop of water comes out of this bowl.'
'Amazing!'
'Chandragupta, I wanted you to know'
'that the right use of energy'
'in the right amount'
'brings us success easily.'
Acharya means to say
that showing our army's
strength is not important.
We must just create a situation
which causes bigger impact.
But how do we attack
the army of Magadh?
By launching a perfect attack.
And for that,
we must trap the Magadh army.
The Sun which is situated so far
wipes out darkness here
and so does even a small lamp.
Sunflower blooms because of sun
so does a lotus under the moon.
That means,
just because the sun and moon are far
they do not hold less importance.
Similarly,
just because the lamp is close
it does not lose its value either.
And even in life
it does not matter who is close
and who is far from you.
Who inspires you is more important.
It is not the distance but
perspective which is important.
My ethics..
Your destiny.
Please forgive me, Your Highness.
Chandragupta has freed Avanti
with the help of the king of Avanti.

Episode: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IahMw1lVKlc

Get ready. Attack!
Our enemies have surrounded
us from all sides.
Chandragupta..
We have to run away from here.
- Right.
- Run!
Run away from here.
Run away from here.
Or else, I will kill all of you.
What is the matter, Chandragupta?
You do not look happy.
Because happiness is like
a victory celebration.
And it is the order from my mentor
that we must not celebrate
until we achieve complete victory.
King of Avanti, let us remove
the flag of Magadh
and hoist the flag
of Avanti once again.
That will be our complete victory.
Acharya,
he is not an ordinary student.
He is a gem of a person.
I know, Your Majesty.
That is great, Chandragupta.
Your strategy helped us
defeat our enemies.
You are wonderful.
Acharya, even though
I was fighting the war
but you are the one
to teach me all this.
I have done what you had taught me.
One out of 14 kingdoms is free.
It is the time to remove
the flag of Magadh
and put up the pride
and dignity of Avanti.
I know what you all must be thinking.
That I will not kill you all.
Because if I do so
then I will lose control
over your fathers.
I will not be able to humiliate them
and I will not be able
to rule the kingdoms.
By the way, all of you are right.
But it's important
that I have to kill you
just to torture you all.
I can torture you
by cutting your hands.
Soldiers.
I give you all
a last chance.
Anyone can volunteer
and tell me the truth
as to how the Prince of Avanti
escape rom here.
Who helped him?
Or else, none of you
will reach your father
but your chopped hands will.
Whoever wants to protect their hands
can raise their hands.
All right.
Get ready to lose your hand.
Wait, Your Majesty.
Let me understand the situation.
There must certainly be a solution.
If you torture them
then many kingdoms can go against you.
And we will not be able to fight them.
I am your brother.
I will never give you
any wrong suggestion.
Amatya, why not kill the person
who is taking care
of justice and rules.
My elder brother
Dashasidhika must have betrayed me
and must have released
prince of Avanti.
What are you saying?
All right. Let us assume
that you are not a traitor.
But you have made a mistake.
I had told you
to visit this place
at least five times a day.
So, tell me.
Did you come here even once?
No, right?
I will tell you what you
were doing yesterday.
You were dreaming about my wealth.
You were drunk.
You were jealous and thinking
that why do you
not have all that I have.
Am I right?
'Even I can become
a powerful king like Dhananand.'
'Why did Dhananand
get the wealth, respect'
'and the throne?'
'Even I am capable.'
'Then why?'
And you were so intoxicated
that you stole my precious razor.
Just to experience how it feels
to be the King of Magadh.
Amatya!
Why not start the process
- by killing him?
- No..
I am your brother. Your Majesty, stop.
I.. I am your..
Stop.
I know where Prince of Avanti is.
Give me one chance.
Prince of Avanti died
after you finished your food.
There was some reaction in his body.
And this is what happened to his body.
We tried to contact the guards
but none of them paid attention.
'Kids, do you remember what you
are supposed to tell Dhananand?'
'Do not worry.'
'Dhananand will never get to know'
'that Chandragupta has rescued
the prince of Avanti.'
There was no security breach,
Your Highness.
Otherwise,
I would have learned about this.
I can never betray you.
Chandragupta must have got the news
of the death of the prince of Avanti.
And he has instigated the king
of Avanti against you.
Chandragupta has used his death for
his own benefit, Your Highness.
Chandragupta, I know
that you are playing a game
with me for sure.
But one thing is clear.
I will not let you set
the sun of Magadh Empire.
Please take it, the king of Avanti.
It is the time to hoist
the flag of Avanti on the top
of the royal palace of Avanti.
I lost hope that I will witness
these spectacles in my life again.
One, seeing my son alive again.
And the second one
seeing the flag of Avanti
flying in Avanti.
The impossible has become possible
because of you, Chandragupta.
You have freed us from
Dhananand's dominance.
Hence, I have a request for you.
Henceforth, the flag of Piplivan
and Chandragupta Maurya
will be flying in Avanti.
No, the king of Avanti.
I will not hoist the flag
of my kingdom in your kingdom.
I did not free Avanti from
Dhananand's dominance
in order to establish my rule here.
I freed this kingdom
so that all of you
can breathe in free India
and live freely here.
I helped you in order to make
a treaty between us.
So that I find a new ally
who can help me
to achieve my dream of united India.
Our India will become united
when all the kingdoms
will stand by each other.
There will be no superior or inferior.
All the kingdoms will become united.
This is my dream.
And this is the dream
of Acharya as well.
The time will come
when there will be no border.
And then India will become united.
When I will make India united
then the flag of Maurya Empire
will be flying all over India.
Hence, I request you
to hoist the flag of Avanti
on the top of the royal palace of Avanti.
May the enemy be defeated.
Let my country be
united and victorious.
May the enemy be defeated.
Let my country be
united and victorious.
May the enemy be defeated.
Let my country be
united and victorious.
May the enemy be defeated.
Let my country be
united and victorious.
We have achieved our goal partially
by freeing one kingdom
among 14 kingdoms.
It is the time to achieve
our complete goal now.
Please forgive me, Your Highness.
Chandragupta has freed Avanti
with the help of the king of Avanti.
Hail Chandragupta Maurya!
Hail the king of Avanti!
Hail Chandragupta Maurya!
Hail the king of Avanti!
Hail Chandragupta Maurya!
Hail the king of Avanti!
Enough, Dhananand.
Stop all this.
What will you gain by doing all this?
Tarini, I am not doing this
to gain anything.
I am doing all this
so that I always remember this pain
because I will give more trouble
to Chandragupta
and that cunning Brahmin.
I will give them so much trouble
and so much pain
that they will prefer to go
into the arms of death
instead of staying alive.
Suffering yourself
to hurt somebody else is foolishness.
Step out of these embers.
I am Magadh
and Magadh does not take orders.
He give orders.
The combination of hatred and ambition
is a very dangerous poison.
This poison will destroy you
and your world one day.
I am telling you again. Stop.
Stop this stupidity.
Whatever you are calling poison
is actually elixir for me, Tarini.
I have become a powerful and strong king
only due to this ambition.
You are telling me that this ambition
will destroy me.
No, Tarini.
This ambition will destroy my enemies.
You will not agree like this.
What are you doing, Tara? Get down.
Step out these embers.
You will be injured otherwise.
I will not step out till you step out.
Tara, I said, step out.
I will not step out.
You will not agree like this, right?
'Why can you always see his problems?'
'Why can you sense his pain?'
'Why can you see his emotions'
'and not mine?'
'Why does this happen every time,
Tarini?'
Why did you hurt
yourself for me, Tarini?
There is a limit of being stupid.
Does anybody hurt oneself like this?
I had forgotten
that you only hate me.
You cannot tolerate me pouring water
on your wounds, right?
What happened?
Did I say something wrong
due to which you looked away?
I am sure
that you are very happy
after seeing Chandragupta defeating me
and humiliating me.
You are not understanding anything.
You are not understanding, Tarini.
The word defeat
is not present in my dictionary.
I am Magadh and everyone
bows down to me.
Look how I will capture that traitor
and bring him down on his knees.
A fist of rice is sufficient
to fill the stomachs
of the entire family.
But the rice needs to be soaked
in water for some time.
That is when it will come out
of its strong cover
and become soft.
That is not the end.
The rice has boil in hot wate
for some time too.
That is when it becomes
capable of eating.
We human beings
are also like this rice.
And the ones who leave
our safe environment
and step out
and face the heat of problems
and obstacles
aare the only ones who can
achieve their goal in life.
So, do not be scared of
problems and obstacles.
Keep trying continuously
and face them bravely.
Wait and watch then.
Success will be in your hands.
My ethics..
Your destiny.
I need to finish Chandragupta, myself.
Your Highness,
I present you a poison-maiden.
I know that you want to kill
your biggest enemy Chandragupta.
And I, Mansa, can fulfill your desire.

================================================================================

Episode: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IrLkpi9erKQ

My son is the future king
of a sovereign India!
He will never surrender
before that wretched Dhananand!
I am sure he will return
soon with Malay.
But we cannot wait
for him in this way.
The Magadh army is gaining
the upper hand in this battle.
I think we should surrender.
Or else, they might breach
our borders anytime.
And if they do that
many innocent lives will be lost.
If we surrender
then people of Paurav
Kingdom and Takshashila
will become slave to Dhananand.
No, we will not surrender.
I had promised Chandra that
I would fight till the last breath.
And I am sure that Chandra will return
before the army of Magadh
gets defeated.
Chandragupta!
Acharya Chanakya!
How is this possible!
The king of Avanti and his army
have allied with Chandragupta!
Commander, the armies
of Paurav nation, Takshashila
and Avanti have surrounded us
from all sides!
Now, we have no means left to escape!
Amatya
look at all these faces staring at me
laughing at me and mocking me.
They are belittling me!
Each of these faces
reminds me of my failure!
My defeat in the Paurav nation
and in Takshashila
and the fleeing of Malayketu
and me losing my reign
over the subjects of Avanti
and the defeat of my army
in the Paurav nation once again..
These shards of mirror
hurt my eyes, Amatya.
They pierce my heart.
Until I am alive
and breathing
I will let no harm come to you!
I have devised a ploy to hinder
Chandragupta's victory.
A ploy which he would
have never imagined.
Amatya..
Can you fulfill a task for me
before attacking Chandragupta?
Just order me, Your Majesty.
Join these shattered pieces
and make the mirror whole again.
But Your Majesty,
joining a shattered mirror is..
Impossible, is it not?
Yes, Your Majesty.
Similarly, it is impossible
for another person
to realise the pain that I am
enduring at the moment.
I need to finish Chandragupta, myself.
Because, now I do not trust
anyone else apart from myself.
But I very well know
how to win a man's trust.
Behold.
Who are you?
One who tantalises men's senses
relaxes his body
and fulfills everyone's wish.
Mansa..
Acharya..
Pardon my intrusion, Acharya.
But I just needed to inform you
that the armies of Takshashila
and Paurav kingdom
have secured our borders.
I do not feel that the Magadh army
would even dare to set foot here.
Excellent!
Well done, Chandragupta!
You lived up to the expectations
of both your mother and motherland.
All I pray for
is that our motherland is blessed
with many more sons like you.
Acharya, now you may carry on.
Wait.
This is your new friend.
Acharya, do you believe
that I am worthy of understanding
this sea of knowledge of yours?
Yes, Chandragupta.
The way you deftly freed Avanti from
the tyrannous rule of Dhananand
and after that,
exhibiting sheer courage
by making the enemy flee from here..
Seeing your calibre and being
your guru, I am overwhelmed.
So, being your guru
it is my duty to reward you.
As a reward, I would like to give you
this archive of knowledge.
Arthashastra?
Yes, Chandragupta.
This is not only a book
but also my most priceless possession.
Consider that,
whatever knowledge I departed with
that has been scripted
in this appendix.
All the experience
connected to politics..
Strategies of a battle..
The planning and dealing
connected to the army..
Monarchial autocracy..
Laws and taxes..
All these important
features of knowledge
have been penned by me in this book.
Chandragupta,
this is not a mere record
but it is the theme of my life..
This is my years contribution..
Contributions from
Vishnugupta Chanakya
called the 'Arthashastra'.
I have written this with a wish
that, even if I am not alive
I will indirectly be
serving my country with this book
and with the plethora of knowledge
I will benefit the future generations.
The time has come for you
to learn from this sea of knowledge.
Acharya, before reading this book
I would like to express
my gratitude to you.
Acharya, it is my good fortune
that you considered me
worthy of reading this book.
Please accept my gratitude, Acharya.
'Sukasya Mulam Dharma.'
This means, through duty
one gets happiness.'
'Wealth is churned out of duty.'
'The splendour of a kingdom
is gained from wealth.'
The progress of a kingdom
and keeping tab on everything
is only possible
when the progress and growth
is gained by helping the old
and the down trodden.
By helping the aged
the knowledge of truth is gained.
The knowledge of truth, that is..
Science.
With the help of science a king
should be made self-sufficient.
The king who recognises
his responsibilities
wins his senses.
And the person who controls his senses
gets all the assets easily.
Teacher, it is the same labyrinth
using which we freed Havanti
from subordination.
What is this?
The way waterfalls lead to canals
canals lead to rivers,
rivers lead to sea
and sea leads to ocean
the same way small
and big governance combine
and provide power
to a king at every level.
And they push him towards development.
That is why it is the prime
responsibility of a king
to distribute his workload
among the people under him
in a balanced way
and to make sure
that the his workers follow
the same principles
that he follows.
Teacher..
You are so good at economics.
You should share your knowledge
with the world.
No, Chandragupta.
I will not do any such thing.
And you will not do that either.
I know that you want to kill
your biggest enemy Chandragupta.
And I, Mansa, can fulfill
your desire.
You are just a weak woman.
Yes, you are beautiful, you are soft
but you are weak.
You cannot survive
even for a single moment
in front of Chandragupta and Chanakya.
The most deadly things
in the world are very beautiful.
Such as poisonous fruits
are the most beautiful ones.
Soldiers!
Now, this soft and weak woman
will show, what she can do.
Please forgive me, lady..
Please do not kill me.
I surrender.
Please do not kill me.
No.. I will not kill you.
You deserve a reward, not punishment.
You are a trained poison-maiden.
Great. Amatya, great!
I was sure
that you will never disappoint me.
Great!
Chandragupta, now I will take revenge
for every drop of poison
you mixed into my life
by giving you a poisonous death
at the hands of this
poison-maiden Mansa.
You mean to say
that you will not share
this knowledge of economics
with the world, Acharya?
But, Acharya, it is the duty of a Guru
to spread and advertise knowledge.
So, why do you want to keep
this knowledge from the world?
Chandragupta
bring that book here
and burn it in this fire.
- What?
- Yes, Chandragupta.
You heard me right.
Come forward and burn this book.
Acharya, what are you saying?
I will not burn such wonderful
and precious knowledge
at any cost.
Chandragupta
you are one of those who, despite having
immeasurable knowledge in one hand
would not wield the means
of destruction in the other hand.
- But..
- But Dhananand is not like that.
Yes.
Knowledge in wrong hands
can be very destructive.
We are at war right now.
And our enemy is a very cruel
cunning and complex man.
If he finds this knowledge
it could prove fatal for us.
You are right, Acharya.
For now, we should not
make this book public.
But, Acharya, promise me
that the moment you have
fulfilled your vow
the day we have dethroned Dhananand
then you will share
this knowledge of economics
with the world.
That day
the book 'Arthashastra'
will spread the light of knowledge.
Promise me, Acharya.
On the occasion of 'Guru Purnima'
I, Vishnugupta Chanakya, promise
that when you have become
the king of a united India
I will give this book
of economics to the world.
The relationship between
a teacher and student
is like that of a gardener
and a plant.
The gardener takes care of the plant.
He gives it water
and fertiliser to nurture it.
So that one day this small plant
can become a huge tree
and touch the skies.
The same way,
a teacher nurtures his student
with his knowledge.
He polishes his talent
and his virtues.
So that one day that student
can reach the height of his talent.
That is why, remember
if you want progress
and prosperity in life
then along with your
own hard work you should
also seek the blessings
and guidance of an able teacher.
My ethics..
Your destiny.
What is the next step of our plan?
Dhananand himself will kill
one of his brothers.
And the name of Dhananand's brother
whom we will use as
a weapon in this mission is..
Dashasidhika.

================================================================================

Episode: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2mqQykLP0U

Your Majesty..
You still are worried.
We have found a solution
to a problem called Chandragupta
in the form of Mansa,
the poisonous girl.
Right.
But the other problem
is still the same.
What is it?
The main reason behind my failure are
my brothers being lazy
and irresponsible.
All of them are so relaxed.
We have to find a solution, Amatya.
I had told Rashtrapal
to be more careful in
the weapon making centre.
But no..
He died because of them
and we also lost Avanti kingdom.
And my other brother, Dashasidhika..
We lost Prince of Avanti
because of his casual behaviour.
Although,
I do not believe that he is dead.
But still.. He is not with us.
Similarly, my third brother,
Kaivarth has lost control
over the army.
That is why, our army lost
to Paurav and Avanti kingdom.
Amatya, we have to do something
by which I can remind them
that I am the king of Magadh,
Dhananand
and I hate people who
are lazy and incapable.
I can understand your condition.
But you do not worry.
I have the solution to this problem.
His Majesty can only give pain.
But, I am ever ready to
apply ointment on your wound.
But you have always..
Dashasidhika,
your jealously is baseless.
Because I do not love Dhananand.
As far as you are concerned.
My answer is still the same.
His Majesty has asked
you all to summon in the court.
'Why has Dhananand asked
everyone to summon all of a sudden?'
'It must be his
inappropriate strategy.'
'But what?'
[sanskrit shlok]
[sanskrit shlok]
Greetings, Acharya.
Take your seat.
We are eager to begin the veneration.
[sanskrit shlok]
[sanskrit shlok]
All of you must be wondering
as to why did I tell you all
to summon all of a sudden.
Right?
Because it is 'Guru Purnima' today.
And a king is above every one.
Even above the teacher.
A teacher is above the king.
Because a king is worshiped
only in his kingdom.
But a teacher is worshiped
everywhere he steps.
Therefore,
I want to start the veneration
by washing the feet of my teacher.
Stul.
Brother Bhutapala..
You are the head of the informers
of all the states of Magadh.
It is your duty to ensure
that everything happens as it should.
I hope, you will not disappoint me.
And our enemies will not
get any information about Magadh.
Yes, Your majesty.
I will never disappoint you.
Just to remember your promise and duty
you have to drink this water.
What happened?
Is there any problem?
No, Your Majesty.
There is no problem.
If I find God and teacher on the way
then I would bow down
before the teacher first.
Because he is the one who
enlightens us about the God.
I am Magadh and Magadh is God.
So, it is your duty
to serve me. Right?
Brother Pandu.
Yes, Your Majesty.
May you be blessed with a long-life.
May you be glorious.
May you emerge victorious.
Why are you looking
at me like this, Acharya?
I am seeing that the seed
which I sowed many years ago
has grown into a strong
and huge tree now.
The boy whom I had seen playing
has changed into a strong
and brave young boy.
Acharya, whatever I am today
is all because of you.
Every breath of mine
is grateful of you.
Acharya, I will not stop
till I fulfill the dream of my guru
and till I form a united India.
Tell me, Acharya.
What is the next step of our plan?
In the next step of our plan
Dhananand himself will
kill one of his brothers.
Also, we will free the children
of all the district heads.
And the name of Dhananand's brother
whom we will use as a
weapon in this mission is..
Dashasidhika.
He is the head of the
law arrangement of the kingdom
and he is also the head
of the security arrangement
of the children of the district heads.
The guru worship is complete.
Now, it is time to
give a gift to the guru.
All of you must be wondering
why the king of Magadh,
Dhananand, wants any gift.
He has everything.
Your thinking is absolutely right.
I have everything
except for assurance.
Today, I want an
assurance from all of you
that you will honestly fulfil
all your duties.
So, on this auspicious occasion
of 'Guru Purnima'
all of you will take an oath.
Come on, let us begin
the oath taking ceremony.
We take an oath..
What happened?
Take the oath.
We take an oath..
No. Not like this.
Keep your hands on your hearts.
The same blood flows in our veins.
I think this bond has kept us together
due to which each other's lives
is very important to all of us.
Isn't it?
Take the oath then.
Keep your hands on your hearts.
We take an oath that
we will never disappoint
our brother who is like our guru.
And we will fulfill all the duties
and responsibilities
given by him honestly
and wholeheartedly.
Now, let us end the
oath taking ceremony
by breaking coconuts.
Coconut.
Sire it appears like a message.
'On the auspicious
occasion of 'Guru Purnima''
'accept the greetings of Chandragupta'
'the pupil of Acharya Chanakya.'
'I am sure that in the
ego of being the king of Magadh'
'you must have declared
yourself to be the ultimate guru'
'and forced your people
to bow down to you.'
'Had you understood the
right meaning of the word 'guru''
'Acharya Chanakya would
have been with you today.'
'It is because of his right direction'
'that I have freed the
Paurav and Avanti Kingdom'
'from the clutches of your rule'
'and have emerged
victories against you.'
'You are jealous of my victory,
are you not?'
'But this will only increase.'
'It will blind you'
'which will lead you towards
your self-destruction.'
'As far as you have this
feeling of jealously in you'
'I do not have to
try hard to destroy you.'
'Because it will kill you within,
slowly.'
'I have sent you this
message so that you can know'
'that we are celebrating
unity in the Paurav Kingdom.'
'And very soon, my perseverance'
'and the increasing unity of Bharat'
'will dethrone you.'
'Chandragupta!'
Our journey of unifying everyone
has now begun.
From today, Takshashila,
Paurav Kingdom and Avanti
are united.
We are now three times more powerful
and one third of
our problems are gone.
Our united power is
the trident of revolution.
Be it the storm of problems
or any other threat
the hope of United Bharat
will stand still.
We did not have control
over our destiny.
But it is surely
in our hands to decide
the destiny of our future generation.
Neither Takshashila and Paurav nor
Avanti has an individual existence now.
We now have only one existence
that is, Bharat.
United Bharat!
Long live Bharat!
Long live Bharat!
Long live Bharat!
Long live Bharat!
Long live Bharat!
Long live Bharat!
Long live Bharat!
Long live Bharat!
Long live Bharat!
Long live Bharat!
Wait for my signal.
Long live Bharat!
Long live Bharat!
On the land of our culture
and on the foundation
of our sacrifices
we will form a new
bright future of Bharat.
We will establish such a rule
which was a dream for the past
heaven for the present
and inspiration for the future.
Like how Malayketu is
the future of Paurav Kingdom
the prince of Avanti
is the future of Avanti Kingdom.
Similar to what we did to them
we will free the children
of all the kings of Bharat
from the clutches of Dhananand
And after that
we'll build an India
which will be self-sufficient,
independent and united.
'The prince of Avanti is alive?'
'I must inform this
to King Dhananand.'
This needle..
It looks very normal.
But with its little steps
it sets this cloth
free from its defect
and makes it useful again.
That is the quality
of an able ruler too.
With his minor perseverance
he washes off problems
from his society
and builds an environment
where his people can
live satisfied and peacefully.
Remember this.
Being an able king is not
just about people respecting you.
It is about him bettering the lives
with his perseverance and deeds.
My ethics..
Your destiny.
Tell me, Ambikumar.
Who is the one who attacked
my trusted person in my palace?
Tarini!

Episode: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Apd9E8glN8

We have had sorrows
and mourning until now.
But today we will
have a festival here.
A festival of unity!
Begin the festival of unity!
What happened, Prince of Avanti?
Why are you not participating
in the festival?
Why did you return?
Because I feel anguish
for my friends in the prison
who are still in that pain.
Their lives are still
under Dhananand's mercy.
Do you see that man?
- Do you know what he is thinking about?
- No.
He is trying to find
a solution for the problem
we are worried about.
Do not worry and rid
your mind of this burden.
You are here right now.
So take happiness in this moment.
Go on.
Just remember who you have to attack.
I will take care of everything else.
Go on.
Where are you going, Would-be King?
What do you mean?
What I meant
is that a culture does
not contain only the armies.
Art is also integral
part of a culture.
We have witnessed your
ability to lead an army.
But are you not going to put
on a display of your dancing skill?
Never! You are a fool, Stulbhadra.
And what if it is my order?
Mother, you know I
cannot refuse your orders.
And that is the very reason I asked
Her Majesty Mura to give you an order.
Oh! So you all are involved in this.
You just told us about
unity and its advantages.
All right!
It is going to be amazing now!
I acknowledge your skill!
'Every arrow aimed by
you is hitting its mark.'
'I hope you are successful
soon and we will then'
'consummate our love with a marriage.'
'And be united forever.'
'No one will then
be able to separate us.'
'And then we will not have the fear'
'of losing each other.'
'Your annoying princess..'
After seeing my message that day
Amatya has kept the
stud under close watch.
What?
I thought you have
handled everything here.
I did.
But you know how Amatya is.
He will keep suspecting
me for as long he is satisfied.
He has kept a close watch
on the birds who deliver messages.
It is not safe for you to go there.
And we should not contact
Chandragupta in any way
after the incident of Malay's escape.
Trust me, Durdhara.
I know what it is to
stay away from your love
and not being able to talk to him.
But I do not find this bad, Tarini.
Because this is for the
sake of Chandra's safety.
The royal physician
has sent a message.
Inform the king immediately
that Prince Ambikumar
is regaining his consciousness.
If Ambikumar regains his consciousness
he will inform everything
about us to the king.
He will tell him how
we all teamed up with Chandra
and tried to rescue
Malay and the other princes.
If this happens,
all our plans will fail.
I am surprised!
I did not know that
my dear sister, Durdhara
cares for Ambikumar so much
that she came to his room
to enquire about his health.
And, Tara
I did know that you
are so close to each other
that you are together.
But this is obvious.
After all, there is one
similarity between you both.
It is your hatred towards me.
Come, let us get into the room
and find out what
important information
Ambikumar wants to give me.
Prince of Avanti!
She has got a deep wound.
Who are you?
Take her inside immediately.
Everyone in Magadha knows
how important you are for me.
An attack on you
means an attack on me.
Tell me, Ambikumar.
Who is the one who attacked
my trusted person in my palace?
Tell us, Ambikumar.
Who is the king's enemy
who did this to you?
Answer us.
Tarini!
Do not cross your limits, Ambikumar.
I am sorry, Your Majesty.
Give him one chance
to make himself clear
because he knows very well
that if his words are proved wrong
you will not keep him alive.
Tell me, what had happened
with you that night
when you were attacked?
That night, Tarini..
Tarini..
That night.. What is happening?
Why am I not able recollect anything?
Why am I not able recollect anything?
What is happening to me?
'Where is Ambikumar? Look for him.'
'Tarini.'
Tell me, Ambikumar.
I am waiting for your answer.
What did you see?
I.. I saw that Tarini..
Tarini is a queen.
No, Tarini is a warrior.
She had a sword. Sword.
Flower. Flower vase.
Vase.. She hits with a vase.
Tarini has big hands. Her face is red.
She has many powers. She is a demon.
She is a murderer.
Your Majesty, she will kill you.
She is your enemy.
She will finish you, Your Majesty.
What nonsense are you talking?
This is not nonsense.
Tarini is cunning.
She is a demon. She is an attacker.
Your Majesty,
she does not know about this.
But I, Ambikumar, will protect you.
I will not let you
get a single scratch.
Your Majesty. Your Majesty, trust me.
You are not safe in this palace.
Nobody is safe, Your Majesty.
All of us will die, Your Majesty.
Tarini is cunning. She is a demon.
She is a murderer, Your Majesty.
In this palace, Amatya is not safe.
Durdhara is not safe.
I will protect everyone, Your Majesty.
Tarini is cunning. She is a demon.
How is your health now?
I am absolutely fine now.
Thank you very much.
I should be thanking you.
You saved my son.
Accept this small gift.
No, Your Majesty.
How can I accept a gift for my duty?
Besides, not your son,
but you were his target.
What!
Yes. I heard somebody
in the crowd saying
that King Dhananand wants
to get the king of Avanti killed
at any cost.
I will always be
grateful to you, Lady.
Looking at the danger
on you and the prince of Avanti
I think both of you
should stay with us
for few days in Paurav Kingdom
so that we can ensure your safety.
You are right.
Which is your village?
Our soldiers will
drop you there safely.
I am from Bhandi village.
I have lost everything.
I have been taking shelter
here from many days.
I want to join your army.
And I would feel lucky.
I know that I am
not a skilled warrior.
But when necessary
I can risk my life too for you guys.
Every help is welcome for us.
But you get better first.
We will see after
that how you can help us.
Come, Chandragupta.
I hope you have understood
why I allowed her to stay here.
I remember your strategy, Acharya.
Keep your friend close
and keep your enemy more closer.
You are right.
Based on the current scenario
any stranger can be a friend
or an enemy.
She can be Dhananand's spy too.
Keep an eye on her.
'Dhananand, no plan of yours'
'can stop our India from uniting now.'
Have you ever seen an ant
carrying its food to its house?
No matter how many obstacles
and hindrances it faces
but it succeeds slowly
in reaching its goal.
The conclusion is
most of our problems in life too
are mental and not physical.
But we..
We accept defeat in
front of the situations.
But if we also decide like the ant
that no matter how
many obstacles we face
we won't accept defeat
in front of them.
Our mental weakness
will keep decreasing slowly
and we can overcome
the biggest problems.
Remember one thing.
Our negative thinking
is the biggest barrier
that prevents us
from reaching our goal.
The principles are mine
and the destiny is yours.
Poison of one drop
of blood of poison-maiden
is equivalent to poison of 100 snakes.

================================================================================

Episode: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tv7kU8BAo6M

Tara, I know..
I know that no matter
how much you hate me
you cannot bear to see me in pain.
And I cannot hurt you.
But..
I can hurt myself.
So, tell me.
Why have you come back to Magadh?
I had told you that
my mother is unwell.
I had come to meet her.
Is this the only reason
or you have some connection
with Chandragupta and Chanakya?
Answer me, Tara.
If you do not trust me
then why do you want
me to be in this palace?
Anyway, I do not wish to stay here.
I want to know the truth.
I am asking you for
the last time, Tara.
Do you have any connection
with Chanakya and Chandragupta?
Yes, I have.
I share a connection
with Chandragupta.
Years ago,
when you had destroyed his house
I was present there.
I was in the same forest, Dhananand.
And I had protected many people
from your soldiers.
But, I did not know when your greed
for authority and power
would come to an end.
Hence, I started everything
afresh in that forest.
I kept running away from you.
But, Chandragupta has the courage
which I did not.
I beg your pardon, Your Majesty.
But your presence is mandatory
to discuss an important topic.
I hope, you would have got
the answer to your question.
I think, this is too soon
to introduce the Prince of Avanti
to the rest of the world.
After today's incident Dhananand will
get to know that he is alive and..
This is what I wanted.
Dhananand should
learn at the right time
that the Prince of Avanti is alive.
Yes, Mother.
This was Acharya's strategy.
So that, we can rescue
the other royal kids.
That means, I was right.
Prince of Avanti is alive.
That means, a game
is being played, Amatya.
He is not dead.
He escaped!
And then a dead body was planted
in order to hide the truth.
And then those children
were asked to tell a story
which would prove
that the kid was dead.
'Prince of Avanti
died after the dinner.'
Amatya, are you able
to understand the entire game?
Yes, I do.
There could be two possibilities.
Your brother betrayed you
and helped Chandragupta
in freeing Prince of Avanti.
Or he tried to cover up
his mistake and the loophole
in the security management
by plotting the fake
death of the Prince of Avanti.
You shall learn the truth very soon,
Your Majesty.
I am presenting your brother,
Dashasidhika before you.
No.
No, Amatya.
I have a better idea.
Send all the boys
to Dashasidhika.
What are you up to, Your Majesty?
How can you take such a risk?
Because all of us know
that he is not capable
to take up such a huge responsibility.
Amatya, if you want
to refrain the thief
from stealing, then you must
appoint the thief as your guard.
When all the boys will
be at Dashasidhika's palace
he will think several
times before doing anything.
Because any mistake or betrayal
can lead to my brother's death.
When Dhananand decides
to relocate the boys
we shall rescue them.
And we can put all the blame
on Dhananand's brother, Dashasidhika.
And then, out of anger
the king of Magadh,
Dhananand, himself
will kill his brother, Dashasidhika.
I have decided that none of you
will stay in this jail anymore.
Each one of you is the future
king of your respective empires.
So, all of you should live in luxury.
That's why, there's no need
to live in this miserable place,
anymore.
What are you waiting for? Come out.
Come out!
Your Majesty
as per your orders,
till the arrangements are made
for their stay in Dashasidhika's
palace they will stay in your room.
It has to be under tight security.
No one should get an
inkling what I'm going to do.
Definitely, Your Majesty.
There is one more problem Amatya.
What is it?
I still cannot hear
the sound of my victory
which means Mansa has not succeeded
with her intention
to kill Chandragupta.
Do not worry, Your Majesty.
Mansa has not failed
in any of her tasks ever.
And I am sure that
just one attack from her
will destroy the enemy forever.
That will be better for her, Amatya.
Because if she fails to do this
she knows very well
what can happen to her.
Yes, Your Majesty.
It's doesn't taste good.
It lacks something.
Make this meal as
delicious as you want.
But this meal
will be the last meal for all of you.
'I must come up with something'
'to send all of them away from here.'
Now, it tastes great.
Now, this pudding
is ready to be served.
But, there is hardly
any pudding left here.
What I meant is prepare pudding
which matches the taste of this.
And then serve it.
Snake! Snake!
Go and get a stick.
Poison of one drop
of blood of poison-maiden
is equivalent to poison of 100 snakes.
You cannot save
yourself from this venom
Chandragupta!
'Chandra,
I am unable to send you a message'
'because of tight
security in the palace.'
I hope that you are safe, Chandra.
Mansa, have your medicines
before eating your food.
Shall we start eating?
Chandra, are you all right?
'I made your wish come true,
Emperor Dhananand.'
'This is the end of Chandragupta'
'the future emperor
of undivided India.'
Chandra, what happened?
Why did you start coughing
while having food?
This food is not that bad.
I personally had tasted
each and every dish.
Chandra.
No problem.
You will be fine if you
take a couple of sips of water.
'No, Mura.'
'No one can save Chandragupta now.'
I am grateful, Mother.
Mansa, what's wrong with you?
Mansa!
Someone do something.
Mansa!
Go. Go and get the royal physician.
Wait, Stulbhadra.
No need to get the royal physician.
Acharya.. There's no need.. But why?
A person bitten by a venomous
being should get medical help.
The venomous being does
not require any such help.
I mean, she is a 'Vishkanya'.
Dhananand sent her to kill all of us.
But, Acharya.. How can you be so sure?
Guard!
Your Majesty,
this is the arrow which struck Mansa.
Her blood was on
the tip of this arrow.
I noticed this and I saw
that the tip of this
arrow was getting eroded
when it came in
contact with her blood.
It was natural for me
to get suspicious.
And then, I examined her blood.
After the examination, I learnt
that her blood contained
high levels of venom.
Whatever doubts I was left with
were cleared by her today.
I saw her putting her venomous blood
in the food, today.
That means..
She had put the snake
outside the kitchen
so that we get distracted and in
the meantime, she poisoned the food.
Yes. But you do not have to worry.
I got rid of the
poisoned food, earlier
so that we can be safe.
But Mansa was not aware of this.
And the medicine she
consumed before the meal
is the reason why
the venom in her body
is showing adverse effects.
She will die very soon.
Acharya! We need to save her.
No matter what,
we invited her to our palace.
She is under our shelter.
Those who seek your shelter
you must protect them.
This is not how a guest
should be treated, Acharya.
She is not a guest, Chandragupta.
She is an assassin
who had come here to kill all of us.
Acharya, it does not matter.
Please save her now.
I beg of you. Please save her.
And then, I will expel her from here.
But please save her now.
Here, drink this.
Mansa, the person whom you
tried to kill has saved your life.
Now, you have to choose
whether you'll support Dhananand
or Chandragupta.
A small piece of coal
is significant to different
people in different ways.
It is a means to melt
the iron for an ironsmith.
For an artist
it is a means of sketching a picture.
For a person who works at a coal mine
it's a means of his livelihood.
In all the situations,
the coal is the same
but the difference is among the
perspectives of the people who use it.
And different perspectives
are very important
in solving various problems.
Just remember a narrow
mindset and a bad perspective
can worsen the problems
instead of solving them.
My ethics..
Your destiny.
Luck is not going to be
in our favour for long.
Ambikumar will recover very soon.
And Dashasiddhika..
Is that a message
from Chandragupta?
Yes.
So, we can get rid of both Ambikumar
and Dashasiddhika
with just one move.

================================================================================

Episode: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ycgnavd21s

'Tell me, Ambikumar.'
'Who is His Majesty's enemy
who reduced you to this condition?
'Tarini.'
Please try to understand my point.
His Majesty had instructed
me to inform him about
Ambikumar's health
early in the morning.
So, let me go into his chamber.
Physician, His Majesty
has ordered not to let anyone
into his chamber until
he comes out on his own.
Dhananand has not stepped
out of his chamber since yesterday.
What new plan is he hatching?
All the security arrangements have been
completed in my palace, Your Majesty.
I am ready to take these children
to the safest prison in my palace.
Remember.
These children are
a great tool to keep
the throne and power in my control.
Through them, I will be able to rule
over the 13 kingdoms unhesitatingly.
Their safety is of
utmost importance to me.
Certainly, Your Majesty.
I will get your chariot ready.
It is very important
for me to meet His Majesty.
I think there is something else
that I need to focus on at present.
Pardon me, Your Majesty.
But I am here to inform
you that Ambikumar's health
is better than before.
We can see the effect
of our treatment.
So, is he in a condition to speak now?
He will completely
recover within a few hours.
Only after that will he
be able to answer your questions.
Good.
Very good!
Before it is too late, I need to
solve this problem called Ambikumar.
Chandra, here is the message
that you want to give to Tarini.
Acharya.
Are you able to see whatever I see?
Yes, Stulbhadra seems
to be somewhat sad.
Yes, Acharya.
He has been sad ever
since we have expelled Mansa
the beautiful poison
girl from our kingdom.
I feel, Stulbhadra is feeling
lonely after Mansa's departure.
Right, Stulbhadra? Am I not right?
Yes, Chandra.
Ridicule me like you always do.
But today,
I am not just sad, I am also worried
as to how you could
commit such a big blunder.
She is a poison girl.
She could have proved to be
very useful in achieving our goal.
But you sent her away.
If you did not want
to appoint her in our army
then why did you save her?
We are not including just any murderer
or warrior in our army.
In order to be absorbed into our army,
one particular quality
is very important in every soldier.
That is, complete belief
and loyalty towards the mission
of 'United India'.
The one who is committed
to this objective is eligible
to be included in our army.
I am in complete agreement
with his logic, Stulbhadra.
He has taken the right decision
by not including Mansa in our army.
Loyalty develops in
the depth of one's soul.
It cannot be developed
by force or wealth.
Let us go, Chandragupta.
You are right.
Loyalty cannot be bought by wealth.
This pouch was given
to me by Dhananand
to kill Chandragupta
as well as you all.
I am a poison girl.
And being a poison girl,
killing people for money is my job.
But Chandragupta made me realise
that money is not
everything in this world.
The most precious thing is respect.
And despite knowing that
I am here with the intention
of killing him, he spared my life.
This act clearly showed
me the difference between
Chandragupta and Dhananand.
'Do you know, Mansa?'
'You and the rose are similar'
'in appearance and beauty.'
'Your skin is as soft'
'as this rose petal.'
'Now watch what I am going to do.'
'If you fail to kill Chandragupta'
'even your beautiful face'
'will be like this rose.'
I know you do not have a
reason to trust me, Chandragupta.
But if you give me a chance
I can help you with your motive.
Give me a chance to prove my loyalty.
Fine. If you want
to prove your loyalty
take this. Go to the Magadh's palace
and give my message
to Tarini or Durdhara.
But be careful.
She is under tight security.
Since you want to prove
your loyalty by your actions
bring Durdhara or Tarini's belonging
as a confirmation that
the message was delivered
so that I can be relieved
that they have received my message.
All right?
Fine. I will see you soon.
Once Durdhara or Tarini
will receive my message
Dashasiddhika and Ambikumar's
destruction will begin together.
'I should approach Durdhara
at the earliest and find a solution'
'to this problem raised
because of Ambikumar.'
Some things never change.
You are still as beautiful
as you were years ago.
Some people don't change either.
You are right.
My feelings for you
are still the same.
You anyway hate Dhananand, now.
Then, why don't you come to me?
If you hate me and
every person in this palace
what are you doing over here?
- What do you have to do with it?
- I am not satisfied with your answer.
Please explain.
Fine.
I am here because
I still love Dhananand.
And I will continue loving him
till my last breath.
Thank you very much for bringing
Chandragupta's message to me.
Take this.
This is a confirmation
that Chandragupta has asked for.
Seeing this, will confirm
that I have received his message.
Who is it?
Tarini!
Do not be so relaxed.
Luck is not going to
be in our favour for long.
Ambikumar will recover very soon.
And Dashasiddhika..
Is that a message from Chandragupta?
Yes.
Perhaps, he has suggested
some solution through this.
So, we can get rid of both Ambikumar
and Dashasiddhika with just one move.
But we have to do it soon.
I think Dhananand is
going out of the palace.
And as per our plan
Dhananand will have to witness
Ambikumar's destruction.
Your Majesty!
When you know you have to take these boys
to your palace, what took you so long?
Your Majesty,
I was getting your chariot ready.
No! No.
I am not happy with your answer.
Perhaps, you have a
secret lover in this palace
and you went to bid farewell to her.
No, Your Majesty. I was..
Now, when it comes to
these kids you need not..
- Amatya!
- Yes, Your Majesty.
On the other end of this tunnel
I shall meet you with my army, Amatya.
Your orders shall be followed.
Soldiers, escort them.
Soldiers!
Soldiers, save me!
It feels good to see
that you have recovered this soon,
Ambikumar.
But it's unfortunate
that Dhananand didn't
believe whatever you said.
By the way, you were right.
I am not what Dhananand thinks I am.
But now, nobody will believe you.
As right now
you are just a delusional
and an unhealthy man
who doesn't even know
what he is talking about.
I didn't know that
the concoction given by me
would make you a laughing stock.
Do you feel angry?
Do you want to kill me?
Take this.
Kill me.
Save your king.
I know that you are
King Dhananand's enemy.
And I shall not spare you.
Your Majesty!
Your Majesty!
Your Majesty!
Durdhara!
Your Majesty!
Where is the emperor?
I must find him.
He is busy with an important task.
Tell me. What is the matter?
- That.. Tarini!
- What happened?
Her life is in danger.
- Take me to her.
- Let us proceed.
What are you doing Ambikumar?
I am innocent.
Ambikumar..
Don't get trapped in his talks.
He is a traitor.
I will have to kill her.
Your Majesty,
you must come with me urgently.
I will take her to the king
and there she will be forced
to speak the truth as to who she is
and then I will kill her
in front of the king.
You are making a grave mistake.
Let go of me.
How dare you attack Tarini!
Forget about killing her
I won't even let you touch her.
Here is the price that
you wanted me to pay.
I am sure that I
have proved my loyalty
towards you and your goal.
This bangle belongs to Durdhara.
It means, Tarini and Durdhara
have received my message.
Which also means
that Ambikumar must be dead by now.
Your Majesty,
Ambikumar attacked Tarini
so I had to kill him.
Ambikumar injured you!
Ask the royal physician
to get the medicine ready.
I shall personally escort
you to him for the treatment.
That is not required.
I can take care of myself.
Stop me, if you can.
Mansa, how is Durdhara?
Is she all right?
Did she send a message for me?
Princess Durdhara is absolutely fine.
Princess Durdhara and
Tarini couldn't talk much to me
but there's some
information from the palace.
The information is
that since last night
Dhananand has locked
himself in his chamber
and no one has any idea
what is he up to.
Only Amatya and Dashasiddhika
are allowed to enter his chamber.
When it comes to Dhananand
he has always been very secretive.
But the fact that he has
locked himself in his chamber
makes me feel suspicious.
Of course.
Surely, he is hiding something.
Or he is trying to protect someone.
As in the entire Magadh
there is no place
safer than his chamber.
Acharya, what is this precious thing
which Dhananand is keeping
in his chamber secretly
and trying to protect from everyone?
His empire!
It means
in his chamber he is trying to hide
the 13 princes of 13 kingdoms.
When he got to know that
the Prince of Avanti is alive
he kept the other
princes in his chamber
before dislocating them.
Yes.
And Dashasiddhika's presence
is confirming my suspicion.
Dhananand will be sending those boys
to the prison located
in Dashasiddhika's palace.
Acharya, I think we need
to go there without any delay.
Yes.
Acharya, there's only one way
to breach the security
and reach those kids.
Dashasiddhika must
escort me to the prison.
You are right.
When you carry out this task
I shall keep Amatya,
Dhananand and his bothers busy.
Acharya!
To bring them together at one spot
and to deceive them will not be easy.
How will you do all this?
Chandragupta, can you see the sun?
When its light is at its peak
it can meddle with
one's vision for a while.
One doesn't become blind
but one feels so.
I shall create such an
illusion for Dhananand and others
that will keep them
all busy for a while.
You must take advantage
of the situation
and rescue those kids.
Sure, Acharya.
This picture is
beautiful in its own way.
Isn't it?
But if I add some colours
to this colourless picture
then it will look even more beautiful.
Similarly, in our life
if we add the colours
of hard work and dedication
if we help our dear ones
or if we do something
for the welfare of society
then definitely
we and the people around us
can bring a positive
change for the betterment.
My ethics..
Your destiny.
Chandragupta, I have already
told you about this riddle.
But before I put forth this riddle
in front of Dhananand.
I want to know if you
can solve this riddle.
So, tell me what is
this answer to this riddle?

================================================================================

Episode: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZvfE8aJozFs

I see only one way to breach
Dhananand's security
cover and reach the children.
That Dashasiddhika herself
takes me to the prison.
While you do that,
I take the responsibility
of engaging Dhananand,
his minister and other brothers.
How will you do this?
I can see everything
but I can't see the blood
oozing from your wounds.
I can't see your pain, Tara.
I know that you are brave.
You are everything.
If you ever had or have
any feeling for me in your heart
then remain here.
Excuse me, King.
But I have come to remind you
that we have an important
task to complete.
Let's go.
Brother Dashasiddhika,
you shouldn't have done this.
Do you mean I shouldn't
have murdered Ambikumar?
He had attacked on Tarni.
No..
No..
I am not angry because
you killed Ambikumar.
He deserved it.
But I am angry
because you gave
him such an easy death.
Forget about touching Tara
even if anyone eyes her
with a bad intention then
I will personally give him such a slow
and painful death
that he will sense every drop of blood
that he loses.
He will suffer until
his last breath.
For once, I forgive you
for giving him a quick death.
By next time
don't disappoint me.
Yes, King.
Move.
In my entire life,
I never found a person
who could solve the riddle
of the lion in the cage.
But I don't know why you
are paying me such a hefty sum?
Because the future of
Bharat depends on this riddle?
My friend, I once again thank you.
Chandragupta, before I
present this riddle to Dhananand
I want to know if you
can solve this riddle.
Acharya, do you want to test me?
Why not?
The future emperor of entire Bharat
must be ready for any
situation at any time.
So, tell me what is
this answer to this riddle?
The solution to this riddle is..
Excellent.
It will be soon proven
to the whole world
that Chandragupta is ready
to save Bharat from getting divided.
I have myself inspected
the security arrangement.
These kids cannot go
out without a traitor's help.
Minister,
post some of my soldiers here
because I can't trust
Brother Dashasiddhika
for the kids' safety.
I am sure that Dashasiddhika
will definitely succeed.
Don't worry.
Don't tell me not to worry'.
On hearing this,
I start to worry more.
The last time you said that Mansa
has gone to kill my enemies.
Did our enemies die?
They didn't.
She was about to
succeed in her mission
but the clever Chanakya
foiled her plan.
The good news we have
is that she is still at it.
She is chasing her mark.
She can succeed any time.
Forgive me for intruding, my Lord.
A trader has come
and he seeks your permission
to enter Pataliputra.
He has brought a puzzle with him
as a lion in a cage.
Brother Dashasiddhika!
Do you see this time
is fit to solve riddles?
This..
How dare you even suggest
such a thing to me?
My Lord
I think we must let him enter.
Since he carries a riddle.
- What do you mean?
- I mean to say
that there is a prophecy
bound to the riddle.
What prophecy, Councilor?
Hear ye! Hear ye! Hear ye!
Listen to me what we have to say!
Hear ye! Hear ye! Hear ye!
Listen to me.
The one who solves this riddle
shall be the true ruler
of the Land of Bharat!
Councilor.
What do you think of this riddle?
This riddle does
carry some truth to it.
No one has solved it for centuries.
Fate wills that trader
to come to our kingdom.
Then let him in, Councilor.
And let my subjects be invited
to the grand arena!
Gather my subjects!
So they all shall witness
that divine moment.
As I solve that riddle!
And thus by fulfilling
the great prophecy
I, Dhananand, shall be
the ruler of the land of Bharat!
The great Emperor Dhananand!
Hear ye! Hear ye! Hear ye!
Listen to me what we have to say!
Chandragupta, it is time for you
to play your part.
- Go now.
- Yes, Master.
Listen to me. Where is the arena?
Over there.
Over there! Come forth!
Hear ye! Hear ye!
People of Magadh!
You all know that there
is no one greater than me
in this entire landmass!
And today you shall witness
yet another sign
of my greatness.
Merchant, come forth!
Step aside! Move aside!
Greetings.
Trader.
Show us all the riddle.
As you command, great Lord.
So tell us, Trader.
What is this riddle?
Hear ye! Hear ye!
Hear me, all the people gathered here!
This riddle is most simple
and if seen from another perspective
it will appear as a maze.
Heed me well what one must do!
One must free this lion by wits
and not by brute strength.
Without opening the cage!
One who can do that..
That man shall be the ruler of Bharat!
- Is that right?
- Truly said, Sire!
Sire, before you attempt
to solve this.
I have a request.
I wish to present an
offering to Princess Durdhara
if you would allow me.
As I know that the joy of the Emperor
lies in the joy of the princess.
You are right, trader.
The reason for my
happiness has always been..
My sister.
Hence beware!
My sister should like your gift.
She will surely like it.
Hey, soldier, please come here.
Go.
'Take this, this is the thing
that Chandragupta asked me for.'
'Acharya and Chandragupta
have come here.'
'It means they are going
to free the other children.'
'Check the security of your palace,
Dashasiddhika.'
'I am coming to free all
those children. Chandragupta.'
Soldiers, come with me.
'I will wait for
you at the north side.'
Trader, I think my sister
did not like your gift.
I also want to see what is the gift.
No..
I like the gift given by him.
Thank you for the gift.
I hope your wish is granted today.
Trader, let's move
ahead to the riddle.
I am very impatient to
show my subjects my greatness.
Emperor
I have heard that the joy of victory
increases even more
when many people fail
in the attempt before us.
I don't have any doubt
that you will solve this riddle.
But don't you want to show the world
how difficult it is
to solve this riddle.
It is not so easy.
Emperor
I think before you start
you should give some other people
the opportunity to solve this riddle.
By other people I mean, like..
Like your brother.
Amazing! Very nice!
I like this thought
of yours very much.
I should surely call my brothers.
'Now it is not very
long before Chandragupta'
'will free the 13 princes
of the 13 kingdoms'
'and the dream of 'United
India' will be fulfilled.'
Have you ever paid attention to this?
When the King of
the jungle goes around
he is either alone or
in a group with other lions.
He never mixes about
with the other animals.
And this is because
the company you keep is important
in developing your personality.
If you keep the company of people
whose thoughts are high and good
you will also go to
the height of success.
But if you stay with
people with bad thoughts
they will push you
towards destruction.
Remember, your company decides
the speed of your future.
My ethics..
Your destiny.
Everyone listen to me carefully.
All of you make a human ladder
and reach the ventilator.
I will help you come out from there.
What are you doing?
Chandragupta!

================================================================================

Episode: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJ4yyEsumMg

Amatya, call my brothers here quickly
so that my people can also see
that only I have the
capability and talent
to sit on the throne of Magadh.
Not my brothers.
Because my brothers will not be able
to solve this riddle.
And my domination over my people
will increase even more.
As you say, Your Majesty.
If you have any doubt of enemy
infiltrating then inform me.
Understood.
King Dhananad has called
you in the play area.
'That means Acharya's plan has begun.'
Brothers, there is a problem.
Chandragupta!
The guru's veneration first.
And this riddle now.
King Dhananand does not leave
any opportunity to humiliate us.
To save ourselves
from this humiliation
we should reject
this proposal together.
Be careful, Brother.
Going against Dhananand may prove
to be dangerous for you.
Brother Pandu.
You are the eldest
among all the brothers.
So, you should get the first chance
to solve this riddle.
But remember one thing.
You will get only one chance.
Yes, Your Majesty.
Get ready to be humiliated.
Humiliation is better than death.
He is using his strength
before his mind.
Amatya, I do not know why I feel
that the speed with
which my brother went
he will return with the same speed.
This strength is not sufficient.
This is the most powerful
metal in the world.
You will have to
use more strength. Yes.
Brother Pandu.
Brother Pandu,
you should be grateful to me
that I have spared you from the pain
of claiming your right
over the throne of Magadh.
If you would claim
your right over the throne
you would lose your
respect just like this.
Come.
Let my other brothers also try.
Amatya, everything
is going on according to our plan.
Today, everyone will get to know
that I alone am capable
of becoming the great king.
Nobody else!
Emperor Dhananand!
Unfortunately, Dashasidhika has
kept the keys of this jail with him.
But you all do not worry.
I will find out a way
to help you release from here.
But the gates of this
jail are made of iron.
If we try to break them
then guards will get alert.
We need not break them.
Look there.
Everyone listen to me carefully.
All of you make a human ladder
and reach the ventilator.
I will help you come out from there.
Hurry up.
Come out.
What sound is this?
The guards come to check
this place every now and then.
This is the sound
of the same inspection.
What are you doing?
All of you continue your efforts.
I will handle all of them.
Oh, ho!
Your hand is bleeding.
It must be hurting.
Come on, get your hand treated
my delicate brother, Kairivrath.
Go.
Take a look, Tara.
It seems my brother Dashasidhika
has conceded defeat
even before trying.
Brother Dashasidhika
please wait for a moment.
As you were unsuccessful in protecting
my prisoners were alive
then, how will you be able
to take out that lifeless statue.
Just think of it.
Take my advice..
Do not even try.
You will not be able to do it.
Or else, the people will think
the prison in charge
does not know anything.
Whatever self-respect left in you
will also shatter.
Your Highness!
It seems that your turn has come.
You have to solve this riddle.
Of course!
I will solve this riddle.
What happened, Durdhara?
Would you not like to see your brother
solving this unparalleled riddle?
I am bored in seeing
your effort in proving
that you are the mighty emperor.
All the results are alike.
So, you accept
that I will solve this riddle.
As I said, I am bored with this.
I have no interest
in watching your feat.
I am going.
'Chandragupta, I hope you have freed'
'all the children from the dungeon.'
Everybody, come with me quickly.
Hide there.
Quickly! Hide there!
Listen! Listen! Hurry up!
Chandragupta.. He is here!
He broke open the prison.
What are you doing here, then?
Why did not you stop him?
Alone? He is Chandragupta!
He has the strength of ten elephants.
I will not go alone. Come with me.
Hurry up!
Come quickly from here.
Come. Hurry up.
What happened?
You would've broken
the door to the dungeon
if you had the strength
of ten elephants.
I only praised myself.
Nobody gets a chance like this.
Listen carefully.
We need to head towards the north.
My friend Stulbhadra
is waiting for us there.
'I hope Stulbhadra
has already reached there.'
People of Magadh!
All of you saw that my brothers tried
their best to break those bars open.
But all of them were unsuccessful.
So, I, King Dhananand
will show everybody
how this riddle
is solved.
Yes. Emperor, along with the subjects
even I am excited to see
how will your apt mind
will solve this riddle.
I firmly believe
that the subjects here
will never be able
to forget this moment.
They will never be
able to forget it, trader.
No doubt about it!
They will never forget this moment.
How far is the northern exit?
Trader.
Where are you going?
What work do you have here?
I.. I was going to
take some fresh air.
We are not fools.
Come here. Hey..
Pull!
Pull it..
Pull it with all your power.
I am sure these shackles
will become weak.
Come on, drag them.
The people of Magadh, this riddle
is a small example of physics.
When you drag something
from the reverse direction
it becomes weak.
But this trick is known
only by those who are intelligent.
And you all know that no one
is as intelligent as me
in the whole of Magadh.
Oh! Why did you stop? Drag it.
'I hope Chandragupta is close
to the completion of this task.'
Come soon, this way.
Come, everyone.
Stul should have reached here by now.
I don't know where he is.
Oh! Trust me.
Princess Durdhara has called me.
Leave him!
He is telling you the truth.
Did you bring what I had asked you to?
- Yes, princess.
- Come with me.
How did you know that
I will need your help?
Not me but Acharya knew it.
He has sent me here.
Drag it hard..
Yes, everyone! Put some more power..
Help your king in solving
this age old riddle.
Come on, harder!
Even Emperor Dhananand
could not solve this riddle.
I am surprised!
Who will solve this now?
Get down one after the
other with the help of this rope.
Do it soon.
Children,
it is time to take the last leap
to get rid from the
shackles of Dhananand.
This sand villa looks
so attractive and divine.
Right? But even a normal wave
is enough to destroy it.
Similarly,
the wealth, happiness and majesty
which we have gathered by
being unvirtuous and unrighteous
collapses before
a small wave of truth.
Remember this the truth which
we posses by being virtues
carries greater value
than the comfort we earn
by walking on the
path of unrighteousness.
My ethics..
Your destiny.
No one can solve this riddle.
And I assure you
that this has a solution.
Is there anyone here
who can solve this riddle?
Look over there.

================================================================================

Episode: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2NxQgN_Guk

Children
it is time to take the plunge
and break free from
the shackles of Dhananand.
Go. Be careful.
Hurry.
I will be right back.
But where are you going Chandra?
There is something important
that I must accomplish.
Come.
- Wait.
- Yes, Princes Durdhara?
What is going on?
Someone has infiltrated the prison.
I am on my way to alert the emperor.
If you go to him without the culprit
he will definitely kill you.
You should capture the infiltrator
while I alert the emperor.
As you say.
Durdhara.
You?
What are you doing here?
This place is teeming with guards.
You should go and save the children.
I am not leaving you
behind this time, Durdhara.
Do not be a fool, Chandra.
We will not make it out of here.
Why? When the children can escape
why cannot you?
Come with me.
This is extremely risky, Chandra.
Look into my eyes.
Do you think I intend
to leave you behind?
Now, do as I say.
Ready?
Chandra.
I know you are tired
but this is not the time to rest.
We must get going.
All right.
You can lead the children to safety.
What about you?
How can I pass up an opportunity
to humiliate your brother
in front of his subjects?
Merchant!
You tricked us!
It is abundantly clear
that this is not a riddle.
It is a cunning means to earn money.
No one can solve this riddle.
Now I know!
No, Rakshas.
This is no trick.
This is a genuine riddle.
And I assure you
that this has a solution.
Is there anyone here
who can solve this riddle?
Tell me!
Yes, there is, Emperor.
'This red hot iron spear'
'will solve the riddle.'
Chandragupta!
Where did the trader go?
Chanakya and Chandragupta
orchestrated this to distract me
so that they could free the children.
Chandragupta!
- Hail King Chandragupta!
- Hail!
- Hail King Chandragupta!
- Hail!
- Hail King Chandragupta!
- Hail!
Chandragupta,
I am impressed with your intelligence.
Finally,
you solved the impossible riddle.
It was about knowing the secret
that no one could understand
until now, Acharya.
That statue of the
lion was made of wax.
When that trader came
to you with this riddle
in scorching sun
I saw a few drops of
molten wax in that cage.
I understood that the statue
of the lion was made of wax.
So, to free it we do
not need to break the cage.
We just needed to melt the wax.
Well done!
You not only solved
that impossible riddle
but you also verified
the prophecy linked with it.
It stated that whoever
solves that riddle
will become the future
emperor of united India.
Acharya, I have believed
in it from the day
you saw me for the first time and said
that you see the future
emperor of united India in me.
Your words are more important
to me than any prophecy.
Do not lie, Chandragupta.
You never believed me.
How does that matter, Acharya?
At least, I solved the riddle.
- Hail King Chandragupta!
- Hail!
Hey!
Amatya Rakshas!
It is better to accept defeat
when it is evident that you have lost.
Keep the flames of
anger alive in your heart
just the way I am doing it.
With this flame,
we will burn our enemies
to ashes.
Where is my elder
brother Dashasidhika?
Do not be a fool, Dashasidhika.
It can prove dangerous
to go against Dhananand.
He is not merciful to the rebels.
He is alive due to
the mercy of others.
I have the key to his empire.
The power and strength are his pride..
Now, I have the key to control
all those districts and regions.
And I will put Dhananand
in his right place.
Come with me.
We will create our own world.
No one will be able to interrupt us.
Leave me, Dashasidhika.
I said, leave me!
I have told you multiple times
that I never had any feelings for you.
Today, I am reminding you again.
I do not love you.
Why do you not understand?
I have power! I control
all the strength and authority.
All the districts
are under my control.
So, come with me.
Moreover, you hate Dhananand.
Leave him. Come with me!
- Hail King Chandragupta!
- Hail!
- Hail King Chandragupta!
- Hail!
- Hail King Chandragupta!
- Hail!
- Hail King Chandragupta!
- Hail!
Only a mother can understand the pain
of being separated
from her child, Chandra.
Years ago, Dhananand had separated us.
Today
he did the same to the families
of these 14 districts.
But you
united these shattered families,
Chandra.
I cannot tell you
how proud I am of you.
Mother, a sword is not valorous.
People who use the sword are valorous.
I could do this as I had
Acharya and your blessings.
Chandragupta, as usual
you are giving the credit
of your good deeds to me.
But as your teacher
on one hand, this world gives me
the credit of your good deeds
and on the other hand
I get blamed for the
things you do not do.
What do you mean?
What did I not do, Acharya?
It means you always forget
about a special thing.
You always forget
about a special person.
I am talking about Durdhara.
She is standing next to you.
Oh! I did not notice
that you were standing here.
Is it so?
Yes, Mother. This is the truth.
I was not paying attention
as I am thinking about
an important thing.
No one will be able to taunt
my teacher, Acharya Chanakya
due to my actions.
Durdhara
you have faced many
challenges in your life.
You have faced all
the problems courageously.
But from this moment onwards
I want to ensure you
that be it happiness or sorrows
both of us
will face it together.
So, I want to assure you
that we will
get married today
and be united
forever.
You could never be trusted
Brother Dashasidhika.
It is good that you revealed
your true intentions.
You are misunderstanding me.
I have done n-nothing.
Your Highness
you were right.
Chandragupta has freed the 13 princes.
Not only that,
but this message has been recovered
from your brother,
Dashasidhika's room.
Read the message, Amatya Rakshas.
'Dashasidhika, according to our pact'
'if you keep supporting me I will
crown you the king of Takshashila.'
'According to the pact'
'you have to kill Ambikumar.'
'The way you helped me
in freeing the Prince of Avanti'
'help me in freeing the
princes of the rest 13 districts.'
'Wishing to meet you again'
'Chandragupta Maurya.'
I do not know anything
about this message.
I do not know how it reached my room.
Do you not know anything?
You betrayed me and had
bad intentions towards Tara.
Yet, you do not know anything.
Anyway, I would not have spared you,
but now..
Now, you have broken my patience.
Your jealousy has brought
you here, Brother.
You always wanted my throne
and my power.
Now, you want the one I love.
You were always deluded
that you deserved
whatever I had.
Am I right?
No..
You deserve only one thing.
Do you want to know what it is?
I had told you
that one with bad
intentions towards Tara
would be killed
so brutally and slowly by me
that he would feel
every breathe and every
drop of blood leave his body
and this death
is being experienced by you, Brother.
A crocodile is considered
the strongest aquatic animal.
So, do the fishes
become its food on their own?
On the other hand, a lion
is considered the forest's king.
So, do the deer go to
its cave and present themselves
as its prey?
No. It does not matter
how powerful you are.
You cannot accomplish a
task just by thinking about it.
You can accomplish a task
by working hard and
putting in efforts.
Do remember this.
If you want to excel
you have to work
hard and put in efforts.
If you want to excel continuously
you have to keep working hard for it.
My ethics..
Your destiny.
Bhutapala, Tara is the roots
of all the trouble.
We have to remove her out of our way
without informing His Majesty.
Do you have news of Tarini?
I do, but it is not good news.

================================================================================

Episode: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61TMZlXKXio

Your Majesty!
Your Majesty!
Open the door, Your Majesty.
Your Majesty!
Can you hear me, Your Majesty?
It has been 15 hours since you
locked yourself in this chamber.
Neither have you eaten anything
nor are to talking to anybody.
I request you to open the door.
Open the door, Your Majesty.
Amatya, please allow me.
Allow me to speak with Dhananand.
Keep quiet.
I do not like when anybody interferes
between His Majesty and me.
Just leave.
- Your Majesty, open the door.
- You are his well-wisher, are you not?
Do not stop me.
It may not benefit him,
but cause harm.
Really?
You are so confident.
His Majesty shall open
the door at your behest?
Try your luck.
Go ahead.
Dhananand, it is me, Tara.
Have you tried?
Did he open the door?
Go away!
Bhutapala,
Tara is the roots of all the trouble.
We have to remove her out of our way
without informing His Majesty.
No, Amatya.
Death penalty will be
a very easy punishment for
the sin that she has committed.
What have you thought, Bhutapala?
She is the reason
why brother lost faith
in brother, Dashasidhika.
And I shall make her be at the brothel
and witness her dignity
and pride get tarnish.
Proceed!
Chandra.
What happened?
Why do you look scared and restless?
You will understand my situation
when you get married.
It is different about me.
And you are different.
What!
Because you are the future king.
And as far as I know
the kings are allowed
to marry more than once.
Therefore, if this marriage
does not fulfill your expectation
then you can marry again.
Stul!
Durdhara..
Do not mind Stul.
He speaks more than required.
Lady Mura, I am upset with you.
You could have scolded Stul later.
I wanted to know
Chandra's point of view.
But..
You can question him by yourself.
Whatever you want to know..
Know it by yourself.
Why did you say that
you wanted to know my view?
You would have known by now
what my answer would have been.
What would it be?
That neither did I have
anyone in the past
nor do I have anyone
in my life at present.
And there cannot be
anybody in the future.
And..
And?
That you very important
and special to me.
Nobody can take your place.
And?
Why are you asking so many questions?
Tell me clearly as to
what you want to hear from me.
I will say that.
Because I..
I love you very much, Princess.
This is what I wanted to hear.
Do not get emotional.
It becomes difficult to understand
if these tears are of sorrow
or happiness.
Now, the groom will
fulfill the ritual.
[Sanskrit chants]
'Chandra,
I am happy that I have got you.'
'But I am also sad'
'that today,
as I enter a great bond in my life..'
'I am leaving a great bond.'
'A great bond that
I had with my brother.'
I do not need your sympathy.
Durdhara has not left you.
You drove her away.
She was hoping that
her brother would change
and he would come to her.
But her brother did not go to her.
I did not go to her?
You think that Durdhara was right
as she went away from me, Tara?
You think that I deserve this.
Right?
I may be a cruel
and tyrant for the world
and I may deserve
a worst fate than this
but Durdhara..
No!
I gave everything to Durdhara!
All the love
and care I had in my evil heart
I had always dedicated
all of it for her.
So Durdhara..
No!
It is not right for her
to leave me like this!
I do not deserve her hatred.
[Sanskrit shlok]
[Sanskrit shlok]
[Sanskrit shlok]
'The lone star in the sky of heart!'
'My dear little sister!
I welcome you!'
These paintings mean nothing!
Nothing!
Heed me, Dhananand!
You must listen to me!
Do I not know why you are here?
You are not here as
you are worried for me!
You are not affected
by me not eating my meals!
You have come here to see me in pain.
Am I right?
Is this what you think of me?
So tell me,
what should I think now? Tell me!
From where does this
immense love thrive for me?
Is the hatred I sense
in your voice true
or the love you claim
to have for me in your heart?
Answer me!
You have none!
Leave from here!
What?
Yes!
Leave and never show
me your face again!
You always wanted to
leave from here, right?
Now you do have a chance.
Leave!
You will not leave?
Then so be it!
Go!
May your husband live long!
May you always be happy!
May you have a long life!
Dear, this poor priest
can only bless you
as a gift, on this day.
Do not say so, Acharya.
You can give me the greatest gift.
I ask you for a promise as a gift.
I want this marriage
to be Chandra's strength
and not shackles that hold him back.
I know that I have married the future
Lord of the united land of India
and I know that his motherland
means more to him than I do.
So I ask of you.
Please show no lenience
in his training.
And if you wish to
show any clemency to him
then I ask you not to do so.
Let him walk the path of hardships.
Since he is not alone
but he has me with him.
For the land of India
and for Chandra..
No matter what you decide,
I stand by you.
Agreed, dear.
I will strive hard
to keep this promise.
Acharya!
- Acharya.
- Do you have news of Tarini?
I do, but it is not good news.
I used to meet Tarini
everyday to ensure her safety
but she did not rendezvous today.
Chandragupta..
Tarini never does such a thing
which means, this is not a good sign.
She is surely in trouble.
I have a feeling, Amatya Rakshas
has something to do with it.
Do not forget
that my brother Dashasidhika
is very close to Elder Bhutapala.
He will certainly
exact revenge on Tarini.
Acharya,
we must ensure Tarini's safety.
Yes.
Mansa, find a solution
to Tarini's problem.
Chandragupta, you must come with me.
Acharya!
I agree that Mansa
can handle this situation
but I believe,
I should assist her on this.
Because Tarini has helped
us at every stage of our lives.
Mansa is capable
of solving this problem.
You must assist me for
something more important.
Let us go.
Welcome to your new abode.
Your future is going
to be like theirs.
You will live the life of a courtesan.
And Dhananand will
have no clue about it.
He will assume that you left
him again, like you did once before.
Give her the concoction.
Groom her like a courtesan.
Dress her well.
Go!
Tara!
Tara..
Tara!
Tara!
Tara! Amatya..
Have you seen Tara?
I told her to leave.
I wonder why I did that.
Do you know where she is?
After she went to see you,
she left, Your Majesty.
No, Amatya.
She couldn't have left me again.
We must find her. Look for her.
She wouldn't have gone very far.
Tara! Tara!
Whatever I did, Your Majesty
was for your sake.
What is the matter, Acharya?
Why are we in this chamber?
Acharya,
I am deeply concerned for Tarini.
Please tell me clearly
what you are planning
because we do not have
time for riddles, Acharya.
We will talk about this soon,
Chandragupta.
But before that
you must eat this.
What! Acharya,
what are you talking about?
I am not even hungry.
This is not a request.
This is an order.
Eat this food, Chandragupta.
Acharya..
You have often surprised me
with your strange behaviour.
And today, you have shocked me.
You have locked me up in a chamber
and are forcing me to eat,
while I am not even hungry.
Acharya, why are you..
I poisoned your food.
If I drop this alum
in a clay pot full of water
it will make all the
contaminants in the water
settle to the bottom,
turning the water pure.
You may consider that patience
is like the alum of life.
Because just the way
this alum can purify water
similarly patience
can purify our minds
during troubled times from
anxiety and negative thoughts
and it can enable
us to think straight.
Remember that the ones who
fail to attain patience in life
always remain stuck with instability.
My ethics..
Your destiny.
You are behind Tara's
sudden disappearance.
Amatya, tell me truth.
You still have time, Amatya.

================================================================================

Episode: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fg1ZTiBxI58

Acharya,
you spiked my food with poison.
But you don't have to worry.
Finish your meal.
Do you want me to eat all of this?
Yes, Chandragupta.
This is the law of nature.
When a person reaches
the peak of success
he will develop many
enemies in the world.
Today, you have married Durdhara
the beloved sister of
Dhananand the King of Magadh.
Soon, you will dethrone him
and become the emperor of Bharat.
You will attack Dhananand,
continuously.
Do you think he'll
be a mere spectator?
Will he not retaliate?
Eat.
A wicked person like Dhananand
will poison your happy life.
And there's a very old proverb
'Only a poison can cure poison.'
And today,
we will make that proverb manifest.
In the same manner, everyday
I will add a small quantity
of poison in your food
due to which your body will develop
an immunity to poison.
Chandragupta, a day will come
when you will not get harmed
by any poison in this world.
And then, you will not be harmed
by any attack from Dhananand
regardless of whether it's
an attack by a weapon, poison
or a poisonous woman.
But.. But Mansa..
She's just one person.
Do you really think
she's one of a kind?
Yes, Chandragupta.
You might be unaware of this
but Mansa told me
that there are many
poisonous women like her.
Think about it.
If one of them
succeeds in trespassing your
security and gets anywhere near you
it could prove dangerous
for you and our goals.
Hereafter, you will eat
the food given by me only.
I quantity of poison I will add
will not harm your health.
Slowly
your immunity to poison will increase.
After that,
no poison will be able to harm you.
But before we put
this plan into action
I will repeat what I have
been telling you until today.
If you want a plan to succeed..
No one should learn
about the plan.
Yes.
And there's another reason behind
keeping this plan a secret.
People who love you immensely
they cannot be stringent
enough to see you consuming poison.
Acharya, you are underestimating
the strength and caliber
of the people who love Chandragupta.
Go, bring Tarini.
Who are you?
Soon, you'll know who I am.
During this training
I will support Chandra.
And this is my promise to you.
The information about this training
will not go beyond this chamber.
You're felicitous, Your Majesty.
But remember
this training will not be easy.
If Bharat has to taste freedom
Chandragupta has
to consume the poison.
Like the way Lord Shiva
consumed poison
in order to protect the earth
similarly
Chandragupta has to consume
poison in order to protect Bharat.
Eat.
Amazing!
I have never seen
a beautiful woman like
you in my entire life.
Tell me your price.
I want a word, not price.
If you want me,
then you have to agree with something.
I will become yours
only if you will not touch
any other woman here, except me.
Especially, not her.
Her beauty can attract anyone.
My brother dreams of her
but not me.
I just like you.
Everyone just leave.
You too just go, Tarini.
'I have saved Tarini from
your evil eyes, Bhutapala.'
'Now, there are only few
moments left in your life.'
'As soon as I find the stuff,
for which I was sent here'
'your death is certain
at that very moment.'
Let me go in, Mother-in-law.
I want to meet Chandra.
No, Durdhara.
My principles do
not allow me to do that.
'Many people were struggling
in their own levels.'
'But no one either saw, or ever heard'
'of the kind of struggle that
Chandragupta was going through.'
'Chandragupta,
who was locked inside that room'
'consumed poison in little amounts
for next few days'
'so that he can slowly develop poison
resistant capacity in his body'
'so that he can be ready
for every possible attack'
'from King Dhananand.'
'The way Chandragupta
was standing against Dhananand'
'with all his capacity and strength'
'the same way the whole
country was slowly raising'
'its voice against Dhananand.'
'The light of united India was slowly
making the whole country bright.'
'Along with Avanti,
Kandahar, Kamboj and Anga'
'almost everyone were
hailing Chandragupta.'
'After the accidental
death of Dashasiddhika'
'no one was in a condition
to take the responsibility'
'the law and order of all
the states under Dhananand.'
'But Dhananand was unaware
of the chaos in his kingdom'
'and had completely become alcoholic.'
'As Durdhara and Tarini
suddenly left him'
'he was stunned and hurt.'
'The person who once wanted
to rule the whole India'
'and not just the land,
but wanted to rule everyone's life'
'became steady like a stone.'
'It became emotionless.'
'He was beyond all the
worries of his chaotic kingdom.'
Why did you do this, Tarini?
Why have you
left me alone?
'On one side, Dhananand
was lost in Tarini's memories'
'and was longing
just to see her once.'
'On the other side, Tarini and Mansa'
'were continuously
working on distracting'
'his brother,
Bhutapala, to destroy his kingdom'
'so that they can get
confidential information'
'related to Magadh Kingdom from him.'
How will this locker get unlocked?
This is definitely the same book
which has all the information regarding
Dhananand's intelligence system.
I have to give this to
Chandragupta at the earliest
by which he can destroy
Dhananand's intelligence system.
Look at her.
Dhananand's beloved
is now a mere servant of mine.
I expect you have filled my liquor.
Yes.
I have completed all my work here.
Chandragupta!
Look.
So, this is how Dhananand
gets an information
regarding every small incident
taking place in his kingdom
so quickly.
Yes.
Dhananand is wicked.
He's a sly
but I have never doubted
his intelligence even a bit.
Using his intelligence
he has formed such a
strong and a smooth running
intelligence system.
And its specialty
is that people at every
level in the society
is given a chance to serve.
He may be fisherman or a merchant.
He may be a servant or a
labourer working in the cemetery.
They are all the part
of his intelligence system.
Chandragupta,
they are those people in the society
from who nothing can be hidden.
Nor anyone can doubt them.
They are the people
who give Dhananand the information
about every small or big incident
taking place in Magadh
or any other states.
Because of which, his intelligence
system is so strong and powerful.
Using this information
we will destroy Dhananand's
intelligence system
and form our own intelligence system.
- Your Majesty..
- Stop right there, Mahamatya.
You cannot enter my chamber
until you tell me about Tara.
I beg your pardon, Your Majesty.
But there are many other
problems other than Tara
that you have to take care of.
People have become rebels.
The revolutionists are
increasing by each passing day.
You have to take control
over the kingdom.
And after seeing the situation I think
it would be appropriate
if Tara does not return.
It would be better for you
and also for Magadh.
Amatya, I do not know why but..
I feel
that you are behind
Tara's sudden
disappearance.
No, Your Majesty.
You still have time, Amatya.
Because if I get to
know this in later future
that you are involved
in Tara's disappearance
then I shall not think
twice before killing you.
Tell me.
- Where is Tara?
- She is..
I am here, Dhananand.
Tara..
Tara..
You have returned, Tara.
Where did you disappear?
Why did you go?
And where were you for all these days?
I.. I had gone to meet my mother.
To inform her
that I am going to stay
in Magadh for some more time.
I was certain that
you will not leave me.
There is a bad news, Your Majesty.
Who is he?
Our brother, Bhutapala.
Do you see this camphor?
The camphor has a specialty.
A small camphor is
capable of creating fire.
But if this camphor
is left in open
then it will come
in contact with the air
then it will vaporise in a few days
and it will disappear.
Just like this camphor
every human being is born
with a talent or quality.
But if a person is not
given the right opportunity
at the right time
to exhibit his talent
then he starts losing
his confidence and talent.
Remember one thing.
One can showcase his talent
when he is supported and encouraged.
My ethics..
Your destiny.
Look, Your Highness,
in this training center
I have hired the best snake catchers
of the world courtesans and soldiers.
They will help you, Durdhara and Mansa
in training these girls
to become Vishkanyas.

================================================================================

Episode: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LmEZhkw1JAE

Mother-in-law,
I request you to let me go inside.
I just want to give him food.
I will be happy to keep this plate
and get a glance of Chandra.
- Really..
- Yes, My Lady.
Let her go inside.
Why are there so many
obstacles for them to meet
when they are a newly-wed couple?
Stul.
I understand that
they got married recently
but they knew each
other since a long time.
Durdhara, listen to your heart
and if you still want to go inside
I will not stop you.
But do remember
the bigger the liability,
the greater the sacrifice.
Your marriage is not ordinary.
The future of this nation depends
on your matrimonial alliance.
Where do you get all this power from?
The source of my power
is my love towards Chandra.
Durdhara, you have the same power too.
You came out of this
room all by yourself
- which means that..
- Yes.
I have completed the training
given to me by Acharya.
There's only one person
behind the demise of Rashtrapal
Dashasidhika and now Bhutapala,
Your Majesty.
She is the one!
Tara!
Your Majesty, I ask you to ban her
from entering this state ever again.
Or else, she will
kill everyone one by one.
Amatya, you know very well
who can kill a person
in such a manner!
Tara cannot kill him
because she cannot spew venom.
This can definitely be done
by Mansa, who is your secret weapon.
Tell me.
Is it Mansa who betrayed my trust?
The same Mansa who
was brought to me by you?
So why should I not
ban you from Magadh
for killing my elder brother,
Bhutapala?
Do you not have an answer?
Amatya, now you will
have to do one thing for me.
And you should not lack
anything in that.
Arrange for a ceremony
after the last rites
of Bhutapala are performed.
A ceremony which will remain
in the memory of people
for a long time to come.
Pardon me, Your Majesty.
You have lost three brothers
in the last few days.
These are tough times
for the royal family.
How can you conduct a
ceremony in such a situation?
I can!
I can do anything!
My brothers will give me best wishes
when they come to know
that this ceremony is being conducted
for their emperor and
brother's most important day.
From heaven..No..
They would be impressed
watching from the doors of hell!
Pardon me, Your Majesty.
What is so important
on the day of this ceremony?
In that ceremony, Tara and I
will become one.
We both will bond forever
in the holy alliance of a marriage.
Wedding!
Forever.
What are you thinking?
I was wondering about the difference
between the life before
and after marriage.
What do you mean?
I mean, it has been
many days since our marriage
but we are yet to spend
our life like a married couple.
Durdhara, If you are not
satisfied with this marriage
you can always tell me.
What are you saying, Chandra?
Nothing is more valuable
to me than this marriage.
Look, Mansa has returned.
Who are all these
young women with Mansa?
Meet Chandragupta Maurya,
the prince of Piplivan.
And this is his wife Durdhara,
the princess of Magadh.
But, Mansa, who are these women?
These women were forced
by Bhutapala to be courtesans.
And they have come from his brothel.
We know
that it is inappropriate
for us to come here uninvited.
But we are here since
Lady Mansa brought us.
If you are not pleased
by our presence here
- we will leave.
- There is no displeasure.
Those who exploit should
be uncomfortable and ashamed.
Not the ones who won
against the exploitation.
You have escaped that hell.
You should be proud of yourselves.
Queen is absolutely right.
You were exploited by
Dhananand's brother Bhutapala.
And the objective of our revolution
is to uplift the afflicted
and destitute all over India.
I know that because of
your hardship and affliction
you are feeling
vengeful in your hearts.
If you use that vengeance
to support the revolution
then I will be very fortunate.
But do it only if
you find it appropriate.
You are not indebted
to do anything here.
We had embraced the hellish
life offered by Bhutapala.
We had resigned ourselves to it.
But here we are provided with a life
of honour and direction.
We will certainly take
part in this revolution.
In other words, Acharya
we will train these
women to be Vishkanya.
Yes, Chandragupta.
We will form a special army with them.
An army of Vishkanyas.
Yes, Acharya.
Under you and Mansa's leadership
we will train them
in warfare and espionage.
So that we can spread
our people all over India.
Without a doubt.
But this will only
be possible when they join
the revolution wholeheartedly.
We are ready.
'In that ceremony, Tara and I'
'will become one.'
'That day, we both'
'will get married.'
Listen, get the most
fragrant and fresh flowers.
The King has ordered
the decoration of his
wedding should be perfect.
Understood? Go.
It is good that you came here.
In the wedding,
when we will wear similar clothes
and sit in the wedding stage
then we will look great.
Dressmaker make sure to stitch
the clothes according to my advice.
It would be better
if you get me a shroud.
I will happily sit with
you on the stage wearing that.
In line with your behaviour
you did the same mistake.
Without my consent
without knowing my desires
you declared our wedding suddenly.
Let me remind you
you can't force me to marry you.
I'm not your prisoner
to accept all your orders.
I won't let you take control of me.
I know everything.
This is your plot.
By marrying me,
you want me to be next to you always.
This isn't love
this is your plot
which you want me to fall for.
But remember
even if you force me to marry you
but I will never be yours.
I will be yours
but you won't get my love,
my acceptance.
Here.
Drink water
and calm down.
I don't want water from you.
Look at yourself.
You might hate me or be angry
or annoyed with me,
but the truth is that
at the moment,
you are standing with me.
If you wanted, you could have
stayed away from me but you didn't.
You are here with me.
Why is it so?
Only you can answer my question.
Very cleverly you interpreted
my feelings according to you
and hid the truth again.
Truth?
Yes, it's true that I don't
want to stay away from you
but for that I do not
have to marry you, Tara.
If I want,
I can keep you here for lifetime
without even marrying you.
But I didn't.
Because this wedding is not
just for my happiness but for you.
For my sake!
Dhananand, since when have
you risen above your selfishness
and started thinking about others?
I am sure that you definitely
have some selfish motive
behind this marriage proposal.
Tell me. What is the real
reason behind this marriage proposal?
What do you have to gain from this?
Yes.
I do have a selfish motive.
Do you want to know the reason?
Then listen.
It does not affect me in any way
but I cannot bear to hear
even a single word against you.
Many people in this palace think
that you are the root cause
of all the problems in my life.
That you have come here to destroy me.
Everyone here thinks
of you as a rebel.
Everyone says bad things
about you in hushed tones.
I want to shut all their mouths.
That is why,
I want to marry you, Tara.
So that I can make all those people
who talk ill of you shut up,
even if it is my siblings, friends
or the entire Magadh Kingdom
so that I can make them dumb.
I want all those people
who see you as rebel
bow their heads down
with respect in front of you.
This is my selfish motive.
This is the place where
you all will get trained.
And this place will be
closely guarded round the clock.
Bear this in mind.
You are free to discontinue this training
in the middle and leave from here.
You have that right.
But yes, you should not discuss about
whatever happens here with anyone.
None of us will go anywhere.
You have rescued us.
We all are indebted to you.
So, all of us will support
you in realising your dream
of an undivided India.
Mother, whatever I am today,
it is only because of you.
That is why, I want you to take the
responsibility of
training all these girls.
Chandra, I will support
you till my last breath.
But, Acharya, how are we going to train
all these girls to become Vishkanyas?
A single person will
not be able to do this.
Do not worry, Your Highness.
I have formed a special
team to help you
Mansa and Durdhara
in training these girls.
Come with me.
Look, Your Highness,
in this training center
I have hired the best
snake catchers of the world
courtesans and soldiers.
They will help you, Durdhara and Mansa
in training these girls
to become Vishkanyas.
Mother, the snake catchers will catch
the deadly poisonous snakes
and extract poison from them.
The physicians will prepare
antidotes for those poisons.
And the courtesans under
the supervision of Acharya
will inject the right amount of
poison into the bodies of these girls.
And our expert soldiers
will train all of them in warfare.
This way, all these girls will
become skilled and expert Vishkanyas.
Have you ever wondered
why the long and complicated
process of separating the
grain from its husk is done?
That is because, if the grain
is not separated from its husk
it will not only make it heavy
but will also make
the person eating it choke.
Worries are similar to this.
They, like the husk,
take over our mind and personality.
They are not needed in our lives.
They not only bog us down
but even stop us from
becoming successful in life.
Bear this in mind,
if you want to be successful in life
free your mind and
personality of all worries
which are like the husk.
My ethics..
Your destiny.
Time has Chandragupta,
when we will have to
hand over our main responsibility
of our revolt to Tarini.
You're right.
If Tarini becomes Dhananand's wife
then no one can have doubt on her.
And she will easily do the work
that we ask her to do.

================================================================================

Episode: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jKyVSiLcVk

Why is he not here yet?
He should have been here by now.
Durdhara, what are you doing here?
Acharya and everyone
else is waiting for you.
Right. I am waiting for someone here.
- Greetings, Princess.
- Greetings.
Here are the lamps that you asked for.
Which among these
is made in Patliputra?
This is the one I want.
By keeping this with me,
though I am away from home
I will feel I am at home.
Wonderful, Princess. I bow down
both to you and your royal articles.
Everything is still the same.
Nothing has changed.
You are still the same.
This lamp is not for the decoration
but for information.
What do you mean?
I mean, I want to find out every
incident taking place in Magadh.
For which I find out
some new and unique methods.
Durdhara, I feel blessed for having
married an intelligent woman like you.
I can surely do this for a revolution
in which young girls are
ready to sacrifice themselves.
We.. We have to notify
this to Acharya at the earliest.
Come soon.
This
- is a good news.
- Acharya
what are you saying?
Tarini is going to marry Dhananand.
How can this be a good news?
Undoubtedly, Chandragupta.
This is definitely a good news.
One of our companion
is doing something beyond
the responsibilities given to her
she is exceeding our expectations.
Tarini is marrying Dhananand.
Just imagine.
We sent Tarini as a spy there.
What more can a spy do for us,
Chandragupta?
Acharya, you are right.
If Tarini marries Dhananand
no one will doubt her.
She can complete every work
we assign to her very easily.
'Ambhikumar harmed you?'
'I will take you for
the treatment, myself.'
'Not needed.
I can take care of myself.'
'Stop me if you can.'
What happened, Durdhara?
You do not look happy.
No. There is no such thing.
I am happy that emperor
and Tarini are getting married.
[Sanskrit shlok]
[Sanskrit shlok]
[Sanskrit shlok]
Tara, do you see a
smile on everyone's face?
It is not an ordinary smile
but a symbol of surrendering.
No one will ever doubt you, Tara.
I do not want this royal attire.
Bring my ordinary clothes for me.
Wear them, Your Highness.
The emperor got it made
specially for you.
You are actually lucky.
Emperor loves you, dearly.
You have no idea when
you left him years ago
he was left all alone
after parting from you.
He searched you in every
corner of the kingdom.
But he did not find you.
It took him quite long
to come out of your departure.
'Why did you not search for me'
'if you were really
missing me so much?'
'You are an emperor.'
'If you wished,
you could have searched for me'
'not only in this world,
but in the entire Universe.'
'I did not search for you.'
'Because emperors
don't do such things.'
'Do you love me so much, Dhananand'
'that you hid such a
big truth from me till now?'
'While Tarini was going
through an emotional turmoil'
'at the same time,
Chandragupta and Chanakya'
'not only studied Dhananand's
espionage tactics'
'and failed it'
'but also developed a new
espionage tactic of their own.'
'They joined hands with
the people of Punjab and Sindh'
'and formed a special
battalion of their own.'
'They trained that
battalion in complicated'
'battle tactics and surgical strikes.'
'On the other hand,
after getting Tarini back'
'Dhananand had come
out of the depression'
'which he was suffering from'
'after he was separated from her.'
Tara, you have come!
Sit.
See. I have got all these delicacies
prepared specially for you, Tara.
Come on, have them.
If not for my sake,
at least eat for the sake
of those workers who
have worked so very hard
and made these
delicacies for your sake.
Attendant, tell the chief minister
that I will regularly
attend the court every day.
Ask him to keep the list
of important matters ready.
Okay, Your Highness.
Tara
you really have made
my incomplete life, complete.
Because of you, I once
again have come out of depression
and have got a desire to live.
'Making his love for
Tarini as his inspiration'
'Dhananand very easily accomplished'
'the thing which his brother and
chief minister had failed to accomplish.'
'He brought the rebellion
in all his states under control'
'and re-established
his rule over his kingdom.'
'On one side, Tarini was struggling'
'to choose any one between her duties'
'towards the undivided India'
'and the feelings she
was developing for Dhananand.'
'On the other side'
'Mura, Durdhara and Mansa were busy'
'giving a new definition
to women power.'
'With their hard work
and ceaseless efforts'
'they were building'
'a special battalion of poison maidens
against Dhananand.'
What is the matter?
Why are you looking at me like this?
I am observing that you are
fully trained to take my place.
Now, I do not have
any worries about Chandra.
Do not say so, Mother-in-law.
In my life, I have always undergone
the pain of not having a mother.
But now, by luck I have
got a mother-in-law like you.
I will not allow you to go anywhere.
Instead, you will have
to fulfil your duties as a mother
not only towards Chandra,
but towards all of us.
'What secret of Dhananand
is hidden behind this door.'
Open the chamber.
Tara, finally, you learnt the truth.
I am certain that you shall
give up your hatred towards me.
And I shall be waiting for that day.
The day I succeed in
changing your views about me
I shall get my Tara back.
And I am certain about it.
Your Majesty,
Chandragupta has gathered a huge
number of people to expand his army.
And they have caused
harm to our informer.
Therefore,
we cannot trust our informers.
Your Majesty,
we have to be alert after this.
Amatya, I did not
like this fruit earlier.
But now, I like it.
Your Majesty,
did you hear what I said?
What is Chandragupta
doing and what he can do?
We have to stop him.
Amatya..
In the war for power sometimes one
does not succeed by attacking first.
But we can change the game
by retaliating.
We have always attacked
and he always protected himself.
This time we will
let Chandragupta attack.
We will amuse him.
And we will make a strategy
which he is not ready for.
Acharya.
Chandra, in such a sort
time you have achieved a lot.
I am proud of you.
Mother, this was possible
only because with me
are two extremely strong women.
Durdhara and you.
In my opinion, before you proceed
to the next level of the war
Durdhara and you should
spend some time with each other.
No, Mother.
Until I return home I cannot
spare time for personal pursuits.
Mother, Piplivan is currently
under Dhananand's rule.
But it will not remain so
for a very long time.
No one can stop me from
conquering Piplivan this time.
But why do you feel
that conquering Piplivan
is going to be easy this time.
Because Dhananand is still unaware
that we have sent a mole in his house.
These are the clothes
that I had ordered to be made
especially for you, Tara.
Does that mean you have decided
to return in my life?
At long last
you have come back to me, Tara.
I always knew what people
said about you was untrue.
But I was confident that
you would never betray me.
I was certain that you still are
very much in love with me.
Yes.
I tried my best to hate you.
But today, I must accept
that I am still in love with you.
When a Cheetah decides
to chase a prey
he does not worry about whether
the other animals in the forest think
he is the fastest
running animal or not.
In that moment,
he focuses all his energies
on his goal,
that is, on chasing his prey
and rests only after he has caught it.
It is this quality
that earns him the repute
of being the most fearsome
predator in the forest.
We should also embrace this quality
of the Cheetah in our pursuits.
We may have our goal in sight
but we must direct all our energies,
abilities and confidence
in order to achieve it.
Remember, if we always worry
about the opinions and reactions
of others about yourself
you will never be able to leap towards
achieving your goal, like the Cheetah.
My ethics..
Your destiny.
Tarini's hatred towards
my brother has turned into love.
Is it not obvious
that she will betray you?
If Tarini wanted to betray me
then Dashasiddika and Bhutapala
would have been alive now.
Acharya, I am getting our army ready.

================================================================================

Episode: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lxgQJ2njoY

I was such a fool
to let you go away from me.
But now
I will not repeat the mistake again.
'Till now, you have shown the world'
'your atrocious and dreadful side,
Dhananand.'
'But being your wife'
'it is my duty to show
your reality to the world.'
'I will show the world that
you are not only a cruel emperor'
'but you also have a sea of love.'
'It is my promise that
I will change your image.'
'I firmly believe that my love'
'will pull you out from
the evil of darkness'
'which you have lost yourself in it.'
'To bring you back from your
evil side I will do whatever I can.'
'This is the only way to save
your life from Chandragupta.'
Today, I can see clearly see the image
of your father in you, Chandragupta.
That rage.. That bravery..
I firmly believe that
when he sees you from the
heavens fighting for your country
he will be feeling very proud.
Today, when you will
go to your homeland Piplivan
to free it from the
clutches of Dhananand
then this shield and
the sword of your father
will protect you.
With your courage and
the blessings of your father
you will come out victorious,
Chandragupta.
Mother, I promise that tomorrow
at the crack of dawn
Piplivan will get a new life
and a new freedom.
That's because by sunset
the flag of the Maurya clan
will fly high in
the palace of Piplivan.
I promise you that.
May you be victorious.
We have to go, Chandragupta.
Very soon,
our message will be reaching Tarani.
According to our plan
she will compel Dhananand
to change his battle strategy.
Before that,
we have to reach Piplivan.
- Let us go.
- Of course, Acharya.
Stop, Chandra.
I would like to tell all of you a
very important thing before this war.
According to me we cannot
trust Tarini completely anymore.
'Chandragupta's message!'
'Tarini, I can understand
how difficult it was for you'
'to get married to someone
whom you hate so much.'
'We are proud of your
dedication and sacrifice'
'towards the revolution
for the cause of united India.'
'Hence, we rely on you to
achieve our next important goal.'
'Today, we are going free
Piplivan from Dhananand's rule.'
'And you have to make sure'
'that Dhananand chooses the
northern route to march to Piplivan.'
'But if he chooses the southern
route due to some reason'
'then you inform us immediately.
Chandragupta.'
Tara.
God knows why I am feeling
that Tarini's hatred
towards my brother
has turned into love.
If there is a spark of
love in any corner of her heart
it will take no time
to spread all over.
No, Durdhara.
Tarini does not love Dhananand.
She has only hatred towards Dhananand.
No, Chandra. I went through the same.
I could not resist myself to love you
despite knowing that
you were against my brother.
And see. We are married now.
The same apples to
Tarini and my brother.
They are married now.
You tell me.
Is it not obvious that Tarini
will go against you for her love?
Is it not obvious
that she will betray you?
Durdhara,
had Tarini wanted to betray me
then Dashasiddika and Bhootpal
would have been alive now.
When we rescued the children
of the heads of the kingdoms
Tarini could have informed Dhananand.
But she did not do that.
I think her marriage is an eyewash.
She is still dedicated
towards the cause of united India.
Okay, fine.
If you have so much faith in her
then I will accompany you in this war.
No, Durdhara.
You will not accompany me.
I do not want Dhananand
to have an impression
that I am using you as a shield
to win this war after our marriage.
Hence, you will not accompany me.
- Chandra..
- It is not a request of a husband.
It is an order of an emperor.
Acharya, I am getting our army ready.
- Acharya..
- Durdhara.
Chandragupta is always like this.
If he trusts someone he
shows complete faith in him.
But I will not ignore your suspicion.
Your Highness,
if Durdhara's suspicion is true
then we need to make a backup plan.
Certainly, Acharya.
But I am hoping that
Tarini will not betray us.
Even I am hoping the same.
What are you doing here?
Actually,
I was just lost in my thoughts.
I got it.
All of these look like a dream, right?
We are finally united
after so much of difficulties.
It looks like an illusion.
An illusion which can
break at any point of time.
We are now united forever.
No one can separate us.
This is my promise.
Tell me, Amatya.
What is it that you could
not stop yourself from coming here?
I am sorry, Your Highness.
But there is an important information
and it is necessary to tell you.
Just you.
I will be right back.
Amatya, whatever you want to say
say it in front of Taarini.
Tell me, Amatya.
The moment has come,
which you were waiting for.
Chandragupta has taken the first step
towards his destruction.
He sent his army towards Piplivan.
You are so lucky for me, Taarini.
As soon as you expressed
your love towards me
Amatya brought this good news.
You will see now how I will
kill Chanakya and Chandragupta.
I will kill Chandragupta,
the way I killed his father.
You told me that you
will never let me go far.
You said that you made a
mistake by sending me far from you.
And now, you are going
back to the same violence
because of which we got
separated many years ago.
You are going to repeat the same act
which separated you from me.
Do not compare my love towards you
with my hate towards
Chandragupta, Taarini.
These are two different situations.
You kept doing the same.
Why can you not choose the right path?
You want His Highness
to give his biggest enemy
the opportunity to do anything!
Show some respect, Amatya.
She is the queen of Magadh.
I apologise, Your Highness.
Apologise to your queen not to me.
I apologise
Your Majesty Taarini.
What do you want from me, Taarini?
What can I do to convince you?
Just do not stop me
from going for the battle
because no one can stop
me from going for the battle.
I am not stopping you from
going for the way, Dhananand.
But I want a promise from you.
Promise me that you will give life
to Chandragupta and Chanakya.
- Queen, if this happens..
- Amatya.
If this is your wish then fine.
I promise you that my sword
will not kill Chandragupta
and Chanakya.
Okay?
Amatya, get our army ready.
Our army will proceed towards
Piplivan from the south.
'We are going to free
Piplivan from Dhananand today'
'and you have to ensure'
'that Dhananand comes
to Piplivan from the north.'
'But if he comes from
the south due to any reason'
'inform us immediately. Chandragupta.'
According to me,
we should separate now.
The third and fourth army
will have to come with me.
One second.
Mother, why does the
army need to separate?
Everything is going
on as per our plan.
And Tarini has not sent any message.
This means, Dhananand has taken
the northern route for Piplivan.
Why are we doing this?
Acharya, is this your plan?
Why, Acharya?
Do you not trust Tarini?
Chandragupta,
we are in the situation of a war now
and trusting anybody so much now
will be equivalent
to trusting them blindly.
Only Durdhara knows what she saw.
But I trust Durdhara completely.
That is why I cannot
ignore her suspicion.
The queen will leave
from the southern direction
with one portion of the army.
We will go from the
northern direction.
Okay, Acharya.
If we are separating,
I will go with mother.
Chandra,
I do not need your protection.
I can take care of myself.
You go ahead and protect entire India.
Besides, Mansa and the army
of Takshashila are with me.
- But, Mother..
- No, Chandra.
Remember your promise.
You have to hoist
the flag of the Maurya Dynasty
in the palace of Piplivan.
Sure, Mother.
Promise me one thing.
When we gain victory over Piplivan you
will make that special 'kheer' for me
which you used to feed me
in the palace of Piplivan
during my childhood.
You are married now.
Ask your wife to
fulfil all your wishes.
But, Mother,
my wife does not know anything.
I have the best solution then.
Learn cooking.
Eat and feed her too.
And it is not necessary that
a mother and wife should cook.
Okay, Mother. I will definitely try.
Take care of yourself, Mother.
Before the arrival of rainy season
birds start building their nests.
So, they keep collecting grass
and other things continuously
so that they have a safe
place to stay when it rains.
We should also get
inspired from the birds
and follow this
principle in our lives.
If we want a secure and safe future
we should stay in our present
and collect money and other things.
Remember one thing.
The money collected today
can give us a happy and safe future.
My ethics..
Your destiny.
It was a good try Chanakya.
But this time none of
your plans will be successful.

================================================================================

Episode: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ncUdDpvIl1I

I know what you are thinking,
Mahamatya.
The promise I made
to Tara is worrying you.
Right?
You are my master.
I accord you the highest regard.
It is my duty to obey your command.
But I have not been able
to forget the prediction
that was made at the
time of your coronation.
Do you remember?
'I will destroy Piplivan
and become the emperor.'
'Forgive me, Your Highness.'
'Somebody else is destined
to be the emperor.'
'Four years ago I had made
the natal chart of a new born prince.'
'He was destined to
be undefeated in life.'
'No enemy can defeat him.'
'He will become the emperor.'
'The one who will unify
the Indian subcontinent.'
I haven't forgotten that
prediction either, Mahamatya.
You are well aware
that the one who tries
to be a threat to me
I put an end to his life instantly.
That means..
That means the promise
you made to Queen Tara..
- Will you dishonour it?
- No!
No, Mahamatya.
I cannot dishonour
the promise I made to Tara.
But you know
how innocent Tara is.
She gets trapped in
the tricky web of my words.
I said that I will not kill Chandragupta
and Chanakya with my sword
but it doesn't mean
I won't use Chandragupta's
sword to kill him.
Just like I had killed his father.
Brilliant!
Be it waging a war
or weaving a web of words
you are an expert at both,
Your Majesty.
You have provided me
a much needed relief.
Tara will never know the hatred
I have for Chanakya and Chandragupta.
But it is the first time when,
in order to fulfil her wish
I am resorting to trickery.
Once I put an end
to Chandragupta and Chanakya
I will start a happy
married life with Tara.
That is why I need to put an
end to that wretched at the earliest.
Hail..
Acharya, Durdhara was
getting worried for no reason.
Look there.
Dhananand is coming with his army.
Everything is going as
per the plan decided with Tarini.
Now we just need to stop them.
- What's this?
- What happened?
Acharya, Dhananand
is not leading the army.
What!
That means Durdhara was right.
Tarini didn't warn us
that Dhananand is approaching
from the South, not North.
Mother..
'Acharya's message was right.'
'Dhananand has attacked
from the South, not North.'
To what do I owe this honour?
Mahamatya..
Look who has walked
into the trap laid by us.
They had dreamt of outsmarting me.
What happened, Mura?
Didn't you get it?
I'll explain.
I am referring to your deceased
husband whom I had killed
at a nearby place!
And now,
destiny will make me repeat it.
As I will slay you
and then your wretched son!
With that..
With that,
the Mauryan clan will come to an end.
And then..
Your long cherished dream
will die a silent death.
Instead of reminding
me of my husband's death
I suggest you try
to recollect how my son
crafted a strategy and
killed all your brothers!
Very soon, even you
will join your brothers
in the netherworld.
My son's war cry
has shaken your throne!
Talking about putting
an end to the Mauryan clan..
You were scared of my son's
valour and tried to kill him
when he was an infant.
You can try once again.
You will fail as usual.
Attack!
Attack!
Attack!
Step forth..
We are ready.
Be quick!
We will stop only at Piplivan
once we start our journey.
According to His Majesty's orders,
they will wait for us there.
- Be quick!
- Yes!
Acharya, Chandra has left to help Mura
but I am sure that we will
defeat Dhananand's brothers
under your capable guidance.
You only have to order us what to do.
We will have to climb around 150
kms down and get to the muddy road.
From there we will
launch a surprise attack
on Pandu and Kaivarta's
armies and stop them from
advancing towards Piplivan.
- Acharya..
- What are you doing here?
I thought you left to protect Mura.
No, Stulbhadra, I have to
stay here and find a way to stop
them from advancing towards
us as soon as possible.
But, Chandra, Dhananand will himself
be with there with a great army.
You have to go there and help them.
We will take of this army.
Stulbhadra, when the sun raises today
I will have to free
my motherland from Dhananand
to fulfill my promise that
I have given to the mother.
No matter what happens today
no matter what changes
this promise will not change.
What about Mura?
Motherland is more
important than mother.
If I now go to mother
I will never be able
to repay my motherland.
I know Mother.
She will be proud of me
when she learns that I chose
my motherland over her.
Everyone,
get ready to attack on my signal.
"Chandragupta Maurya.."
Acharya, I sometimes think
if your training had
a positive effect on Chandra
or if it is negative.
Stulbhadra,
history only considers the result
and not right and wrong.
The history only considers heroism.
And I am happy
that would-be emperor of India
has understood this very well.
That his duties and loyalty
towards the motherland
are greater than any other bond.
'The history knows everything.'
'But every event
in future is a mystery.'
'The history was unaware
that Chandragupta displayed'
'great courage and patriotism.'
'It was a historical day
when the future emperor of India'
'valued the protection of
his motherland over his mother.'
It is one thing to fight my army
but fighting me
is a whole other matter.
You will realise that
in this very moment.
Do not forget,
Dhananand, I am a 'Kshatrani'!
Years of your torture
did not break me.
Why do you think I
will bow down to you now!
Come on, attack me!
Standing before you is not your
servant but the queen of Piplivan.
I will take revenge
for all your tortures!
Come! Attack me!
This is for taking
away my husband from me.
This is for keeping
me servant in your palace.
For crushing my self-respect!
And this is for all the tortures
you inflicted on me, Dhananand!
Your Majesty,
those are the armies of Panchala
and Sindh that left for Chandragupta.
So that Chanakya already knew
that we could attack
from from the west.
So he had an additional army ready.
Of course, Dhananand.
You must have had an estimate
of Chanakya's intelligence by now.
Before facing a sly man like you,
he is always ready with a backup plan.
My son promised me, Dhananand.
The Mauryan flag will flutter in
Piplivan's palace before today's dusk.
I am sure my son has repaid his debt
towards the motherland.
You have two options left.
Surrender yourself or die.
Save me, Brother Pandu and Kaivarta.
Protect me!
His Majesty sent us here
with a mission!
We have to protect Piplivan palace!
Brother!
It is better to protect my life
than protect my brother's
selfish dreams.
Come!
No, Brother! Stop! Protect me!
Do not leave me behind!
You should know
that I will not back down
from the promise I gave to mother.
I would do anything
to acquire Piplivan.
Stop..
I can be of use to you.
- Any important information?
- Yes..
There is a secret of Dhananand
that only he and his brothers know.
Chandragupta, go to Her Majesty Mura.
We will capture him.
- Go!
- Okay, Acharya.
Let us get out of here, Your Majesty.
Right now we should get out
of here and merge with the other army.
It seems like defeating
Mura is impossible.
No! No, Amatya.
Do you know the greatest
weakness of prideful people?
Their desire to live and
love is their greatest weakness.
My greatest strength is that victory
holds the absolute value for me.
No life holds any value before that.
I get it, Your Majesty.
I will be ready for your signal.
Mansa!
I knew it..
I knew you are capable
of trickeries only, Dhananand.
The victors write the history, Mura.
Trickery for you
will be called my strength
by the history.
Mother!
Look at the vine on the tree.
It has become toxic.
But cutting the toxic
vine is not enough.
It is because it will
grow again and prove fatal
to the existence of the tree.
Hence, to protect the tree, completely
destroying the vine is important.
In human's life,
sickness, debts and enemies are like
this toxic vine.
Completely destroying
them is important.
Or else they will grow
and prove fatal for your future.
My ethics..
Your destiny.
I am giving you one last opportunity.
What is the secret of Dhananand?
Something of the sort
that if Tarini comes to know it
then her love towards Dhananand
will turn into hatred.
Such a hatred which she wouldn't
have done with anyone.

================================================================================

Episode: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dz_yAq6xhfM

Your Highness, let us get out of here!
Anyway, you have won and it
is impossible for Mura to stay alive!
Let us go!
Mother! Mother!
M-Mother.. What happened, Mother?
Tell me, Chandra.
Y-You have..
Freed our native land, right?
Tell me, Chandra.
Chandra.. Our native land..
W-We have won Piplivan, right?
Tell me, Chandra.
Yes, Mother.
We won.
Let us go, Chandra.
Take me home, Chandra.
I-I want to witness
the flag of victory
hosted on the palace of Piplivan,
Chandra.
- Take me home.
- Yes, Mother.
His Highness lost the battle.
I heard that Chandragupta
has acquired Piplivan.
But His Highness brought
a captive with him.
Come on.
What has happened?
Bring our flag, Stul.
You have done it, Chandra.
Today, you have passed
the tests of both
your mother and your motherland,
Chandra.
I have been waiting
for this moment from years.
That is why I was alive.
You have brought me
to the same land again
where everything started.
This was the place where
Dhananand took my land
my people, my husband
and my son away from me.
Mother!
A-And today..
Today, you have
returned all that to me, Chandra.
Now, I can die peacefully.
No, Mother!
Mother!
H-How can you leave
your Chandra behind?
Mother, you promised me
that when we will win
the battle of Piplivan
then you will prepare
that special 'kheer' for me
which you used to prepare
for me during my childhood.
You promised, right, Mother?
Mother, I kept my promise.
It is your turn.
Keep your promise, Mother.
How can you go after coming
so close to united India?
The dream that we all saw together.
How can you go without fulfilling it?
How can you leave me, Mother?
Who said that I am leaving you?
I-I am not leaving you, Chandra.
I am here, with you.
I will be like the energy
flowing in your veins.
I will keep supporting you.
And you should move
forward without stopping.
Chandra, you should ensure
Chandra, you should ensure
that the flag which is
waving in the palace of Piplivan
should wave in the whole Bharat too.
That is when we will get
one nation, one king.
This is your destiny.
You should become the first emperor
- of the united Bharat.
- Mother..
I know that Dhananand
wants to finish us.
He is a fool.
He is planning to finish a danger
from which he should
actually run away.
He is foolish.
And now, I can
- die peacefully.
- No, Mother.
I know that you will take revenge
for the oppressions
caused on your mother
and on your motherland.
You will do it, will you not?
Chandra, promise me.
You will become an emperor,
will you not?
Promise me that you will
lay foundation to a new Bharat.
That you will carry
on your perseverance
to bring peace and development.
That you will prioritise
your motherland above anything
so that the future generations
does not follow what
that wicked Dhananand did.
So that no mother ever
gets separated from her son.
Promise me..
Promise me..
Mother, I promise you
for as long as I am alive
I will fulfill every duty of mine towards
my motherland with all dedication.
In the shadow of the Maurya family
I will form a kingdom
where our motherland
and all its mothers
will be free from all the oppressions.
This is my promise to you.
I pray that every mother
gets a son like you, Chandra.
I have one last desire.
Please bury me beside
your father's grave.
I want to go to him.
I sacrifice myself
for the sake of Piplivan.
Mother..
Mother!
Mother..
Dhananand, you had promised me
that you would stop shedding blood.
Does your word have no value?
Was your promise a lie?
I am following everything
that I said to you, Tara.
But this poison maiden betrayed me.
If she had not joined
hands with Chandragupta
then that cunning Brahmin,
Chanakya, and Chandragupta
would have been dead.
I would have ruled Piplivan.
This is not bloodshed.
This is royal justice.
Moreover, it is necessary to end
all those who become
an obstacle to Magadh's goal.
Now, my subjects will witness
the consequences of betraying me!
Dhananand, I will not let you do this.
You are not as bad as
the world thinks you to be.
You are right, Tara.
I am not as bad as people think.
I am worse.
Soldiers!
Do you remember?
I had told you that if you
do not live up to my expectations
I would kill you mercilessly.
You are a poison maiden, are you not?
Now, I will put an end
to your poisonous life
by burning you alive
in the fire of this pyre.
'Mother.'
'What happened, Mother-in-law?'
'You have addressed me
like this for the first time.'
Once upon a time
this bracelet was a symbol
of my hatred towards you.
I used to think
that you had sold me, Mother.
But from now,
to the time I breathe my last
I will keep it with me.
It will become the
source of my energy.
It will become my motivation
and the symbol of your blessing.
Listen to me, Dhananand. Do not do it.
Dhananand!
Every traitor of Magadh
will die in front of me!
If this poison maiden had
not betrayed me then instead of her
Chanakya and
Chandragupta's dead bodies
would have been lying here.
Acharya..
Let us go, Chandra.
Let us go to your father's
final resting place
and fulfill Lady Mura's..
Let us fulfill Lady Mura's last wish.
- 'I can help you!
- Any important information?'
'There is a secret about
Dhananand which is known to no one'
'other than him and his brothers.'
Not now, Stulbhadra.
Before that, I have
to do something else.
I am giving you the last chance.
What is Dhananand's secret?
It is something that will
convert Tarini's love for him
into hatred.
Such hatred that he
never did with anyone else.
No matter how much I try
but this book cannot
be carried in this bag.
It is because this book
is bigger than the bag.
But this is not the
fault of this book.
It is the bag's fault.
I need a bigger bag.
In the same way,
if the level of our desires and dream
is bigger than our financial
and societal status
then our desires and
dreams are not at fault.
Instead of lessening them
we should increase our hard work.
Do remember.
The higher your desires are
you need to put in more
efforts to fulfill them.
My ethics..
Your destiny.
Have food.
My father taught me that
when someone dies in the house
then food is not cooked on that day.
Are you mourning the death of Mansa?
Not of Mansa but I am
mourning your death.

================================================================================

Episode: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=840Sn7wUji4

Sire, pardon me for saying so
but both of your brothers
have stepped back in the war.
Nobody knows where they are.
This can also be a betrayal.
But how can you be so relaxed
in spite of knowing this truth?
Because Amatya,
all my worries are now gone.
Had they not done that
I would have been
in a notion that they
consider me family and
they respect me for being a king.
But their behaviour proved
that they were never mine.
Now I can focus everything
on one person
who actually loves me.
My Tara..
I apologise for ruining
this feeling of you.
Queen Tara has denied having food.
Did you tell her that
if she doesn't have food
her face will become less radiant?
I tried my best to explain her..
But you must have not told
her that if she does not eat
nobody in Magadh will eat either.
Nobody will have food.
No, sire.
Then go, Amatya.
Tell this to your queen.
As you command, sire.
Tara, I knew that my words would work.
Have your meal.
My father
that is, your guru has taught me
that when someone dies at home
we do not cook food for a day.
So, will you mourn for
the death of Mansa, the traitor
who betrayed me?
No, Dhananand.
This is not for Mansi.
I am mourning for your death.
Yes, Dhananand, you heard it right.
I am mourning your death.
Because you are dead.
You neither have love
nor you have mercy.
You have no regret
even after committing a murder.
You are filled with only two feelings.
Hatred and adamance.
Those are the feelings
which keep you alive.
Hatred for Chandragupta
and adamance to become
the great king of Bharat.
I thought both of us
will start our lives anew
which is free from
hatred and bloodshed.
But it is good that
you broke my notion soon.
What is before me
today is your reality.
Stop, Tara!
Chandra, this place
is detached from the world.
I thought we are getting
ready to attack Magadh.
Why have we come here?
So far, we have killed
three brothers of Dhananand
and have abducted one.
That means, the four pillars
of Dhananand's kingdom have collapsed.
But before attacking Magadh
we should bring down the
most powerful pillar of Dhananand
who is also his right hand.
Do you mean to say that we
are going to kill Amatya Rakshas?
No, Sthulbhadra.
Even in war
we should never destroy
these four things.
Money, crops, wealth
and knowledge.
Amatya Rakshas is a learned man.
We should not destroy knowledge
but bring it in our favour.
I know that Amatya Rakshas's
senses are now dominated
by his loyalty.
Until it does not change
into his patriotism
we will confine him.
We will never kill Amatya Rakshas.
But how will we even abduct him?
He stays with Dhananand
all the time like his shadow.
You will know that soon, Stul.
Before that, tell me something.
Did you pass on that
message to Tarini?
Yes, Chandra,
everything is going as per your plan.
Okay.
Acharya, let us proceed.
Are you Tarini's mother?
Considering the way
you came out of the room
I thought that you are ready to leave.
No, Dhananand.
I am not going anywhere.
I will be with you here.
I am pleased to hear that.
But what is your motive?
Because I can clearly see in your eyes
that you are here not for your love
but for your hatred towards me.
Yes.
All I have for you is hatred.
But this hatred is for myself too.
Because I trusted your words again.
I hate myself
for forgetting my father's teachings.
That is why I will stay here.
I will be with you and punish myself.
I want to see to
what level you can stoop
to break my belief.
Look, Tara,
I am ready to go as per your guidance.
But I cannot ignore traitors
like Mansa for that.
She has killed my brother, Bhutapala.
If I do not punish her
my people will think that I am
sympathetic towards the traitors.
There will be anarchy in the kingdom.
Everything will collapse.
People will start disobeying me.
Do you want that?
I have promised you
that I will spare the lives
of Chanakya and Chandragupta.
I will make sure that
I will fulfill this promise.
You can see it for yourself.
I have accepted my
defeat over Piplivan.
This is because I have promised you.
The promise you do not believe in
is what has held me until now.
Look into my eyes and tell me.
Does my promise not have any value?
If you want me
to mourn the death of Mansa,
the traitor
I will do that.
But whatever I am doing now
is just my duty towards my kingdom
and nothing else.
Pardon me, sire.
But I have an important message.
Give it to me.
It is not for you, sire.
It is for Queen Tara from her mother.
'Mother would never send
me a message in this palace.'
'She knows that every
message is scrutinised here.'
'That means, Chandragupta has sent
this message in the name of mother.'
What happened, Tara?
My mother is unwell.
I must leave today.
- Amatya.
- Yes?
Get the chariot ready.
We will embark soon.
- Sure, sire.
- No.
I must go there alone.
Tara, your mother is
now like a mother to me.
Both of us should go there.
No! This is not right.
I thought you told her
that we know of the betrayal.
But you have called her right here!
You invited her here!
How can you forgive the one
due to whom our mother..
Mother had taught me, Stul..
It is these feelings
that hinder us from acting.
The same happened with Tarini.
Her feelings towards
Dhananand stopper her
from making the right decision.
Driven by one of her mistakes
we cannot forget the
other sacrifices she made.
We must give another chance to Tarini.
And what if her
feelings stop her again?
She will not do so, this time.
I do not agree with you.
Just wait and watch!
She will not come alone
and she will bring Dhananand with her.
What are you doing?
Chandra,
you can be generous and forgiving
but I am not.
I will be alert and prepared.
So that she cannot harm us again.
Leave me be.
Do not worry, Tara.
We shall reach soon.
Did you see that?
I told you!
She is not here alone.
She has brought Dhananand with her!
She has betrayed us again.
We must leave at once. Come on!
We will not leave, Stul.
This is Tarini's first test.
We have to see if
she brings Dhananand here
or if she comes alone.
Chandra, this is no game.
Dhananand will reach
here at any moment.
Acharya, talk some sense into him.
Stulbhadra!
It is Chandra's decision.
And I will not question his decision.
Stop the chariot.
Dhananand.
I understand your
concern for my mother
and your eagerness to meet her.
And I see that you are her son-in-law
and you have a right to see her.
But you know that
she does not like you.
She would not be
pleased by your arrival.
Tara, these things do not matter now.
Our bond needs a new beginning
- and I am ready for it.
- Not yet.
Mother is sick and frail for now.
I do not want her to worry.
So I think it would be better for me
to go alone from here.
Then so be it.
If that is what you want.
I shall wait for you over here.
Where is Queen Mura?
I wish to speak in her presence.
Where is she?
Mansa was not the only one
that sacrificed her life
due to the betrayal, Tarini.
What?
Yes, Tarini.
Mother
has attained warrior's heaven.
It is all because of me.
Take this and kill me!
This is what I deserve!
Queen Mura and Mansa
died due to my betrayal
and I must have informed you
that Dhananand marches from south.
I beg you!
Kill me, Chandra! Kill me.
This is what I deserve.
Keep the dagger with you, Tarini.
We have not called
you here to punish you.
We have called you here
so that you can mend your way
and help us in the revolution.
No, Chandragupta.
I am not worthy of helping you.
I had thought that by my pure love
I will cleanse
Dhananand's vile nature.
But I was wrong.
It was due to my mistake
and now Queen Mura and Mansa re dead.
A wrong decision of mine
has cost this revolution
two brave women.
Who were way more worthy
and reliable than me.
And their sacrifice
must not be tainted by my betrayal.
Tarini, there is
exploitation in the world
not because the weak
cannot raise their voice.
It happens
because the strong and mighty
simply watch as spectators.
If you wish to help us
many of the sacrifices
made will not be in vain.
But if you were to
stay as a mere spectator
against this inhuman slaughter
then Queen Mura and
Mansa and countless others
would have died in vain!
`But Acharya..
I do not think I can help you
fight against Dhananand.
You cannot go against him Tarini
since you do not know
what he took from you.
Something that he did to me as well.
What is it?
What did he take from me?
He has always been loving towards me.
I may have spewed venom against him
but he has never been harsh with me.
So that makes it difficult
for me to fight against him.
He never did any harm to me.
He never took anything from me.
There is a truth
that he kept from you for years.
As he knows that you
would not even see him
if you knew of the truth.
Let alone loving him.
It is time that you
know about that truth.
What is it?
Tarini.
Dhananand was the one
who killed your father.
What?
A steed is times stronger than a man
and yet a simple leash
makes a man bend
the steed to his will.
And hence no matter the skill you have
but if you do not hold
the reins of your life
and someone else does
then they will make you walk the path
that brings them a great gain.
So remember this well.
If you wish to succeed in your life
then do not let others
control you, in life.
My ethics..
Your destiny.
This is not possible.
Dhananand is cruel.
But he cannot murder
his Tarini's father.
This is true, Tarini.
Dhananand has murdered your father.

================================================================================

Episode: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C11l5DzwLgU

Tarini.
Dhananand is your father's murderer.
What!
This is true, Tarini.
Dhananand has murdered your father.
No.
This is not possible.
My father died in this
house in front of me.
T-There were some
wounds on his stomach
due to which he passed away.
Dhananand is cruel.
But he cannot murder
his Tarini's father.
This is true, Tarini.
Dhananand has murdered your father.
Dhananand killed
your father in such a way
that you would believe
that he died a natural death.
But all of us knew about this truth.
'Your training has been completed,
Dhananand.'
'According to the custom'
'you will have to give me
the gift for a guru.'
'A renowned scholar Brahmin like you'
'has shared your knowledge
with an ordinary barber like me.'
'You made me your disciple.'
'You have expanded
my path of becoming'
'the king of Magadh in future,
Gurudev.'
'I will give you
whatever you ask me for.'
'Promise me, Dhananand'
'that you will forget Tara
from today.'
'You will go away from her life.'
'And you will never
return to her life.'
'I have seen great love
for you in Tara's eyes.'
'Being a guru,
I know you very well too.'
'No matter how many obstacles you face
in order to reach your destination'
'you will not see what
is right and what is wrong.'
'To become the strongest
and most powerful king of India'
'you can choose any path.'
'I know my daughter very well.'
'She will never be able
to tolerate immortality.'
'She will be unhappy
with your behaviour.'
'She will be shattered.'
'Being a father'
'I would never want
to see my daughter sad.'
'I want to save her
from this problem.'
'So, Dhananand, promise me.'
'Can you make this promise?'
'Tell me, Dhananand.'
'Okay, Gurudev.'
'If this is what you want as a gift'
'I promise you'
'that I will go away from Tara'
'and I will never return to her life.'
'Okay, Dhananand.'
'This is the only promise
that I wanted from you.'
'I will make a move.'
'Gurudev.'
'How can you leave like this?'
'Today is an important day for me.'
'So, I want to serve you today.'
'Please give me permission
to feed you with my hands.'
'Leave the palace after that.'
The kitchen duty
was mine at that time.
On Dhananand's say
I had mixed slow poison
in your father's food.
That poison was prepared
by Dhananand himself.
He knew that your father
would be going home
from the palace.
So, he fed him that poison
so that its affect begins
after he reaches home
and he loses his life in front of you.
You will never get a
doubt that he was murdered
and Dhananand is responsible for that.
'Father.'
'Father, what happened?
You seem to be unwell.'
'My stomach is aching.'
'Sit.'
'I will get water.'
'Take this, Father.'
'Father!'
Forgive me, Tarini.
I did everything on Dhananand's say.
No.
Do not kill me.
You know Dhananand.
I did not mix poison
in your father's food.
I was helpless. I am telling
you the truth. I was helpless.
Please let me go. Forgive me.
Forgive me.
Tarini, thank you very
much for forgiving me.
Thank you very much
for giving me life.
I will go away from Magadh.
Nobody will know
what has happened here.
I promise you this.
This is the pain of betrayal,
Pandugati.
This is your punishment
for betraying my father and your guru.
Two brothers of
Dhananand are alive now.
Now, I am completely ready to help you
in killing them and Dhananand.
What is taking Tara so long?
Your Majesty,
I will go and check right now
whether everything
is all right or not.
No, Amatya Rakshas.
After Mansa's death,
Tara and my relationship
is going through many problems.
She knows that you are suspecting her
even after our wedding.
I am sorry, Your Majesty.
- But I am doing this for you.
- I know, Amatya.
But I do not want to give
Tara any chance to get angry again.
She may get more
angry if you go there.
I will only go and check.
What happened, Tara?
Is everything all right?
Yes, everything is all right.
Mother is sleeping.
We should go now.
What is this blood on your clothes?
Are you injured?
I cannot see any wound.
'This is the truth Tarini
that Dhananand killed your father.'
'Dhananand killed your father
in such a way'
'that you would believe that
he died a natural death.'
Some wounds are not visible,
Dhananand.
What do you mean?
Mother's lungs are
damaged due to the disease.
Blood flows from her nose sometimes.
I hope she gets better soon.
Even I hope she gets better soon
because you become worried
when she is not well
and I cannot see you worried, Tarini.
Dhananand,
I know how concerned you are about me.
Shall we go?
'These bloodstains do not seem to
be of the blood flown from the nose.'
'Undoubtedly,
Tarini is hiding something.'
'I will have to find out.'
Why have you brought me here, Tara?
Dhananand, I want to see
how loyal you are towards the
promise that you have given to me.
Will you sacrifice this
life filled with blood or not?
And I have heard
that this place holds
special importance to you.
Then tell me, Dhananand
who did you kill with this poison?
I had killed a king with this.
Because he dared to go
against me and challenge me.
But now
I have no need of this.
Because no king would
go against me now.
I had killed a Brahmin with this
because he refused to be
a part of my board of ministers.
Just because I was
born in a different caste.
'Great! He drank the potion! Great!'
'Using poisonous plants and serpents'
'I made that potion especially
to kill you, Chanakya.'
I gave this to that Chanakya
but that cunning Brahmin
digested even this.
And this one?
Who did you kill with this?
What are you doing, Chandra?
I want a statue of mother.
But I cannot even select
a picture of her for it.
What kind of a son am I?
I cannot even honour
her heritage properly.
There is only one way
to do justice to the heritage
of a great woman like your mother.
By following her ideals.
Lady Mura was kindness
and forgiveness incarnate.
And I know one thing about you.
Despite being a hard man and a warrior
you have kindness and
compassion in your heart.
And you got this from your mother.
Her heritage already
lives in your character.
And an example of that is
giving another chance to Tarini.
Durdhara, you always say something
that gives me my confidence back.
You are not just my wife
you are my strength.
It is my good fortune and pride
to be the strength of someone
who carries the
responsibility of whole India.
Besides, you have the
blessings of your parents
to give you strength.
They watch over you, every moment.
And not just theirs,
you have the blessings
of every parent in India
whose children you will free
from the shackles
of tyrannical rulers.
They will never have to live
the life of slavery that you lived.
Only because of you.
If you are with me
I will build an India
where every child
will live freely.
Mother's this picture
will always remind
us of her intentions.
Undoubtedly.
Tell me, Dhananand.
Tell me who you killed
with this poison.
Tara, I know that all
my promises seem empty to you
and everything I say a lie.
Do this.
Give this poison to me.
If a husband and wife
cannot trust each other
what is the point
of that relationship?
Let me drink it. Give me this poison.
Give it to me.
Give it to me.
Trust me, Tara.
I will keep every promise I made.
I will not do anything that hurts you.
There is something
that is disturbing you.
I can see it clearly
in your eyes, Tara.
Tell me, what is the matter?
M-My mother.. After father's death
she is the only one I have.
I want to do something for her.
Will you help me?
I will do what you say, Tara.
'Get ready, Amatya.'
'Soon you will be forced
to leave your king.'
This sword and this spear
both weapons are capable
of killing an enemy.
The only difference is that
the sword stays close to you
and ends the enemy
whereas the spear goes away
from you to finish you enemy.
The way of using both
the weapons is different
but both are necessary in a war.
The same way
in life too along with the wisdom
to find solutions
to problems close to you
it is also important to plan
for the problems you
have to face in future.
Otherwise, a problem will trap you
while you are solving another problem.
My ethics..
Your destiny.
Stul, our plan is to imprison
Amatya Rakshas only.
There is an important reason
to hold him captive.
By separating Amatya from Dhananand
Dhananand will become
helpless and unreceptive.

================================================================================

Episode: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXH00Tpn_fY

Do not worry.
I will see that no harm comes to you.
I trust you.
That is why, I have come here.
Be alert!
Amatya is coming this way.
According to the plan,
we should split. Hurry.
Old woman!
Look, what you did!
You should walk carefully.
'She is the mother of Tarini..'
'She was not even able to get up.'
'Then, how did she come here?'
'So, Tarini lied that
her mother was not well.'
'I have to find out.'
Soldiers! Arrest her!
Go!
Get hold of that woman!
Stop! It is the order of Amatya
that no one should leave this place.
Listen!
Come with me.
Tara..
The conspiracy which you
are hatching against the king..
I will not let that succeed.
Never!
Your Highness.
I was coming to see you.
Tell me, Mahamatya.
I want to tell you something
important, Your Highness..
Only to you.
Mahamatya,
on earlier instances, I have told you
that you can say anything
in front of the queen.
As you wish, Your Highness.
This matter concerns
the mother of the Queen.
The way the queen describes
the illness of her mother
that is not true.
What are you trying to say, Amatya?
Do you want to say that my mother
and I are pretending her to be ill?
Are you accusing that the blood of
my mother on my clothes are fake?
Mahamatya!
Apologise to the queen,
at this very moment.
I can punish you
for giving her anxiety.
Forgive me.
I did not know that
you will misunderstand me.
Your Highness, what I meant was..
Her mother is not that weak,
the way she is thinking.
She can receive treatment.
I have found an experienced physician
who can treat the mother of the queen.
Tara, did you hear that?
Everybody in this palace
are your well-wishers.
But Mahamatya, Tara is in the notion
that more than the medicines
her mother needs prayers.
I want to hold 51 day veneration
for my mother.
And during that period of veneration
I will be at the temple.
She is right, Mahamatya.
Even I will take
part in this veneration.
Please accept my gratitude, boy.
For a common person like me,
you risked your life.
Amatya could have seen you.
Even you and your daughter Tarini
are risking your lives
to help us in this battle.
So, it is my duty to protect you.
Moreover, in this world
nothing is more valuable
than one's mother.
But Chandragupta
I am not able to apprehend
this complex plan of you and Acharya.
How will we trap Amatya?
When Amatya saw that
the mother of Tarini
is hale and hearty his suspicious
will grow more strong.
And after that, when Tarini announces
the veneration for a span of 51 days
the suspicion of Amatya Rakshas
will become more strong.
And then, an intelligent
person like Amatya Rakshas
will definitely try
to strategise a plan.
And by using his intelligence
he will gradually fall in our trap.
Amazing!
This plan is beyond excellence.
I am dying to see
Amatya in the dungeons!
When we were children his atrocities
on us were unspeakable.
I will make sure to
take my revenge on him!
Stulbhadra..
Our plan is to imprison
Amatya Rakshas only.
There is an important
reason to hold him captive.
By separating Amatya from Dhananand
Dhananand will become
helpless and unreceptive.
Nobody will be there to guide him.
In this way..
In this way, we will already
win half of the battle.
What happened?
Is there any problem?
No, Your Highness.
There is no problem.
I was thinking that if the
Her Highness gives me the permission
then, I would organise
and arrange the veneration.
This will get you some time
to take up your political works
and queen
will be able to meet
her mother any time.
Good! Very good, Amatya!
This is why you are my valuable asset.
You have a solution to every problem.
Tara, what do you say?
I think this is right.
Amatya will handle all the
preparations of the great penance.
All right.
I think Amatya can
facilitate this penance.
Thank you very much, Queen Tara.
Stop!
Pardon me saying this, Amatya
but as per the direction of the king
we have to visit the temple
of the queen's family deity
in order to fulfill the penance.
But this is the house
of the queen's mother.
That is where we are going.
Welcome! We were waiting for you.
Proceed and surround this hut.
Tara, I have come to know your truth.
I am sure you used to
come here to meet someone
in the pretext of
visiting your sick mother.
I am sure that you have
teamed up with Chandragupta.
I will make sure I find your mother
and reveal your truth to the king.
This is Magadh's royal ring.
It is the king and his brothers
who wear this exclusively.
Pandugati is missing.
That means
Pandugati was confined here.
So, Vishnugupta,
this was all your conspiracy.
Come and kill me. Kill me.
Amatya Rakshas,
you are indeed a scholar.
But you could not understand
something as simple as this
that it is your king
who killed scholars
and not mine.
Amatya Rakshas, do you remember this?
The first time I visited Magadh,
to meet Dhananand
with my request
I made an offer to you too.
'Amatya Rakshas,
when there's a doubt in your mind'
'even the weapon in
your hand is of no use.'
'This is no time for such foolishness,
but to take a decision.'
'Whose Minister are you?'
'Magadh Kingdom
or that arrogant Dhananand?'
I give you the same offer again.
It is not too late yet.
You can still support
what is righteous
in this battle against the evil.
Neither your offer has changed
nor will my answer.
For as long as I am alive
I will be loyal to Magadh
and its emperor, Dhananand.
Just tell me what you did
with his brother, Pandugati.
I am sure that you have abducted him.
Tell me, where have you kept him?
You must have understood by now
who killed Pandugati.
'What are these bloodstains
on your clothes?'
'Mother's lungs are damaged.'
'Blood flows from her nose sometimes.'
Tarini.
How dare you plot
against my king?
You played with his emotions.
I will not leave all of you alive.
I will not spare you.
If you were equally angry
about Dhananand's torture
on every citizen of India
and if you had displayed
the same anger then, Amatya Rakshas
you would not be in prison today.
I know your answer, Amatya Rakshas.
Listen to my response now.
You will be in this prison
and you will see the domination
and every pillar of your king falling.
Yes, Amatya Rakshas.
You will become a witness
to Dhananand's downfall
by staying in this prison.
And you will not be able
to do anything else either.
The pillars of Magadh are not so weak,
Vishnugupta
that you can destroy it.
Think once again, Amatya.
I think you are forgetting
that we have destroyed four pillars
of Dhananand's kingdom.
Bhutapala.
Rashtrapal.
Dashasiddhika.
And now Pandugati.
Only Pandu, Kaivarta
and you are left.
I am sorry.
You have already been held captive.
Acharya, your plan has
separated Amatya from Dhananand.
Tarini will carry on our war
for justice without any obstacles.
Amatya, you still have time.
Take the right decision.
Think about joining hands with us
because nobody knows
for how many more days
Dhananand will remain alive.
No!
'This is the truth Tarini
that Dhananand killed your father.'
'Dhananand killed your father
in such a way'
'that you would believe
that he died a natural death.'
'Father, take this.'
'Father..'
'Dhananand, you had killed
my father with same poison.'
'Now, I will use
the same poison on you.'
When a farmer sows seeds in his field
why does he sow only
one kind of seeds?
Why does he not sow
different kinds of seeds?
He does that so that
he can concentrate
only on growing one kind of crop
and get the best result from it.
We should follow the
same principle in life too.
Instead of choosing different goals
we should choose only one goal.
And we should spend
all our time and effort
in achieving that one goal.
That is when you can get the most
and best result in a short span.
My ethics..
Your destiny.
'Dhananand, I tried to get
you on the right path with my love.'
'But I was unsuccessful.'

Tara.
'Chandragupta,
I wanted to kill Dhananand'
'but I did not take that step..'
'Not because I still love him.'
'It is because you made me realise'
'that a person should not take
a decision out of impulsion.'
'If you had made me kill Dhananand'
'then, you could have
given me that responsibility'
'when I had entered that
palace as your informer.'
'But you did not take that step.'
'And today,
I understood the actual reason of it.'
'So, do not worry.'
'I will do my duty
according to the plan.'
She should have killed Dhananand!
The entire chapter would
have ended once and for all.
No, Stulbhadra.
Tarini took the right step.
If she had killed
Dhananand deceptively
then, there would have been no
difference between Dhananand and us.
Stulbhadra,
do not forget that this battle
will not be fought
only between the two armies
but also between two ideologies.
For that, it is important to shatter
the anarchical ideology of Dhananand.
And this will only be possible
when Chandragupta breaks his ego
and dethrones him.
Only then, Dhananand
will be completely destroyed.
Acharya is absolutely right.
When the time is right
I will kill that cruel Dhananand.
Both of you are right.
I..
I got carried away.
But what about the coins?
Will we ever get them back?
In this way, we will be wasting
a huge amount of
wealth on our enemies.
Who knows if the greed of Pandu
will be quenched with
this huge wealth or not.
No need to worry about that,
Stulbhadra.
He will be getting back
double the amount which
we are handing over to him.
You only have to make sure
that these coins should be
hauled in the cart which
has wealth of the treasurer.
Now, we will strike Dhananand
with double the power.
Your Highness, the tax has been
collected from the subjects.
The cart full of wealth
will be coming in any moment.
That work is also important.
Your presence there is very important.
Brother, you carry on with you work.
I urgently need to be somewhere.
As you wish, Brother.
I had told you
that because of my wife
I had to destroy all my poison.
That is why, I had told you
to secretly collect the poison.
But I do not see anything here.
Where is my poison?
I want the most lethal
poison for my sword
so that I can kill
those who rise against me!
Pardon me, Your Highness.
I sought every way
to accumulate the poison
but I was helpless.
I even went to the library
but I could not conjure any poison.
In fact, the librarian gave the reason
that they have no means of
putting the poison on the weapons.
Leave!
Never it happened in Magadh
that there is no poison
to be applied to the weapons.
Definitely, that crooked Chanakya
and Chandragupta are behind this.
But very soon, I will find out
what new planning that
imbecile has in mind.
Stul!
Do you have any information
regarding the gift
we sent to Pandu?
Or has the poison girl
delivered any message to you?
No, Chandra.
We have not received
any message until now.
Chandra, this message
is from the poison girls.
But how do they know that
we are going to use these bamboos?
This is the uniqueness of
such a strong spy-system, Stulbhadra.
Everything happens
with amazing coordination.
You are right.
Chandra, our gift has
reached Magadh's treasury.
Good!
Everything is happening
according to our plan.
Our next goal is Pandu.
This is the only task
that I greatly enjoy doing
by staying under Dhananand.
Because only at this time, I get
to be around so much wealth.
'Piplivan's emblem.'
'I am sure this is
Chandragupta's conspiracy.'
Pandugati!
Such a precise attack on the neck!
I am sure someone must
have done it impulsively.
Chandragupta has not slayed him.
Because I have this much
information about my enemies.
What do you think, Tara?
Who could it be who
hates my brother so much
that despite making him a prisoner
for so many days killed him
so mercilessly?
What harm could my
brother have done to him?
I am sure a dear
one must be behind this.
A family member, right?
This game of violence
is like the double-edged sword.
If your strike ends up killing someone
even you cannot escape
the sharp edge of that sword.
You always make the right point
at the right time.
This was the reason I asked
you this question because I want
to make you understand
that I am not making any mistake
by thirsting for Chanakya
and Chandragupta's blood.
Because those two
are thirsty for my blood
and its proof is my brothers
getting slayed one after
the other mercilessly.
So
I have no option left.
So, from today onwards
I break all my promises.
Brother Kaivarta, come with me.
'If I had any feelings left for you'
'I would have surely
got scared of your question.'
'My hate towards you
has made me so strong'
'that I looked into
your eyes and lied.'
Brother, put your hand
into this snake hole.
Forgive me, Your Majesty.
I know that I failed in my task as
the head of the kingdom's security.
That is why our brothers
got killed one after the other.
But I will set things right soon,
Your Majesty.
Trust me, Your Majesty.
- I promise you.
- Are you done?
Put your hand inside now.
What happened?
Was the snake not inside the hole?
No, Your Majesty.
Oh! That is very bad.
Put your hand inside this hole.
What happened?
Was the snake not inside this too?
This is also empty, Your Majesty.
Oh!
Put your hand inside this hole.
All the holes are empty, Your Majesty.
So, you did not bring
me here to kill me.
Brother, among all my brothers
only you and Brother Pandu are alive.
And when I know that
Chandragupta and Chanakya
can target you I will never kill you
and make their work easier.
In this situation both the
brothers are very important for me.
Thank you, Your Majesty.
But I am not able
to understand one thing.
How are all the holes empty and
where did all the poisonous snakes go?
You have spoken like
an intelligent man now.
These poisonous snakes leaving Magadh
is not a coincidence.
This is definitely
a plan of our enemies.
I did not understand, Your Majesty.
Chandragupta and Chanakya.
They are using our weapons against us.
First, they made the 'Vishkanya' Mansa
sent by us against us.
Now, the snakes have
disappeared all of a sudden.
This means,
they have formed a huge army
of 'Vishkanyas' against us.
Yes. That is not the end.
Our Bhutapala being
killed by that 'Vishkanya'
was a part of their plan
through which they
wanted to get the book
of the informer's network.
This means
that their army of 'Vishkanyas'
have spread in our kingdom
and they are getting
all our information.
What is the order for me now,
Your Majesty?
Now that I have given
you all the information
my dear brother
go and find Chandragupta
and Chanakya's army of 'Vishkanyas'
and kill them.
Brother, if you fail to do this
you will be of no use to me.
This means, I will kill you.
We will get rid of
Pandu before sunrise.
Till then, for our next plan we will
have to get all the information
about Dhananand's army camp which is
located on the banks of River Ganga.
Kalindi, you will have
to be extra careful this time
because the goal is very difficult.
Do not worry about me, Acharya.
I am even ready to sacrifice
my life to reach my goal.
I and Kaivarta will be
Chandragupta's next targets.
Who?
Who is it there?
Come forth.
I said, come forth.
It is me.
I am sorry for coming
here at this time.
But I had come to mourn
your brother's death.
If you were really worried
about me and my brothers
you would not send Amatya
so far from the palace.
The security arrangement was disrupted
only due to the absence of Amatya.
He is the pillar of
this kingdom and you..
You are right.
Even I am feeling very guilty.
Look at this.
On one side,
Amatya is conducting a veneration
for my mother's long-life.
On the other hand
your brothers are getting killed.
Now, even I think
Amatya should have been here.
But Dhananand will not agree for this
if I talk to him.
If..
What if you bring Amatya here again
without informing Dhananand?
Do not talk like an idiot.
If I stop the veneration that is being
conducted for your dearest mother
Dhananand will kill me.
You are right.
So, even I will accompany you.
You too?
Yes, I have realised that I
will only have to rectify my mistake.
So, I will also accompany
you in bringing Amatya back.
And I will handle Dhananand too.
But we will have to
leave as soon as possible.
Let us go now then.
Chandra,
we have set the trap for Pandu
and the 'Vishkanyas' have
also been sent for our next plan.
Now.. What will we do next?
We will wait now
for our target to
come to us on his own.
You might have heard
that more beautiful
a peacock's fathers
the more ugly are its feet.
But when the same peacock dances
everyone looks at
its beautiful feathers
and not at its ugly feet.
That is because
a peacock looks at
his talent and capabilities
and not at its weakness.
We should also follow
the same principle in life.
We should identity our
weaknesses and shortcomings.
But we should
concentrate on our talent
and capabilities.
Remember this.
This world will value you
on the basis of how
you value yourself.
So, rate yourself first.
Raise yourself in your eyes.
That is when this world
will respect you
and praise your efforts.
My ethics..
Your destiny.
My enemies were taking
shelter in my kingdom
which I had never imagined.
But I have caught one of them.
Whoever betrayed me
will get death penalty.

================================================================================

Episode: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gXSLOUd9B0w

Save me! Somebody, save me!
Dhananand will kill me
if anything happens to her.
Save me.
Get ready!
Tarini is bringing Pandu here!
Save me!
Stulbhadra!
Who is it..
That is no use, Pandu.
Acharya, we have to admit something.
It was difficult to trap Amatya
but he very easily got caught by us.
- What?
- Yes, Pandu.
Do not be shocked by Amatya's capture
because your shield,
your protective cover
the brain of Magadh, Amatya Rakshas
is resting in the prison
of Piplivan right now.
His Majesty Chandragupta
has not given him death penalty
because he is a scholar and wise.
And his knowledge be of use
to us in the future.
But you..
What use can you be to us?
No. Chandragupta,
give him death penalty.
Please forgive me.
I will do as you say.
Just do not kill me.
I will tell you what?
Send a message to your
palace and summon your chariot.
We want to go for an trip.
You said that we will
get twice the amount of money
we give him.
But that does not seem to
happen while we are sitting here.
Stulbhadra,
whose chariot are we aboard right now?
Pandu's chariot.
And what is his post in the kingdom?
He is the chief of royal treasury.
He is the chief of royal treasury.
So where would his chariot go
so far away from the palace?
Oh, God!
Are you saying that
we are going to
Dhananand's dearest place?
Not just going there, Stulbhadra.
We are there.
How come you are here?
I am here on the orders of His Majesty
to examine the security of this place.
Open the path!
- But His Majesty..
- Are you going to question me now?
Open the path!
Why are you two so worried?
These people are prime
guards of Magadh's security.
What are they doing here, though?
Chandra,
you are worrying for no reason.
We have reached the
place we intended to.
I do not see anything to worry about.
No, Stulbhadra,
you are forgetting acharya's lessons.
Until we obtain the money
we have to be
dissatisfied and move on.
Dhananand might come
here at any moment.
Did His Majesty inquire
about me when I was absent?
Your Majesty,
His Majesty is not in the palace.
'Is Dhananand suspicious of me?'
'Where would he have
gone so late at night?'
'If I tell him the truth,
I will die by Chandragupta's hands.'
'If brother finds out the truth,
he will kill me as well.'
What happened, Stulbhadra?
Dhananand!
What are you doing here now,
Your Majesty?
After brother
Pandugati's death, I feel
my enemies are not killing my brothers
but taking down all my pillars.
I have to stop him
and save my brothers.
That is reason I am here.
Since you spend most of your time here
I decided I would inspect
the security of this place.
Chandragupta might you have
in his sights next.
Anyway, if that boy could put
my brother's corpse
in a bag of gold coins
and get to my royal treasury
his next target must be my wealth.
How does Dhananand sense
about our plans all the time?
Tell me, what are you doing here?
Yes.
I came here to inspect the security
of this place as well, Your Majesty.
With that intention in mind,
I brought great weapons
with me from Magadh's armoury
to strengthen the security here.
I do not believe your
words completely, Brother.
Many unpleasant incidents
have taken place before
but I have never seen
such devotion in you before
incidents take place.
I know, Your Majesty, that
I have disappointed on many occasions.
But my brothers would
do my part of work before.
Now only Kaivarta and
I remain in your service.
Hence, I have become
dedicated towards my duties.
Okay. So was this the only reason
you came here?
I have examined the
security of this place.
You can return to the palace now.
What happened?
I said, you can go to palace now.
Yes, Your Majesty.
Stop.
Let me inspect the weapons
you have brought.
Dhananand will find us!
'If Dhananand finds out
that I have brought his archenemy'
'Chandragupta and
Chanakya to his gold mine'
'he will kill me like Dashasidhiki.'
Forgive me, Your Majesty.
I drove this chariot.
If you inspect it
you will give out the signal
to soldiers that you do not respect me
and trust me anymore.
It will worsen my
reputation before them
and the soldiers and miners
will not follow my orders.
That will only make
it easier for enemies
to get past the
security of this place.
You are right.
I have not been behaving
well with you for some time.
Come on, let us return
to the palace together
and drink together!
Acharya, do something!
If you do not,
we will not capture the gold mine.
Instead, we will reach
the prison of Magadh.
A warrior who get impatient in battle
gets death and not victory.
Practice patience, Stulbhadra.
Come.
Your Majesty!
We have captured a 'Vishkanya'
of Chandragupta's group
at the banks of Ganges.
Brother Pandu,
stay here and protect this place.
And if there is any doubt
inform me immediately.
Let us go, Brother.
But the 'Vishkanyas'
has been trained in such a way
that it is impossible to catch them.
Then..
Acharya, this was your plan.
You intentionally sent the 'Vishkanyas'
to the banks of River Ganga
so that Dhananand's
mind gets distracted
and we can complete our task here.
Yes, Chandragupta.
But Dhananand will
not remain distracted
for a long time due
to the 'Vishkanyas'.
We will have to immediately
complete the task
for which we have come here.
Listen, I have brought
you to the mine on your say.
Now, do whatever you want to do.
But I am going from here.
Pandu, if you are really brave
prove it by going
back alive from here.
Traitor! Murderer!
Acharya, I think it is time for you
to pick up the weapon.
I am always ready, dear student.
'If Dhananand finds
out that I am a traitor'
'I will have to warn
Chandragupta immediately.'
'After Queen Mura and Mansa'
'I cannot put somebody else's
life in danger because of me.'
My enemies were taking
shelter in my kingdom
which I had never imagined.
But I have caught one of them.
She was thinking that she will escape.
But Dhananand's sight is the greatest.
She will get a death sentence.
No, let me go. Leave me.
I request you. I do not want to die.
Look at her, Tara.
This woman is a 'Vishkanya'.
It is clear from this that
Chandragupta and Chanakya
are eager to kill me.
And this woman is working
as their informer.
But she will also die just like Mansa.
Why? Mansa is your guru, right?
You will also burn
just how I had burnt her alive.
Have mercy on me, Your Majesty.
I did not even want
to become a 'Vishkanya'.
But I did not have any
other option at that point.
I will tell you everything.
I know all the plans of Chandragupta.
Grant me life, Your Majesty.
'Hurry up, Chandragupta.'
'Dhananand will soon find
out about your next plan.'
Look, I did as you said.
Let me go now.
Pandu, I think you have forgotten it.
But I remember everything.
I remember every moment of that day
when my friend,
Dhumketu, was killed because of you.
'I saw that servant,
Chandragupta's friend'
'going towards the washerman's
area a little while ago.'
'Dhumketu will get death
sentence with this blade.'
'I will not punish him, though.'
'You will kill him, Chandragupta.'
Today, I will take revenge
for every drop of blood
of Dhumketu.
You are greedy for this money, right?
Ever since you have
become Dhananand's treasurer
Dhananand and you have been looting
the hard earned money of the
people of Magadh in the name of taxes.
You have forced the helpless,
weak and handicapped people
to beg.
Due to your greed,
many people are homeless today.
But henceforth..
This will not happen henceforth.
Today, your sins will
come to an end, Pandu.
Today, this greed of yours
will become the reason of your death.
Look in all four directions.
Chandragupta and his
men will be somewhere around.
Surround this place.
My army kept checking
the place mentioned by you.
But they did not find Chanakya
or Chandragupta there.
Acharya was right.
Your hatred towards Chandragupta
will make you believe
the words of anybody
who says anything
against Chandragupta.
You have become blind in this hatred,
Dhananand.
'This means, this 'Vishkanya'
'was showing her loyalty
towards Chandragupta so far.'
'She played this game
to distract Dhananand.'
How dare you give wrong
information to the king?
I will..
Brother!
Act smartly sometimes at least.
I have not brought her here.
She has come here on her own.
She has pledged to sacrifice
her life for Chandragupta.
So, she is not scared of death.
Yes, I will not be sad about my death.
I will be sad only about the fact
that I will not be present
to watch your expression
when you receive the gift sent
by Acharya Chanakya and Chandragupta.
What gift?
Army of Magadh
you have tortured people
by making them servants in this mine
on the say of Dhananand.
But I will put an end
to this slavery today.
Look at him. Look at him.
He is Dhananand's brother
who had nothing apart from
greed and money in his life.
So, I will give him a gift today.
I will give him death through gold.
Dhumketu.
Dhumketu, Chandra has
taken revenge for your death.
There is an important similarity
between a soldier and a leader.
Just how the sword's handle
needs to be strong
for a powerful attack
even a leader needs
a good guide.
Somebody who can guide him
so that he does not do anything wrong
by get intoxicated
by strength and power.
Remember one thing.
Be it power or the sword
if it loses control
it can prove to be dangerous
for the one who owns it.
My ethics..
Your destiny.
This gold mine has been
a live example of slavery
torture, captivation
and greed for many years.
But henceforth,
this will became a place
where the gold found in this soil
will create a golden future
of our motherland.

================================================================================

Episode: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3x2vCEBP3Y

'Dhananand,
how did you like Acharya and my gift?'
'You must be wondering
why I chose this place'
'to send Pandu's body.'
'Because I want to
remind you something.'
'Many years ago,
our paths had crossed'
'with the theft of the
head of this golden statue.'
'You had cut Pandu's
finger for the same theft.'
'But you have no idea
that I am the one who stole'
'the head of this golden
statue amidst the celebration'
'of your birthday.'
'One chapter of the process
that began on that day'
'ends today with the death of Pandu.'
'And after looking
at Pandu's dead body today'
'you might have realised
where I killed him'
'and what new defeat you have got.'
'Yes, Dhananand.'
'The place which you
love the most in the world.'
'Your gold mine.'
Chandragupta!
This gold mine has been
a live example of slavery
torture, captivation
and greed for many years.
But henceforth
this will became a place
where the gold found in this soil
will create a golden
future of our motherland.
- Hail Chandragupta.
- All hail!
- Hail Maurya Kingdom.
- All hail!
- Hail Prince Chandragupta.
- All hail!
- Hail Maurya Kingdom.
- All hail!
I am sorry, Your Majesty.
But this information is right.
My informers have confirmed
that Chandragupta and his army
have established their
rule over the gold mine.
Also, they have blocked all
the roads that lead to that place.
Get the army ready immediately,
Brother.
The funeral pyre of the traitor who is
dreaming of conquering my gold mine
will burn there itself.
Yes, Your Majesty.
'I will have to stop
Dhananand for some time'
'so that I can warn
Chandragupta about this attack.'
Dhananand
Pandu's last rites have
not been performed yet.
This is not the time
to take a hasty decision.
You should..
My brother, Pandu's last rites
will definitely be performed, Tara.
But if I do this now
I will lose my kingdom
my people, my domination.
I want to look into the
eyes of my enemies and prove
that Magadh can still look
into the eyes of its enemies
and defeat them.
And this is what I am going to do.
I am going to show
that traitor his place.
Today, that cunning Brahmin,
Chanakya, will have to admit
that India has no
identity on this soil.
Magadh was always here,
Magadh is here
and Magadh will always be here.
Today, Magadh's sun will
burn that traitor into ashes
through its energy.
'If you were equally angry'
'about Dhananand's tortures
on the people on India'
'or if you had shown the same anger'
'you would not be locked
in this prison today.
'I know your answer, Amatya Rakshas.'
'Listen to my response now.'
'You will remain
locked in this prison'
'and see the downfall
of your king's domination'
'and the pillars of his kingdom.'
'To answer Dhananand's humiliation'
'Acharya had opened
his hair and pledged'
'that he will completely
destroy the Nand family.'
'Now, only three heirs'
'of the Nand family are alive.'
'Pandu! Kairavarta!'
'And Dhananand himself.'
'These heirs will also
be killed very soon.'
'When of these three torches go off'
'understand on your own,
Amatya Rakshas'
'that one more heir
of the Nand family'
'has breathed his last
at the hands of Chandragupta.'
Stop, Princess!
Whenever I have spoken
to you before this
I have looked down and spoken to you.
But today
I want to look into
your eyes and say something.
Did you not feel
ashamed to do everything
or for whatever you did?
A traitor like Chandragupta
deserves a death sentence.
But a traitor like you
should get a bigger punishment
than a death sentence.
Your brother, King Dhananand
did a lot for one smile of yours.
He united the earth,
sky and the ground.
And you returned
the favour of his love
through betrayal, Princess.
In return for his love,
it would be better
if you would die the
moment you were born.
He would not have to
witness this day at least.
He would not have to
tolerate this humiliation
that his sister is not with him
but with his greatest enemy,
Chandragupta
against her brother, King Dhananand.
Why?
What do you think, Amatya?
Is King Dhananand the
only one in this world
who is going through this sorrow
and this pain of betrayal?
No, Amatya.
Yes, it is true that he is the one
who always caused pain.
The circle of destiny
has made him sense this pain.
As far as my loyalty is concerned
I am standing with Chandra
in the path of truth and justice.
Remember my words, Princess.
History will always remember you
for your disloyalty
towards your brother
and not for your loyalty
towards Chandragupta.
Amatya Rakshas!
If loyalty and trust
was based on relationships
even Vibhishan would have
supported his brother, Ravan
and not Lord Ram.
It needs courage to
stand against our enemies.
But what needs more courage
is to go against our loved ones who
have lost the path of righteousness.
Durdhara has decided to
help what's true and righteous
instead of supporting her brother.
And the history will
remember this decision of her.
- Chandragupta!
- Before you say any word
you should know that the one
standing before you right now
is not the queen of Magadh
but the princess of Piplivan.
So, I cannot hear
even a word against her.
I request you to stay in your limits.
Hey!
Let me get out
of here just once.
I will finish you completely,
Chandragupta Maurya.
'I hope Chandragupta
and Acharya are ready'
'to face the next
attack of Dhananand.'
Stop, Tara.
I want you to do an
important work of mine.
Before I go to the war
I want my love, the queen of Magadh
and my wife to perform
the ritual prayer for me.
So that you can
welcome me the same way
when I return victorious.
You are the one only
one who can do this.
I am inspiring you
to stop the bloodshed
and you are asking me perform
the ritual with your blood
before you leave for the war.
Tara, you say that
blood should be shed in war.
There you go!
Tara, both of us know that my enemies
can do anything to kill me.
Now it depends on you
if you are with me or with them.
I will not force you to support me
but I will not let you stop me either.
I pray that through this war
you realise
that you become a great king
not by causing bloodshed
of the innocents
but by protecting your people
and progressing their life.
An able king
should consider love over bloodshed.
For as long as I am alive
I will not let King Dhananand
go in the war alone.
What do I do to get out of here?
What..
I need water.
I need water.
I cannot stop coughing. Hurry up!
Do not waste your energy, Amatya.
This lock is not going
to get opened from this key.
Because after whatever
happened between Durdhara and you
Chandra has handed
over the key of this lock
to Durdhara.
Anyway, you have nothing to do
after you come out of this cell.
Chandra and Acharya must have
already executed their next plan.
Acharya
I think we should have brought Stul
and some other soldiers with us.
Let they be where they are.
We must attack his base
situated by the River Ganga
before he fails our attack.
All right, Acharya.
Your Highness
we have got an information just now
that the our enemies have embarked
towards our base on
the bank of River Ganga.
Even Chandragupta has
left from the goldmine.
Even he is approaching
towards the same base.
This is the right
time for us to capture
our goldmines again.
I am surprised how you are still alive
among all my brothers.
And I am more surprised
that you still don't understand
the gravity of the situation.
Why do you not understand
that our matter of
worry is not the goldmine
but the wicked Chandragupta.
That goldmine will always remain mine.
I am missing my biggest advisor
and supporter, Amatya.
Go, bring him from wherever he is.
And if anyone comes in your way
eliminate him.
A boatman never takes any of
his boat related problems lightly.
If he finds a problem in his boat,
he fixes it immediately.
Because he knows
that even a small problem of the boat
can become the reason
for its sinking in the sea.
We should adapt this
quality of the boatman
when it comes to our health.
When we have some illness
we usually do not get
its treatment done on time.
If we do not treat a
health related problem on time
it can prove to be fatal
not only for ourselves
but for our family too.
Remember this.
Prevention is better than cure.
My ethics..
Your destiny.
By dusk tomorrow Dhananand
will have the barracks ready.
Then we shall make
our first move in the land of Magadh,
tomorrow night.
And we shall take
our next step in uniting
the great land of India.

Soldiers! Prepare yourselves!
Chandragupta! Stop!
We must leave from here at once!
Why should we, Acharya?
We have the upper hand!
We can easily capture these barracks.
Acharya, Dhananand is coming here.
We can end him now.
And we can capture
Magadh by the nightfall.
Chandragupta, do as I am telling you!
I will answer all
your questions later!
- Come with me!
- But Acharya..
To the boats!
Fall back! Fall back!
Hail Emperor Dhananand!
Hail Emperor Dhananand!
Hail Emperor Dhananand!
Great Lord.
We have driven the enemy away.
Your very arrival made them run away.
They enemy was consumed with fear.
This is no victory.
I know my enemy well.
And they will fight
to their last breath.
They are no cowards to run away.
This chapter does not end for me here.
Acharya, everyone is present here.
Please answer me.
Why did you command us to fall back
right when we were
about to seize victory?
I had Dhananand right in front of me.
I could have killed
him with great ease.
Chandragupta.
At times one has lose a
battle in order to win the war.
What do you mean?
Let me tell you.
Do you remember
that even a mighty
Emperor like Alexander
had to yield before Jhelum?
I remember, Acharya.
You had told me that
the battle of Jhelum
was fought between
King Puru and Alexander
and Alexander's army
refused to cross the river.
They opposed this command.
But how does that affect us?
Yes, it does. A lot.
And I am pleased that
you know our history
but do you know why
Alexander's mighty army
refused to cross the river Jhelum?
You do not know the answer, right?
For the answer you
must look well at this map.
Magadh is in the centre.
And to the three sides
there are three rivers
that grant Magadh such safety.
Great Ganga to the north,
river Champa in the east
and Surya river in the west.
It is defended in the
south by rocky terrain.
If you were to overlook
the mighty army of Magadh
using these rivers, Magadh army
can tackle any invasion.
Alexander's generals knew this well.
Vdreadful
than crossing the
waters of river Jhelum.
To reach Magadh, one must cross Ganga.
Had we won this battle today
we would be defeated for certain,
in the war.
We would have lost
before we even fought!
And with our defeat
millions of soldiers would die.
Yes, it is true.
No one has ever dreamt
of attacking Magadh.
But Acharya, you knew all of this.
And yet you attacked
the barracks at Ganga?
Durdhara.
I understand Acharya's strategy.
This battle was a mere ruse.
Now that Dhananand has seen
that we have set our
mark on his prime barracks
then he would begin
with reinforcements
and he will divert his resources
all the way to the
barracks at river Ganga.
Precise, Chandragupta.
This assault has plunged
fear deep within Dhananand.
Now Dhananand will have
guards protecting the barrack
day in and day out.
He will be focused to
strengthen these barracks.
And now he shall start
building watch towers
army encampments,
healers and armouries.
So we will attack that barrack soon
and capture it.
Yes, Stul.
And hence we will
take over the barrack
we minimal losses
and lesser resources.
Thus weakening Dhananand's army.
You are right, Chandragupta.
If I am not wrong
then by dusk tomorrow
Dhananand will have
the barracks ready.
Yes, Acharya.
Then we shall make our first move
in the land of Magadh, tomorrow night.
And we shall take our next step
in uniting the great land of India.
I know that you must be wondering
why I am sitting in
my room the whole night
and extracting gold from this stone
when my enemies,
Chanakya and Chandragupta
must be planning something against me.
Isn't it?
Tara, there are some
habits which never change.
And this is one habit which
I cannot change even if I want to
because this habit
is connected to my dearest sister,
Durdhara.
'Your brother,
King Dhananand did many things'
'for one smile of yours.'
'He united the earth, sky and land.'
'But you have returned'
'the favour of his love with betrayal,
Princess.'
Are you still thinking
about what Amatya said?
Chandra, do not misunderstand me.
I have no regrets of supporting you
in this war for justice
and becoming your wife.
But there is one thing
which always keeps bothering me.
No matter how my brother is in life
but his love towards me
has always been pure and true.
So true that even after
I found out the truth
and despite me breaking
all my ties with him
he continued our yearly tradition.
Which tradition?
On every 'Raksha Bandhan', me
and my sister follow this tradition.
Tara, you know Durdhara very well.
She likes rare things.
On the occasion of
one 'Raksha Bandhan'
she asked me for a jewellery
designed by my hands.
That year
brother went to his gold mine
where he chose a huge stone.
Brother kept extracting
gold from it for many days.
And he made a jewellery from the gold
that he extracted from his hands.
From that year
we started following this
tradition on every 'Raksha Bandhan'.
Durdhara and I look forward
to 'Raksha Bandhan' every year.
Durdhara draws a jewellery
pattern that she likes
and I design that jewellery by
extracting gold with my own hands.
Look at this, Tara.
Durdhara and my
relationship ended long ago.
But I cannot get rid of this habit.
Why are you hurting yourself,
Dhananand?
What do you gain by doing all this?
Just wait and watch.
My sister will definitely
return to me and
I will give her all the jewellery that
I could not give her from many years.
That traitor might
have acquired my gold mine
and he might have taken
my sister away from me.
But I am sure
that I will get
everything back one day.
Priest, do not lie to me.
Amatya had come here many days ago.
And you are telling
me that he never came here.
I am not lying.
Neither did Amatya come here
nor was a 'Mahamrityunjaya'
veneration conducted
for Queen Tarini's mother.
What are you saying, Priest?
Yes, Kairvarta.
But I know one thing.
What do you know?
That the dead bodies of
Magadh's soldiers were found
at a distance from here.
That was done by Chandragupta.
He killed the soldiers
and kidnapped Amatya.
Some people even told me
that Chandragupta could do this
because Queen Tarini had helped him.
I will have to inform
the king immediately.
If Tarini is plotting
against the king
I will have to inform
the king immediately.
No, I should act sensibly
and not in a hurry.
If I accuse Tarini
without any evidence
the king will give
me a death sentence.
Now, Amatya himself
will testify against Tarini.
I will have to free
Amatya from the clutches
of Chandragupta somehow.
Listen to me, Durdhara.
I know that you still love
Dhananand a lot.
But the only difference is
love is just a burden for Dhananand
where he wants the person
who loves him to follow his orders.
But you do not deserve
such a brother's love, Durdhara.
You know, you need a brother
who loves you way more than that.
Chandra! How dare you
make my sister Durdhara cry!
That too on the occasion
of 'Raksha Bandhan'!
Stul, why..
I did not do anything.
Just give me a signal
I will set Chandra
straight right away.
Stulbhadra, it was not my intention
to make your sister cry.
But are you telling the truth or..
Okay. Finally my lovely sister
is smiling!
Come on, Queen, hurry up.
Tie this 'Rakhi' on my wrist.
On my way here, these sweets
tempted me many times.
Today I promise you as your brother
that I will always protect
you till my last breath.
Every danger headed your way
will have to go through me.
And I also promise you
that I will never let you be sad.
And I will always try
to protect this sweet smile of yours.
Look, Tara.
My sister will surely like this gift.
Right?
Truly, Dhananand!
I do not understand
this behaviour of yours.
Till yesterday you were
baying for Chandragupta's blood
and today you are making
jewellery for your sister
oblivious to your
enemy's conspiracies.
Really.. You worry too much, Tara.
I have already made
arrangements to take care
of that Chandragupta and Chanakya.
Arrangements?
What does that mean?
Your enemy's enemy is your friend.
Within a week,
that Chandragupta's enemy
meaning my friend,
will come for his revenge.
And then the two of us
will defeat Chandragupta.
'Revenge from Chandragupta?'
'Is Seleucus this
new friend of Dhananand?'
'If that is the case, then I have
to warn Chandragupta immediately.'
'It seems this war is heading
towards its final stage.'
From Tarini's message, I understand
what Dhananand's next plan would be.
But before the final attack on Magadh
we have to make some facts clear.
Have Dhananand and Seleucus
really joined hands?
And is Seleucus coming
to India within a week?
But how will we find
out if all this is true?
We have no other reliable source
except Tarini's message.
We do.
Paurav's king Malayketu
has confirmed this, Durdhara.
Stulbhadra must be
on his way with evidence.
These are Greek soldiers.
Yes.
King Malayketu told
us that his army killed
these soldiers in
the Hindu Kush valley.
Maybe these Greek soldiers
were trying to enter India
through the Hindu Kush valley.
King Malayketu also said
his spies have informed him
that the Greek army's
activity has increased
on the north side
of Hindu Kush valley.
That means, Dhananand
and Seleucus have made a pact.
That is why he is
advancing towards India.
They must have a
huge army ready by now.
Acharya, I think the time has come
to make our final attack on Magadh
and dethrone Dhananand
before the two enemies of India
Dhananand and Seleucus,
can join forces.
Chandragupta, we need to
be quick about what have to do.
Because soon this news
will reach Dhananand.
And he will definitely
call upon Amatya Rakshas
as soon as he gets this news.
And then he will know that
Amatya Rakshas is our prisoner.
Yes, Acharya.
Before Dhananand finds
out Amatya is missing
we have to get Tarini
out of the palace.
Its people make a nation great.
But often those very
people start undervaluing
their nation and its freedom.
Remember that this freedom
is not your heritage
or your inheritance.
It is the invaluable
treasure we received
through the tireless work
sacrifice and selfless
service of thousands of people.
That is why, always remain
grateful and loyal to your nation.
Because we exist
because of our nation.
My ethics..
Your destiny.
'Where are the 'Vishkanyas'?'
- Stop.
- Who is stopping my maids
from entering the palace?
Let them in.

================================================================================

Episode: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhwaUupkYqM

Acharya, as always I am not able
to understand this plan too.
First, you made us
catch so many fishes.
After that, you make us throw
these dead fishes back into the river.
How will we claim that cantonment?
Is it your plan to make
the soldiers there unconscious
due to the smell of these fishes?
No!
But my plan has started
showing its result.
What is this bad smell?
This the smell of these dead fishes.
You are right.
Come, let us go.
Chandra, Acharya will
not explain his plan to me.
But you explain it
to me in simple words.
Stulbhadra, just how we fix the bait
to the net in order to catch fishes
these dead fishes
are also the bait for us
due to whom they will come on
their own to get trapped in our plan.
Chandra, thank you for this great
knowledge on how to catch fishes.
But I still did not understand
why we are throwing these
dead fishes into the river.
Stulbhadra,
complete the assigned work first.
The reason will be
clear when the time comes.
Okay.
But, Acharya,
how will we fool Dhananand?
Because after sunset,
Dhananand will be observing
the cantonment like a vulture.
Do not worry, Stulbhadra.
Acharya has made
arrangements for that too.
'Vishkanyas'.
Our 'vishkanyas' will
be reaching Magadh anytime.
They will create
a problem for Dhananand
which will definitely
make this cantonment ours.
'Where are the 'Vishkanyas'?'
'Dhananand can proceed
towards the cantonment anytime.'
Stop. This is the king's order.
Neither will anybody leave the palace
nor enter the palace
till sunrise tomorrow.
Who is stopping my maids
from entering the palace?
The king himself has
appointed these maids for me.
And you are stopping their entry.
I am sorry, Queen.
Let them in.
'Dhananand will get a doubt
if he spots me with them.'
Tara, what are you doing here?
I had come to see for one last time
whether your decision
of going for the war is firm.
Tara, I am sure that when
this war ends we still start
a new phase of our lives.
But I will have to end the lives
of Chanakya and
Chandragupta before that.
Dhananand is close to the cantonment.
Archers, be ready.
Dhananand is also going
to reach the cantonment now.
Tell me now at least how we
are going to acquire the cantonment
with the help of the dead fishes.
Take this, Stulbhadra.
See for yourself.
What is this bad smell?
You need not worry, Your Majesty.
These are some dead fishes.
They have come to the bank of the
river due to the force of the water.
This is the bad smell of those fishes.
This is a river and not a sea
whose force is strong enough
to bring anything to the shore.
Get the boat ready.
This must be Chanakya's plan
to fool me.
Magadh's army is boarding
the boats and coming towards us.
But why? We had..
Okay, this is why we threw
the dead fishes into the river again.
Yes, Stulbhadra.
Did you understand now?
As Chandragupta mentioned
these dead fishes will work as a bait
to trap our enemies.
Yes.
When Magadh's army reached mid-river
we will attack them.
And by the time Dhananand
and his army realises anything
it would be very late by then.
There are no enemy
boats over here, Sire.
Nor there is any suspicious
movement over this side.
All we see are dead fish in the water.
There is oil on the fishes!
So that cunning Chanakya
has poured oil in the river!
Fall back to the banks at once!
Kill every soldier
of Chandragupta's army!
Spare no one! Charge!
Acharya!
We did not plan to
destroy that barrack
but to capture it
and use those resources!
But if the war rages on the
barracks will be ruined shortly.
Rest assured, Stul.
Soon this war will come to halt.
Dhananand will not stay here for long.
And once he leaves from this place
the barracks will fall to us.
Our strategy has succeeded.
Dhananand's men have
reached him with news.
'Hail the Lord of Magadh!'
'We have news from palace.'
'Chandragupta's assassins
have infiltrated the palace.'
'We do not know what
guise they have taken.'
'But the guards of the
palace are being killed.'
Tara..
Is Tara safe?
'She is in the palace, Sire.'
And her guards?
The Queen's chambers and
the palace have been locked down
till we eliminate the assassins.
Chandragupta and Chanakya
have launched a double strike.
They have kept you
here in the battlefield
While the Queen is back at the palace.
What will we do now, Sire?
We will kill the enemy!
We will not let these barracks fall.
Acharya.
It seems that our move
to send assassins to the palace
bears no use!
Dhananand is not
leaving this encampment!
Where are you hiding, you vermin?
Come to me, if you bear courage!
Stul, Dhananand will leave.
Have some patience.
Chandra, how can you be so certain?
Since his love is in peril.
And in a war amidst love
and hatred love always wins.
So rest assured.
I cannot lose Tara once again.
Nothing and no one
means more to me than Tara.
I must assure her safety.
Sir, forgive me.
We will lose the barracks
if you leave from here.
Be it a defeat or a victory!
Nothing matters more
to me than my Tara.
If I am to choose between
Tara and these barracks
I will pick Tara. Move!
Chandragupta,
it is time to end this battle.
Yes, Acharya.
Stul, send a message to Durdhara
and tell her everything
is well over here.
Dhananand, prepare yourself
to be defeated for the first time
on the land of Magadh!
Did you get any message from Chandra?
It has been a long time since he left.
Why did we not hear from him yet?
I think I should personally
go there and find out if he is fine.
Pardon me, Queen.
Acharya Chanakya has clearly directed
that you cannot go out of the palace
until we get a message from him.
All right.
But go right now find out about them.
Chandragupta might
have sent a message.
Go.
Your work is done, Kaivarta.
I have interchanged Chandragupta's
message with the one written by you.
And the soldiers who
are carrying this message
have no idea about it.
Very good.
Now we just need to
wait for the right time.
Queen, King Chandragupta's
message is here.
It is Sthul who has sent this message.
'We have won Dhananand's cantonment.'
'But Chandragupta is wounded
after Dhananand's attack.'
'Acharya has directed
you to reach Dhananand's camp'
'beside the River Ganga, immediately.'
'Leave from the palace
soon after you get this message.'
Durdhara has left from the palace.
And now, there is nobody here
to stop us from getting Amatya free.
Come on!
The strategies of the guru
and the weapon of the pupil
showed its magic once again.
Dhananand's camp is now ours
along with everything it has.
Good!
This form of you
was missing since years.
Whatever you did today
was in the capacity of
the Magadh's army commander.
I will surely tell His Highness
as to how you
courageously got me free.
And now
it is impossible for Chanakya
and Chandragupta to survive.
Brave soldiers this is our
first victory on the soil of Magadh.
We must make the whole Magadh free
just like how we freed this land.
And once Chandragupta
dethrones Dhananand
all of us will proceed towards
our dream of United Bharat.
One country,
one king, Chandragupta Maurya.
- Long live Chandragupta Maurya!
- Long live!
- Long live Chandragupta Maurya!
- Long live!
- Long live Chandragupta Maurya!
- Long live!
Chandra..
Durdhara.
Are you fine?
Thank God! You are fine.
But if you are fine
what about that message..
What message?
Durdhara, what are you doing here?
I asked you to stay in the palace.
Our messenger gave me a message.
It was written that Dhananand
has wounded you severely
and Acharya has asked me to come here.
But I had sent you a message
that everything is fine here.
Then..
That means,
someone interchanged my message.
- Who could do that?
- Kaivarta.
He did not accompany
Dhananand in this battle
and even Tarini does
not know where he is.
That means, Kaivarta has come to know
that we have abducted Amatya.
He did this to get Amatya free.
Acharya, we must return
to the palace immediately.
The dust that lies in
our path holds no importance.
But this dust does teach
us something very important.
If we step on it
it rises with the wind
and tries to challenge us.
If it gets into our eyes
it can cause discomfort.
Hence if you are a powerful person
never underestimate
anyone or consider him weak.
If you are weak
do not tolerate exploitation.
Learn to avenge.
Because a weak person remains as such
as long as he doesn't oppose
the injustice done to him.
My ethics..
Your destiny.
There is still time,
Call a truce with Chandragupta..
The world bows to Magadh!
Magadh doesn't bow to anyone.
That will never happen!
Tara! Wake up, Tara!
Tara!

'On one hand Kingdom of Kauravas,
Takshashila'
'Piplivan, Sindh and Punjab's
armies were coming together'
'in support of Chandragupta.'
'On the other hand Dhananand
who had 14 kingdoms'
'under him was alone today.'
'The people who were affected
by Dhananand's misrule'
'were hoping for a new governance.
And came in support of Chandragupta.'
The people who want to
free their land from bad rulers
like Dhananand and want to
fight against him are all welcome.
Because this is not
a war but a religious war
against anarchy,
sub ordinance for homeland
for a united India.
Long live India!
Long live India! Long live India!
'Where on one hand Chandragupta
was getting stronger'
'on the other hand
Dhananand was losing'
'his companions because of his ego.'
'He was alone and helpless
in the path of injustice today.'
'But still he was ready for the war.'
'Because nothing was more important'
'to him than his
throne in this world.'
'That day, despite of not wanting'
'Dhananand was recollecting
that incident from the '
'which was the reason'
for today's war.'
'To suppress your opinion of a united
India I called for this meeting.'
'So that with you,
everybody else here sees'
'that I am a big river full of energy'
'and you are just a grain of sand'
'who can stay in the
corner and can touch my feet'
'but if you come in my way,
you will be flushed away.'
'The crest you have insulted today'
'I swear on this crest'
'that I will destroy your
Nanda dynasty, Dhananand.'
'I will make you leave this throne'
'and make a deserving
ruler sit on the throne.'
'Years ago, who Dhananand
thought of as a small person'
'that person today had come'
'to challenge Dhananand's empire'
'with his student Chandragupta.'
Chandra,
there is still no news of Tarini
and by now she should
have come with us.
War does not wait for anybody,
Stulbhadra.
Acharya, how can you be so heartless?
In this war,
Tarini has helped us a lot.
Without her help we
wouldn't have reached here.
It is our responsibility
to protect her.
We have to carefully
take her out of the palace.
Chandra, you make acharya understand.
Like all of you, even I want
Tarini to come back here safely.
But acharya is right too.
Now it is impossible to
stop this war cycle for anybody.
Because in this war, our country's
future and our freedom is at stake.
There is nothing important than that.
If we make one single
mistake in order to save Tarini
then the course of
the war will change.
The circumstances which
are in our favour today
can turn against us later.
That is why, for Tarini, right now
we can just pray to God
and hope for her to come back.
Let the war begin!
I am the king of Magadh
and nobody can take the king's throne.
Queen.
You take rest.
You need to take rest.
Where is Dhananand?
King is getting ready for the war.
Chandragupta has reached
the border of Magadh with his army.
'I will have to leave the
palace as soon as possible.'
'Chandragupta and others
must be waiting for me.'
Forgive me, Queen.
You can't leave the
palace and go outside.
I do not care about
the rules of the war.
I can't stay like
a prisoner in this room.
I am not telling you
about the rules of a war.
I am telling you about
the rules of Magadh dynasty
which you'll have to follow.
Because you are pregnant.
In other words, by the laws
followed by Magadhan royalty
you cannot leave the
palace until you give birth.
The king had ordered
for him to be informed
as soon as you regain consciousness.
I will be back after informing him
of this good news.
Please wait, Physician.
Do not do it.
I will inform the king.
And consider it as
an order from your queen.
Your order shall be obeyed, my Queen.
But I must inform the
king about your health.
He is worried for you.
'This is the truth Tarini
that Dhananand killed your father.'
'Dhananand killed your father
in such a way'
'that you would believe
that he died a natural death.'
'Father, take this.'
I must leave here.
I cannot let my child be influenced
by Dhananand's anger and hate.
See the irony, Dhananand.
Our union is going
to bring a life into this world
and I want to keep it
far away from you.
The army of Magadh is ready..
But where is Dhananand?
Is he not the only
one left to lead them?
It looks like Dhananand is coming.
Soldiers! Get ready!
Why is Amatya Rakshas here?
'Amatya is leading
the army of Magadh.'
'Then where is Dhananand?'
I thought you had left for the battle.
I was going but I got
informed that you have regained
your consciousness and health.
Therefore, I came here
to spend some time with you.
Come.
What happened?
Why are you looking at me like this?
The war I am going into will show me
only blood and death.
I want to take with me the
memories of the special moments
we spent together.
Do you remember that moment?
Yes, I remember.
Do you know,
when I saw you for the first time
I was convinced that we
will be together for a long time.
Time has changed a
lot about our relationship.
I was aware of it..
But little did I know that the change
will bring such pain.
What do you mean?
This is the royal ring of Magadh
which you and your brother wear.
But do you know which of
my brothers does it belong to?
It belongs to my brother Pandu.
This must have come off his hand
when you killed him
in his mother's hut.
Luckily, Mahamatya found it.
And this is the proof
of your betrayal towards me.
Take a good look at this chamber.
I got this made especially
for you during our wedding.
Each wall of this chamber
has been carefully crafted
keeping in mind your
preferred designs.
Every object you see in this chamber
has been made according
to your choice.
I thought, from this chamber
we would start a new life.
This chamber would
herald a bright future.
A future whose dreams
I no longer cherish, Tara.
You were the one..
From the beginning,
you were the one who betrayed me.
It is rightfully said
that love is blind. And I..
And I blindly fell in love with you.
Mahamatya warned me several times
that you are betraying me..
That you have teamed up with my foes
and are conspiring against me but I..
I ignored his warnings.
You..
You posed as a spy
for that imbecile and Chanakya..
And told me..
'Where were you for such a long time?'
'I.. I had gone to see my mother'
'to inform her that I will be staying'
'in Magadh for some more time.'
The reason I brought
you in this palace
is because I wanted
to rekindle our relation
and start our lives afresh.
But you secretly sided with Chandragupta
and murdered all my brothers
one at a time.
Through Dashasidhika
you got Ambikumar killed.
And then, you made me kill
the senior Dashasidhika.
You did not grieve the
horrific end Mansa met with.
You were confused
because he had saved you
from the house of Brother Bhutapala.
And I..
I killed Mansa.
And you killed Brother Pandugati
and told me..
'How come these blood stains
are on your dress?'
'There is some problem
with mother's lungs.'
'Her nose bleeds sometimes.'
You lied!
I still believed you.
You brought Brother Pandu to his death
also, you helped Chandragupta
win my gold mine.
Not just this, it was you
who helped the 'vishkanyas'
enter this palace
because you knew that
I would definitely come
to save you, over the cantonment
on the banks of Ganges.
And it was you who
brought differences between
me and my trustworthy
Amatya and got him captured
by Chandragupta and Chanakya.
You were the one.
My love, my life, my Tara..
You betrayed me.
Yes.
It was me.
I had closed all the doors of the past
that could bring me back to you,
Dhananand.
I did not want to return to your life.
When Chandragupta and
Chanakya made me realise
that if I do not help them put an end
to your cruelty and inhumanity
a power-crazy king like you would make
the lives of many
innocent people miserable.
I had come here with an
intention of destroying you.
I mean, I hated you.
But you know what, Dhananand?
I do not want to tell you this.
But you were right.
My hatred had a little
bit of love for you, Dhananand.
I have told you many lies, Dhananand.
But my love towards you was not false.
I had loved you honestly.
I was sure that I could
change you with my love.
That is why I betrayed
Chandragupta too
due to which Mansa and Queen Mura
had to lose their lives.
But I think their death was important
to break the false illusion of my love
because that is when I realised
that the belief with which
I was proceeding towards you
is just an illusion.
You can never change.
Do you know..
Do you know why am I laughing so much?
Because I am realising now that your
love has made a big fool of me, Tara.
The entire world says
that the king of Magadh,
Dhananand, is very smart.
He is very clever.
But your love fooled me.
You made me believe that you love me
and we can start a new life together.
Why did you do this, Tara?
Why did you lie to me?
You have also told me many lies,
Dhananand.
Can you see these two coins?
They look the same.
But this coin is made up of gold
and this coin, is made of copper.
It is just gold-plated.
Anybody can get fooled for a
moment by looking at this copper coin
until it is tested in a furnace
because after that its truth
will be out in front of everyone.
Similarly, you can fool
the world for a short while
through your external behaviour
because when time tests you
your reality will be exposed.
So, remember this.
The coin of deceit will
not work for a long time.
My ethics..
Your destiny.
Your greed for power and strength
has taken away everything
from your life, Dhananand.
One day, this greed
will kill you too.
I know that you want
to kill me for my betrayal.
Take this. Kill me.

================================================================================

Episode: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aB3y2mLtaHs

Why did you do this, Tarini?
Why did you lie to me?
You have also told me many lies,
Dhananand.
For example, you made me believe
that my father's death was accidental.
But the truth is,
you had murdered my father.
That is why I killed Bhutapala
because he told me how
you joined hands with him
and killed my father deceitfully.
Today, I want to know from you,
Dhananand.
Why did you kill
my father and your guru?
Because he wanted
to separate you from me, Tara.
Have you got me now?
I tried.
By killing my father?
Your greed for power and strength
has taken away everything
from your life, Dhananand.
But you have still not changed.
One day, this greed will kill you too.
Will I be killed?
Nobody knows how much
I have struggled to reach so far.
No Brahmin shares his knowledge
with a barber like me.
No Kshatriya leaves his throne
because according to them
only they have a right
over knowledge and power.
Not a barber Nand like me.
So, I took advantage of
every opportunity that I got.
I joined every particle
and established this kingdom.
Now
why should I not fight to save this?
Why should I let my enemies
take away everything?
You are still looking away
from the reality, Dhananand.
You forgot the deeds
which made you a king
and got drowned with an insecurity
that somebody will come
and take away everything.
He will make you the
weak and helpless barber
Nand, again from a powerful king.
But neither I nor did
anybody else betray you.
Your deeds are the
reason for your downfall.
I know that you want
to kill me for my betrayal.
Take this. Kill me.
During the training, you had told me
that if a dear one betrays you
fool him first
and then stab him.
This will hurt
both of them less.
Am I right?
I want to tell you
something before dying
and it is your right to know this.
I was carrying your child
in my womb.
You do not have any right
to snatch away my love
from my life, Tara.
You do not have any right.
This was the destiny of our love,
Dhananand.
You loved me the most in your life.
But the king of Magadh's
longing has put an end
You are no more, Tara.
Along with that,
all the promises I made to you
have come to an end.
The battleground will be covered
with the blood of the enemies.
I will teach Chandragupta a lesson!
Take a look at the
blood stains on my palm.
It belongs to the two people
whom I couldn't have
even imagined to kill!
This blood belongs
to Tara and my unborn baby!
I smeared this blood
on my palm to show you
that there's no one as powerful as me!
I do not have any weakness
due to which my enemies
can take advantage of.
I am standing in front
of you without any feelings.
I am neither scared of
death nor of getting destroyed.
I will not show mercy on anyone.
Be it, my enemies
or the traitor who
is standing next to you.
Despite getting defeated
by me several times
you and your master have not realised
that I am undefeatable.
But today, I will make sure
that this battle will be your last.
Acharya and I are standing here
because we have learnt
something from past mistakes.
And you are standing here because
you have not realised
your mistakes yet, Dhananand!
Look how distraught
and frightened you are!
You fear that I may
snatch away your throne.
You still have time
to forego your stubbornness
or else, many soldiers
will die from both sides.
I have always told you
that I want to see a free
and a protected country of mine
for a new hope and change.
The tyranny of a cruel
king is going to end!
This is what the future holds!
You cannot change that, Dhananand.
If you want to change something,
then it is your actions.
Again, I give you a last chance.
Without any confrontation
give up your throne
or else, your end will
be cruel and scornful.
Hey!
Think before you say something,
Vishnugupta.
With only a handful soldiers
you think that you
can defeat the army of Magadh.
In no time
I can wipe out your entire army.
And now,
nobody will come to your rescue
because I have made
all the districts so weak
that they are at my mercy.
No, Dhananand. The time has come
for you to get your facts right.
Take a look.
Being your sister
I could have made a last effort
to stop you from fighting,
Your Highness..
But you have gone too far.
Now, I do not want be
witness of your atrocities.
So Sister, you fear that today
you might have to
witness your husband die.
But go.. You are free.
I will make sure
that I gift you
the head of this imbecile.
Stulbhadra take Durdhara
away from this battlefield.
"Chandragupta! Chandragupta!"
"Who attacks the enemies..
Chandragupta!"
Victory to India!
"He is Chandragupta Maurya!"
"He is Chandragupta Maurya."
May our enemies bite the dust.
May our united India become
the greatest in the world.
Attack!
Hail India!
Stulbhadra,
the time has come that you, Malayketu
and the king of Avanti make
arrangements to conduct another attack
from the tent situated
in the bank of the Ganges.
The soldiers of other kingdoms
will arrived by then.
Dhananand your end has begun.
See around.
Amatya Rakshas
where is Seleucus?
I am sure the clouded leopard will
come to the lake to drink water today.
I have been eagerly waiting
for months to hunt him.
But King Seleucus
what about your
friendship with Dhananand?
He must be waiting for you to join him
in the battle against Chandragupta.
What do you think that I have set up
such a large and powerful empire,
Macedonia by striking deals?
No.
I have been able to
set up such a large empire
because I know very
well when I should fight
and when I should keep
quiet and enjoy the drama.
I did not get you, Your Highness.
Tell me one thing.
What do you think?
Who will win the battle
when two lions fight over
a small piece of land in a jungle?
The one who defeats his enemy
will rule over the jungle.
Wrong.
The third lion who is seeing the fight
between other two lions
will rule over the jungle.
The third lion who
is waiting for the moment
when the other two
lions will get injured.
And he will defeat them
and become the king of the jungle.
Let them fight. Let Dhananand and
Chandragupta fight with each other.
I do not care.
Whoever win between them..
I will defeat him
and capture his country.
I made friendship with
Dhananand to enter this country.
It was just a ploy.
I do not care who will win this battle
and sit on the throne of Magadh.
However, I want Chandragupta
to win this battle.
So that I can take the revenge
of my humiliation by defeating him.
I will snatch everything
away from him.
His land, his people..
I will make everyone my slave.
People make many
relationships in their lives.
But it is important for us to know
which relationship will benefit us
and which will harm us.
For an example
no matter how much milk
you feed a poisonous snake
you will not be able
to change its nature.
It will always remain
a poisonous creature.
Similarly your friendship with
a shrewd person
can lead to your fall.
Remember one thing.
Give your time and
respect to that person
who deserves it.
My ethics..
Your destiny.
Chandragupta!

================================================================================

Episode: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYsNLLfypNM

Your Highness, we have found
the path to reach Dhananand.
We can take advantage of it.
We will distract him and you
just look for a chance and kill him.
After that, this battle will be over.
And please take revenge
for Her Majesty Mura's death.
No.
The motive behind this battle is
not the revenge for my mother's death
but the freedom of our motherland.
We are not fighting this
battle just for Her Majesty Mura
we're fighting this for
everyone who is suffering
because of Dhananand's bad governance.
If I kill Dhananand using any trick
then the sacrifice of
all those people will be wasted
who lost their lives for the
principles and values qof this battle.
The way Her Majesty Mura,
my friends Dhoomketu, Indra
and their innocent
children respect the nation
the same way, we'll take
the revenge for their death.
Today, I'll save
my country from anarchy.
I believe that we will win this battle
but with morals and with humanity
without bringing any
disgrace to the Maurya family.
We will definitely win this battle.
Victory to India!
Victory to India..
Victory to India..
Sire, how come those tears
are coming out of your eyes?
These the tears of joy, Chandragupta.
The joy of that teacher
who is witnessing
a strong result of his lessons
here in this battle field.
Amatya, call our rest of the soldiers.
It's not possible, Your Highness.
Chandragupta and Chanakya
have played a double game with us.
They have trapped us here
and attacked our army which
is on standby on the banks of Ganga.
We cannot take back our army,
Your Highness.
Otherwise Chandragupta will
reach our palace very easily.
Amatya, you go towards
the camp and stop them there.
I will see that Chandragupta.
As you wish, Your Highness.
Chandragupta!
I think you forgot something,
Chandragupta.
I was the one who killed your parents
because of which you
became an orphan.
I just upset,
because when I killed your father
then you could not
witness that moment.
But I am happy that
when I killed your mother
then you witnessed
it right in front of you.
Dhananand!
I am not an orphan!
I still have my motherland's
blessings with me.
And it'll remain forever.
Time is running out.
I hope that Stulbhadra
reaches the Magadh palace
by defeating all the
soldiers on his path.
That is it. This is the moment.
- We all will die now.
- No, we cannot give up.
They both are dependent on us.
We cannot leave them alone.
Even I trust them!
He must have planned
something else to help us.
I told you, Sage Chanakya
always has a second plan.
Your Majesty!
You have crossed all the
limits of being a traitor today!
No argument is enough
for your wrong decision.
And this world will
never forgive you for this!
I can say the same to you too, Amatya.
This historical battle will decide
who is right and who is wrong.
Till then,
you just follow your principles
and I will carry my
duty towards my motherland.
Attack!
Durdhara, you have put your
life at risk just to save our lives?
Why? Is it the duty of only
the brothers to protect their sisters?
Can the sisters not
protect their brothers?
All of us should leave
this place immediately.
Acharya has told me a plan
through which we will defeat
Magadha's army before sunset.
Malaykhetu, return towards
the battlefield quickly.
Acharya and Chandra
are waiting for you there.
The moment they see you,
they will get an indication
that our plan is
moving towards success
and we will destroy
Magadha's army soon.
Go.
Before the pause in the war I will
give you one more gift, Dhananand.
Are you ready?
How did you like the gift, Dhananand?
Look at that.
The feeling of guilt
on Amatya's face is your gift.
He could not stop my army
from proceeding towards the palace.
Now, there is not much of a distance
between me and my victory.
The war break has begun.
Now, this war will continue again
after tomorrow's sunrise.
Your Majesty.
- Leave me.
- Your Majesty.
- Leave me.
- The war break has begun.
- We will have to go back.
- Amatya Rakshas, leave me.
We will handle him tomorrow,
Your Majesty.
Come with me.
Come, friends. Rest for sometime.
The war break has begun.
Well done, Chandragupta.
Your team was stronger
on the first day of the war.
But we do not have time to rest.
Let us think about
tomorrow's strategy.
- Let us go.
- Okay, Acharya.
What is the matter, Malaykhetu?
Why do you look worried?
No. Nothing has happened.
I will go to the cantonment
and inform Stulbhadra
that everything is all right here.
Do not worry, Your Majesty.
We will defeat our enemies tomorrow.
I cannot wait till tomorrow, Amatya.
Malaykhetu!
Nothing will happened to you.
Someone call Royal Physician. Fast!
No, Chandra..
I know these are my last moments.
You did this intentionally, right?
You knew that Dhananand
would attack again.
That is why you stayed back, right?
I know Dhananand's nature very well.
After all, he had betrayed my father
King Puru in the same way.
You should not have done this,
Malaykhetu.
You should not have
sacrificed your life for me.
You could have warned me.
My life and my living
is because of you.
Before meeting you
I was staying in Ambhiraj's prison.
You are the one who
freed me from there.
'Come out, friends.'
You have given me a new life.
And you made me the
king of the Paurava Dynasty.
'I, Chandragupta Maurya,
the king of Piplivan'
'son of King Chandravardhan'
'consider Queen Mura
as a witness today'
'and declare you as the
king of the Paurava Dynasty'
'and the real heir of the kingdom.'
Before meeting you, I was just living.
But you gave a new
direction to my life.
Today, I am very happy
that I got a proud death
while serving the
greatest king of India.
Only one task is left.
Tell me.
- Acharya.
- Yes.
Please complete that pending task.
I, Vishnugupta Chanakya
consider all of you as
a witness today and declare
that the king of Paurava, Malaykhetu
is handing over the Paurava Dynasty
to our king, Chandragupta.
From today and this moment
the Paurava Dynasty
and all its responsibilities
will be handled by
King Chandragupta Maurya
as per the will of King Malaykhetu.
- Hail India!
- Hail India!
I promise you
I won't let your sacrifice go waste.
At sunrise tomorrow
I will take revenge on Dhananand
for the murder of Malayketu.
I will answer his deceit
with my power.
Pardon us Chandragupta.
None of us can help you in this war.
In today's war, our side was strong.
But with Malayketu's murder
Dhananand has given
us a huge set back.
Don't forget that you
were the target for Dhananand.
Malayketu lost his life saving you.
So it is clearly evident that
Dhananand can stoop to
any level to protect his kingdom.
No one can predict what
is in store for us tomorrow.
It is with great difficulty
that we got our sons back.
We don't want to
risk their lives again.
I thank you very much
for your support until now.
Chandra, you didn't even
try to convince them. Why?
Because they had made up their minds.
Instead of having men
who fight half-heartedly
it is better to go ahead
with the ones who are still with us.
But Chandra, how will we win this war?
We don't have either
enough army or any help.
By the way, O King
you have dealt him a blow
so severe that he will surely lose.
With the death of Malayketu
all the local leaders are frightened
and they have withdrawn
their support to Chandragupta.
Now, Chandragupta has
only a handful of men.
Tomorrow, even before the war starts
both Chanakya and Chandragupta
will lose their dream and lives.
Chief minister, do you know
what happens when dust
is crushed under the foot?
I didn't get you.
That's it. Did you see that?
When I tried to crush
dust under my foot
then the dust rose up in the air
and tried to take away your eyesight.
Our enemies are also like this dust.
Whenever we try to crush them
they rise higher.
Whether he gets the
support of the masses or not
he will surely find
some or the other way
to win the war against me.
Defeat and victory is a part of life.
But if you really want
to test your calibre
always compete with
a person better than you.
Even if you lose against that person
you will learn quite a few things.
And if you defeat that person
then you will reach
new heights of success.
If you want to reach
new heights of success
always compete with a better person.
Only then you will attain perfection.
My ethics..
Your destiny.
The time has come that all of you win
over your fear, grief and mind like me.
Hence, I am begging you.
Please help us
in tomorrow's battle.

================================================================================

Episode: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFldjU48NiI

Chandra, it is getting delayed
to perform Malay's last rites.
You need to light his pyre quickly.
Let everyone come first, Durdhara.
After that,
his last rites will be performed.
I know
you must be wondering
what announcement
I will make at this moment
after the first day of the war.
As you know, we have lost
our beloved king, Malayketu, today.
I did not call all of you here
to shed tears in his condolence meet.
I do not want you to shed tears
on Malay's martyrdom.
If you want to do something
then take inspiration from him.
Take inspiration from all the martyrs
who have sacrificed their lives
in this battle of righteousness.
King Chandravardhan!
Dhumkethu!
Agnimukh!
Baldev!
Indra!
Queen Mura.
Mansa!
Tarani!
And now, Malayketu.
The had only one goal,
the freedom of our
motherland united India.
And they have attained martyrdom
in order to fulfill their goal.
They were very close to me.
Whenever, I lose my loved ones
I feel as if one
organ has been amputated
from my body.
But as you know,
their sacrifice never weakened me.
In fact, their sacrifice
has made me more determined
to fight against Dhananand.
Hence, I have called all of you here.
Friends, the time has come
that all of you win over your fear
grief and mind like me.
And get united to
free your motherland.
If you still keep quiet
and display your helplessness
then more people will get killed
because of Dhananand's torture.
Hence, I am begging you.
Please help us
in tomorrow's battle.
Give Dhananand a befitting reply.
Get united and take part
in this battle of righteousness.
Your intention is great, dear.
But those hands which did not
break bread with respect for years..
How will they shatter
the enemy's confidence?
How will they fight for you tomorrow?
I know that all of you consider
yourselves weak compared to Dhananand.
But let me remind you one thing.
Every drop of water makes an ocean.
And the elixir comes out
after the churning of the ocean.
"Chandragupta.."
If you want to get a taste of freedom
then you need to be united.
You need to churn yourselves.
And if you feel scared
thinking that you will face
Dhananand's wrath in tomorrow's battle
then I, Chandragupta Maurya,
assure you
that I will be standing
at the front as your shield
in tomorrow's battle.
Tonight is the opportunity
for you to free yourself.
If you do not do anything today
rulers like Dhananand
will keep ruling over you.
And he will satisfy his greed,
lust and interest
and create an atmosphere of anarchy.
Would you like to
pass your next generation
the shackles of slavery?
Do you want this?
No, right?
Hence, I have come
here with one request.
I expect from you
that in tomorrow's battle
at least one member of every
family of Magadha will fight for us.
Please believe me.
Your participation can
change the fate of this battle
and change your fate as well.
It is up to you now
whether you want to live like a slave
or you want to end your slavery.
Go back your home
and think about this.
And if anyone wants to support us
keep a peacock feather
outside your house
by tomorrow's sunrise.
Whoever will keep a peacock
feather outside their house
we will understand that
the members of that family
are with us
"Chandragupta Maurya!"
Hail India!
Hail India!
'I hope that tomorrow's
sunrise will invoke patriotism'
'in the heart of
the people of Magadha.'
Chandra..
I have a question for you.
If most of the people
from Magadha takes our side
then, how will we arrange
weaponry for them?
Durdhara, I know
you are trying to increase
my self-confidence..
So that,
before the battle starts today
I don't lose my confidence.
Chandragupta, I have learnt from you
when we do not see any hope miles away
then, even a ray of
hope is a saving grace.
Look. Even Stulbhadra is here.
How many peacock
feathers did you fetch?
How.. How many families
are supporting us?
Chandra, not a single feather
we could fetch from any houses.
Neither we have the army
nor the support of
the people of Magadha.
A battle is won not by an army
but courage, Stulbhadra.
And my courage will not
shatter till you all are with me.
I believe
that the motherland
for whom we are fighting
she will definitely help us.
Your Highness,
I still remember that you had said
you will not celebrate
before you become victorious.
Look at that army.
I do not think they
can sustain our attack.
Mahamatya..
Only a strategy can confront weaponry.
And you should not underestimate
the strategy of that
crooked monk Chanakya.
- Attack!
- Attack!
Get ready, my warriors!
Today, we will give a befitting reply
to their might with our genius minds!
Attack!
Attack!
Enough!
Enough of this!
You imbecile!
I knew that you will
not concede defeat so easily
and will fight till your last breath.
But today, you will realise
that how small and weak you are
in front of the great
and mighty ruler of Magadha!
Charge!
'I have to find a way to thwart the
attack of this elephant of Dhananand'
'or else, very soon,
the elephant will crush us all.'
Dhananand is destroying
all our weaponry.
Even Acharya is not to be seen.
What will happen now?
Your end has begun, Chandragupta.
What!
Are the elephants
of the king attacking us?
Yes, Queen.
All our defensive weapons
have been battered
and most of our soldiers
have been martyred.
Durdhara.
Acharya, Dhananand's
elephant has attacked us.
There must be some way
to calm this elephant down.
We do not want to
calm his elephant down.
We need to make it mad.
I have an idea. Come.
Chandra!
Citizens of Magadha, attack!
Acharya, what are the
citizens of Magadha doing here?
'Acharya, are we too late in coming
to help Chandragupta in this war?'
'You are not late.
You are right on time.'
Together we will
show Dhananand the power
of democracy and unity today.
But what about this elephant?
How do we get rid of it?
Acharya has a plan. Look there.
No!
Look carefully, Dhananand!
The people of Magadha
whom you always disrespected
have become my strength
and are standing with me today.
You defeated my mother, my father
and my motherland,
Piplivan, through deceit.
But I will win this war with my might.
I am giving you the last chance.
Protect your throne
from me if you can.
Have you ever wondered
that even if a tornado hits a forest
a common bird does not get worried?
It sits on some tree branch
and waits out the storm.
The bird does not worry that the
branch it is sitting upon might break.
Or the tree it is sitting
upon might fall down.
The bird does not worry
about its safety because
it believes in its wings
and its ability to fly.
If we believe
in our strengths and our talents
an enemy can never harm us.
My ethics..
Your destiny.
I request you to grant
him life due to my love for him.
If Dhananand's life is spared today
what will be the value of
Acharya's many years of meditation
and his efforts of gaining
victory in this war?

================================================================================

Episode: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkw8_Y4FI_E

Stop, Chandragupta!
Chandra, Acharya, nobody in this world
knows my brother better than me.
I know that his name
will be written in black
letters in the history of India.
He will be remembered as the
most cruel, cunning and selfish king.
But there is one ray
of hope in this black life.
His selfless and great love
towards his sister.
I request you, Chandra.
I request you to grant him life
due to my love for him.
Durdhara, you are not asking me
to spare Dhananand's life
but this is a humiliation
towards my guru, Chanakya
and many innocent people and martyrs.
If Dhananand's life is spared today
what will be the value
of Acharya's many years of meditation
and his efforts of gaining
victory in this war?
I will definitely kill him today.
Chandragupta, leave him.
Acharya,
how can you accept this request?
The one whom you fought against
was the king of Magadha, Dhananand.
But this helpless man in front of you
is not the king of Magadha.
But he is definitely
your wife's brother.
So, he deserves one chance.
He has lived a barbaric
life as the king of Magadha.
He may rectify his mistakes
as an ordinary man.
If he does not do this even then
you are the king of Magadha now.
Give him a death sentence.
But, Acharya..
This is your guru's order,
Chandragupta.
As you say, Acharya.
I will spare his life.
But on one condition.
I, Chandragupta Maurya
declare in front
of the people of Magadha
that from this moment
the previous king of Magadha, Dhananand
has been exiled from Magadha.
I had given life to
Dhananand with this condition
that Dhananand will never step
on the land of Magadha henceforth.
And if he does this I myself
will give him a death sentence.
How dare you exile
the king of Magadha
from his own kingdom?
Amatya, my guru has taught me
that scholars should be respected
even if that scholar is like you.
So, let me remind
you with all the respect
that Dhananand is not
the king of Magadha now.
I am the king now.
Chandragupta Maurya.
Chandragupta!
Amatya, control your anger.
The next wheel is also in his favour.
So, let him speak.
Remember this, Chandragupta.
This war has not ended yet
because your end is left
in this war.
This is what should happen
to a monster like you.
In end Magadha have been
freed from your torture.
Today, the people of
Magadha have been freed
from the rule of a
cruel and torturous king.
Now, it is time
for a king who worries
about the welfare of the people
and protects the welfare
of the people to sit on the throne.
Chandragupta Maurya.
- Hail Chandragupta Maurya.
- All hail!
- Hail Chandragupta Maurya.
- All hail!
- Hail Chandragupta Maurya.
- All hail!
- Hail Chandragupta Maurya.
- All hail!
Your Majesty,
I know that destiny has brought us
to a situation that
we had never dreamed about.
But trust me.
Amatya Rakshas promises you
that I will turn
your dream into reality.
We will get everything
back that was taken away from us.
Just trust my loyalty.
Loyalty.
Amatya, do you know
what is your problem?
You can only give me an evidence
of your loyalty and assurance.
But I want a solution
to my problem now.
Not your loyalty.
That traitor must
be making arrangements
to sit on my throne now, Amatya.
And once he sits on my throne
everything will be changed.
The entire country will laugh at me.
The powerful and undefeatable
Dhananand will become a laughing
stock in front of everyone.
No, Your Majesty.
I will never let this happen.
What will you not
let to happen, Amatya?
What will you stop?
You have never been
able to stop Chandra.
He took my pride and honour
and you could not stop him.
He banished me from my own kingdom
and you could not stop him.
Amatya, I considered you
the greatest investment
of my life but you..
But you proved to be
a burden holding me down.
It was my fault that I was dependent
on someone else to protect my throne.
But now..
I do not know need anyone anymore.
Not even you, Amatya.
Go, Chandragupta, take your throne.
What have you done, Chandragupta!
Forgive me, Acharya,
but how can I sit on this throne?
You chose me to make
me the emperor of India
and begin a new chapter
for our country.
You removed Dhananand from
his throne and chose me to sit on it.
It is because you wanted to bring
an end to Dhananand and his ideology.
How can the new chapter,
the new ideology
being with this old throne?
It is not only a throne.
It is a symbol of Dhananand's anarchy
of his injustice of his misrule
which have been going on
in this royal court for years.
So I broke it, Acharya.
It is because this
throne had to meet its end
along with Dhananand and his ideology.
Magadha will have a new
ideology and a new throne.
A throne that will symbolise
the culture, tradition
and the new ideology of India.
We will all make it together.
Chandragupta,
your words indicate that you already
have an image of the ideology
that will be represented
in Magadha's new throne.
Yes, Acharya.
And I have taken a resolution.
That I will not take
my new throne until Magadha
is opened for the entire India.
That moment will mark the
beginning of the formation of India.
All right.
Stulbhadra, we have to
go all around India and spread
the news that Magadha
will be ready to welcome
the entire nation for the coronation
of Magadha's emperor,
Chandragupta Maurya.
Rise, Emperor Chandragupta.
Your throne awaits you.
This throne derives
it's powers from your memories.
Splendid!
Never before have I
seen a throne so beautiful!
This throne is made of five elements.
The first is the soil
of our great Motherland.
One that will always remind us
that it is our duty
to protect our nation.
The second element
is the iron shackles..
Ones that had made me
a slave when I was a kid.
And it will remind
me that in this new era
there will be no anarchy, slavery!
The third element!
My blood.
One that flows within me
as the valour of my parents.
One that will always
keep my ideals alive.
The fourth element.
This ash.
It is the remains of all
those patriots and the brave ones.
It will remind me the value
of this freedom!
And finally the fifth element.
The sacred vermillion.
For not just me but for my successors
as it will remind them
that mother land is
the greatest.
Chandragupta,
it is time for you to be seated
on this very throne
and begin a new era!
An era where a united Bharat rises
under the protection of Maurya clan!
- Hail Emperor Chandragupta!
- Hail!
- Hail Emperor Chandragupta!
- Hail!
- Hail Emperor Chandragupta!
- Hail!
- Hail Emperor Chandragupta!
- Hail!
- Hail Emperor Chandragupta!
- Hail!
- Hail Emperor Chandragupta!
- Hail!
- Hail Emperor Chandragupta!
- Hail!
'You have insulted this lock of mine.'
'I swear upon this lock'
'that I will end your line,
Dhananand!'
'I will cleave you
away from this very throne'
'and I will put a
capable ruler over here!'
The very concept of a King
is brought forth from the land.
When the soil comes together
and take a form we get a brick.
And then such countless
bricks assist in making a palace
and giving a form to its existence.
And hence a king
can only rule a great kingdom
when he is connected to his people.
If a king forgets about his subjects
once seated atop his throne
then his ruin is inevitable.
And if the people
do not support their king
then they are paving
a path for their own doom.
So a reign of peace and prosperity
is possible when the king
and the people work together
for the well-being of mankind.
My ethics..
Your destiny.

Amatya, how did this happen?
Dhananand.
He did all this to me, Chandragupta.
This is the reward I got from him
for my honesty and devotion.
He couldn't take revenge
from you for his failure.
But he rained
all the fire of anger on me.
Chandragupta,
I have committed a huge mistake.
I should have chosen you
when you gave me the opportunity.
I have a request for you.
Please make me a part of your shelter.
I want to take my last
breath in my birth place.
Please make me a part of your shelter.
Nothing will happen to you, Amatya.
Stul, inform the royal doctor.
Hurry up.
Chandragupta think
before you do something.
Maybe, it's a trick.
Master!
What's there to think?
Few moments ago I took an oath
for being the ruler of this state.
It's my responsibility, to protect
the person who comes to my shelter.
Master, we need to save Amatya.
We need to give him shelter.
Thank you so much.
Indeed, you are a great king.
'My majesty'
'I have dedicated
my whole life to you.'
'Where's the fault
in my honesty and devotion'
'for which you have
punished me so hard.'
'You are Amatya Rakshas
for the whole world.'
'But for me'
'you are The Great Amatya.'
'Don't worry.'
'You will not die.'
'Amatya, the hive I have given to you
are not enough to die.'
'But they are enough to make
that Chandragupta understand'
'that I tried to kill you.'
'Now you will return back to Magadh.'
'You will enter my palace
and kill Chandragupta.'
'Now you have to kill
Chandragupta for me.'
'And I will take away
everything from him'
'which he has taken away from me.'
My old room.
It's just like it was before.
Yes, Durdhara.
This is the same room of Magadh
from where we started our journey.
You were imprisoned
in your own house for me.
Because, you were with me
not your family.
Now that I am the emperor of Magadh.
I thought, I should fulfil
all the desires of my queen.
I mean everything for the
happiness of the queen of Magadh.
Look there, Durdhara.
Your favourite paintbrushes
made of peacock feathers.
Chandra, I know
you want to give me
all the joy in the world.
But after getting you in my life
I understood,
that the most valuable thing
in life is the love and
support from our beloved.
Not the luxuries.
You want me to start
painting again, right?
Yes.
So until my painting is finished,
you will not open your eyes.
Okay?
It is a cradle, Durdhara.
That means..
Yes, Chandra.
An heir to the Maurya dynasty
will come soon to our life.
Durdhara, you will see. I will give my
child all the happiness in this world.
Our child will never
encounter any pain or grief.
'Listen!
Look at this blood on my palm!'
'This is the blood of
baby-to-be of me and Tara!'
'I will not show
any mercy on anyone now'
'no matter whether he is my enemy'
'or a traitor standing with you.'
Even I hope that our
child never faces any trouble.
Your plan is successful,
Your Highness.
Amatya has entered
Chandragupta's palace.
What did you say?
Chandragupta's palace!
I represent Magadh
and that idiot can
never change this reality.
Next time,
if you say anything like this
that Chandragupta has
rights on any of my belongings
then the weapon which
missed the target now
will hit exactly the target next time.
Forgive me!
The doors of the palace will
soon be opened for their actual king.
Because tonight will be
Chandragupta's last night.
My teacher Chanakya taught
me during childhood itself
that a king should be alert
and prepared even in sleep.
What did you think that
it would be easy to enter
the room of Chandragupta Maurya.
Amatya!
those bodyguards left the palace
on our orders.
'None of Dhananand's belongings
should remain in the palace!'
'Take them out soon!'
'How dare Chandragupta'
'to claim his right
on His Highness' room!'
'And you both.'
'You both are responsible
for His Highness' safety.'
'So, keep watching.'
'What kind of sound it was?'
Those who come to seek
asylum do not raise weapons.
I will give my life for my pride
and honour, Magadh.
I promised the emperor, Dhananand
that I will kill that person
who has ruined his happiness.
And you are that person, Chandragupta.
I will kill you.
Chandra, do not need
to show him mercy.
Acharya always says that
one should get punished for his sin.
Even he should be punished
severely for his deceit.
Being an ex-minister of Magadh
you know very well
what punishment one can get
for trying to kill an emperor.
I hope you are ready
for your punishment.
Amatya Rakshas will bring the good
news of the end of Chandra very soon.
And the flag of
Magadh will be hoisted
on the top of my palace again.
The soldiers of Chandragupta
have brought Amatya Rakshas here.
This means he has failed in his task.
'Rest be assured.
You will not get death penalty.'
'Your punishment is that you
will go to your master, Dhananand'
'and narrate him the
tale of your failure.'
'You will see him leading
a life of a pauper.'
'And that will be your punishment.'
'Dhananand will hold you responsible'
'for his defeat
and insult you every day.'
'That will be your punishment.'
'And I hope that you
will realise sooner or later'
'that the one whom you
have served throughout your life'
'does not deserve your loyalty.'
This means,
the one whom I asked you to kill
has blackened our faces again
by showing you mercy.
You should have killed me,
Your Highness.
No, Amatya Rakshas.
I cannot accept my defeat like this.
The son of a barber cannot
lose to a Kshatriya again.
I will not let Chandragupta
rule over Magadh.
I have not played my last card yet.
Which are you referring to,
Your Highness?
Dhananand will approach Seleucus now.
Dhananand will definitely
go to him to ask for help.
And he will keep trying to kill you
until he defeats you in a battle,
Chandragupta.
This means,
Chandra is not safe even here!
No.
Hence, we need to
tighten his security.
What is your plan, Acharya?
Henceforth,
Chandragupta will not sleep
in a particular chamber
for more than one night.
And no one else will know
about his location except four of us.
If an enemy breaches
the security and enters the palace
he will not be sure which
chamber he should attack.
Durdhara, I know why you are worried.
But don't worry.
Till I'm alive I'll not let
anything happen to you and your child.
Come. Let me drop you to your room.
Seleucus According to the
friendship the deal that we had..
Deal?
What deal?
And what friendship?
Magadh's strong, powerful
King Dhananand that I befriended.
He is king only for you.
For the rest of the world
he is just a common man.
You're forgetting, Seleucus.
That the same person
who built the Magadh empire
only through his power and brain.
And I can do that now.
Your commanders are trying since
months to find a way to get into India
but from Chandragupta army
your army is getting defeated.
And they are destroying
your army from India.
You give your army to me and I
will give you my plan.
After that you will
be able to enter India
because that Chandragupta's
security system will break.
Acharya Your crest reminds me
your pledge is still incomplete.
And it will be incomplete
till Dhananand is alive.
Acharya, you shouldn't
have stopped me from killing him.
It would have been
better for all of us.
My pledge will be fulfilled,
Chandragupta.
With Dhananand death
Nand dynasty will be over.
But killing Dhananand
I had an important agenda
What agenda, Acharya?
One tested enemy from an
unknown friend is more powerful.
Dhananand and Seleucus friendship
will prove to be the same
familiar enemy for us.
The reason why I stopped
you from killing Dhananand
is because I knew
after getting overthrown by us
Dhananand will directly
go to Seleucus for help.
Till now we are aware
of Dhananand's step.
I know everything
in what state what will he do.
Tomorrow when Dhananand and
Seleucus armies will attack us.
Then we will take
advantage of it earth's
mother earth's two enemies
will end them together.
Anyway it is not easy to
face such a big army, Chandragupta.
Specially when we don't know
anything about their strategy.
I understood, Acharya.
Now we have to only be patient.
And see how will Dhananand
and Seleucus's friendship turn out.
Raindrops when they
drop on earth from the sky.
They mix up with the soil
and spreads the fragrance everywhere.
But
when these rain drops come together
because of heavy rain..
Then it can bring flood as well.
Similarly in life
if we don't value a person's nobility
and generosity.
Then that person can get a change
in our life like those rain drops.
The same person can
be the cause of our trouble.
My ethics..
Your destiny.
I do not need a defeated
king to gain victory over India.
I will win your nation
on my own terms, Dhananand.
And I will make that
Chandragupta my slave.

================================================================================

Episode: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAOI4m-fYls

Give me your army and
I will give you my strategy
so that you can again
be able to enter into India
because then Chandragupta's
security will be breached.
Look at this expensive liquor,
Dhananand.
If it's left exposed for a while,
it loses both
its fragrance and its specialty
and becomes an ordinary
useless liquor from
an expensive liquor.
You are somewhat like this right now.
The bravery and intelligence
you speak of is a thing of past
and it has been washed
away by the passage of time.
I could even say that it has vanished.
Dhananand,
if you actually had a proper strategy
Chandragupta would not
have been able to defeat
you on your own soil.
I do not need a defeated
king to gain victory over India.
I will win your nation
on my own terms, Dhananand.
And I will make that
Chandragupta my slave.
My friend, Seleucus, you will change
your opinion soon
and you will give
me your army yourself.
Amatya, is our other strategy
in the right direction?
Our assassins are
following him closely.
They can kill him at any moment,
Your Majesty.
'Promise me, Chandra.'
'That you will not
stop at being an emperor.'
'That you will lay
the foundation for India.'
'That you will put all
your efforts for the honour'
'and prosperity of our nation.'
'That you will prioritise
the motherland'
'so that the future generations
do not follow Dhananand's path.'
'Promise me, Chandra..'
'I promise, Mother.'
'As long as I have your blood in me'
'I will fulfill my every duty'
'towards my motherland
with complete devotion.'
'In the Mauryan dynasty,
I will form an empire'
'where our motherland
will be liberated.'
'from all the torment.'
'It is a promise of your son.'
Mother!
Father!
today we are not here only
to get blessings for our unborn child.
Instead, we want the past
present and future of Mauryan dynasty
to be connected here.
Mother-in-law,
these tiny seeds of banyan tree
are important for Chandra,
Stulbhadra and I.
It is because we know
that they are not only
your blessings for Chandra
but also your dream for
Mauryan dynasty and India.
'Chandra's life has to
be life this banyan tree.'
'To spread the branches
and spread the wave'
'of independence to entire India.'
'To make India united.'
That is why, Mother
we will plant the
seeds of banyan tree near
your and father's tombs.
As the roots of the tree grow up
and take everyone under their shade
your son and the future generations
of Mauryan dynasty
will tie the unity of India
to themselves and protect it.
And we will have a period of rule
of which both you and the motherland
will be proud.
Brother must have sent them here.
Stulbhadra,
take Durdhara to the palace!
I will take care of them.
Come, Soldiers!
Soldiers, stop that chariot!
Stulbhadra,
the attackers are following us.
Dhananand must have
sent them to kill us.
Brother does not want to kill me
but to imprison me again.
But I will not allow it to happen.
Your Highness,
the Queen's chariot has been attacked.
Quickly inform Achrya,
to send the soldiers here.
Make it fast, Stul!
I cannot hold the enemies
back for too long!
Durdhara, you just go
to the palace in the chariot!
No, Stul.
I cannot leave you alone here.
Durdhara,
they are not going to stop so easily!
You just go to the palace
and bring the soldiers!
Till then, I will stop them here!
Durdhara, think about your baby! Go!
Victory to India!
'I hope that sire will
soon come with the soldiers.'
Durdhara, are you all right?
I am fine, but Stul..
We have to go and save him soon.
I am going there.
You just go inside the palace.
No. I request you,
please allow me to join you.
No, Durdhara!
Your life will be in danger there.
I want to see Stul
safe with my own eyes.
And now, we have enough soldiers too.
Okay. Come fast.
Stul..
Durdhara, you will not
go anywhere until the it is safe.
Hold this.
Look there! You all will die soon!
None of you will be spared now!
'The braid that you
have insulted today'
'I take an oath in
the name of the same braid'
'that I will destroy
your Nand dynasty, Dhananand!'
'I will throw you out of this throne'
'and will give it to a worthy king.'
'Your greed for power and strength'
'has taken away everything
from your life, Dhananand.'
'But you have still not changed.'
'One day,
this greed will kill you too.'
'I, Chandragupta Maurya'
'announce this in front
of all the people of Magadh'
'that the former king of Magadh'
'Dhananand is ousted from Magadh!'
'I spared Dhananand's
life in this condition'
'that he will never come
back to Magadh from today onwards.'
'Macedonian King
Seleucus does not need'
'a defeated king to win India.'
'I will win your state
in my own conditions.'
'Chandragupta,
I lost everything because of you'
'and Dhananand had to bow before
Seleucus today because of you.'
'But I will take revenge'
'for my insult from Seleucus.'
'I will make him bow before
me by finding his weakness.'
The snow leopard that
I've been chasing from so long
in the valley of Hindu
Kush was this close to me today!
How can it disappear all of a sudden!
Go! Go and announce
that whoever hunts the
snow leopard will receive
One lakh gold coins
from my side as a reward.
Go!
You can give me that reward.
Helena?
Helena, you are the
only one in this world
that has the might to
defeat the King of Macedonia.
Splendid!
What a majestic beast!
Right?
I want my reward first!
My dear
I can give you my empire
so why seek a few thousand coins?
Bring her whatever she wants
as she has accomplished such a task!
Are you happy now?
'Move, you fatso! Move!'
'What now?'
'What else?'
'I had told you that
you will get a kick!'
'This robe is a bit smaller.'
'No, it is your belly
that is enormous.'
'I gives you my word as your brother'
'that I will protect
you to my last breath.'
'Every threat that comes to you'
'must face me first!'
'Many allies fall
as one reaches the top.'
'Such was the fate of Chandragupta.'
'Dhananand's greed for power'
'and desire to reach his throne'
'caused Chandragupta
to lose his people'
'even after he had become
the Emperor of Magadh.'
Have you seen a
fisherman gather his net
after he has caught the fishes?
Even if the fisherman
sees a bigger fish at that time
he does not throw
his net back in the water
since he knows that
if he goes for the bigger fish
he might lose the ones
that he has already caught.
And finally he will have an empty net.
And hence in life, if we seek the
uncertain while leaving what we have
then we will lose what is not ours
and we might also
lose what we have earned
by hard work and efforts.
Always remember.
It is foolish to drop
the silver you got today
for the gold that
you might get tomorrow.
My ethics..
Your destiny.
I will win Magadh back again tomorrow.
And for that,
you will give me your whole army.
Otherwise,
you will find your dear daughter
lying dead at your feet.

Episode: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXv0bF9tGVg

You know, Rakshas
it has been eight months
three days and an afternoon
since Chandragupta banished
me from my own kingdom of 'Magadh'.
And throughout this time
there was never a moment
that I stopped contemplating revenge.
I am desperate for that moment
when I get to spill his blood
and quench my thirst of revenge.
Are you even listening
to what I am saying, Rakshas?
Yes, my king.
I heard every word you said.
What I was thinking
is, why do we not put an end
to Chandragupta on this day itself?
What is your plan?
What is brilliant about this plan
is that I do not
have anything planned.
It is Chandragupta who will serve us
an opportunity on a sliver plate.
Maids. Set the food over here.
What is this? I told you
that I wish to eat alongside the
children we invited for the banquet.
Forgive me, my king.
I may have misunderstood.
I was told that you would
be dining in your chambers.
Make sure that this meal
is Chandragupta's last.
Do not worry, my King.
I will personally ensure
that the devastation Chandragupta
brought you is not even close
to what he would suffer.
And not just him but all those people
who consider him as their God.
Hail our King.
Chanakya has urgently
summoned you to the court.
Wait, here. I will be back soon.
What is going on, Chanakya?
I have cancelled the banquet.
But why?
Take the food away.
And gather all the
children for the banquet.
- All right?
- Yes, my queen.
My queen! Are you all right?
Please sit.
I will inform the king.
No.
Just bring me some water.
Okay, my queen!
Here you go.
You should have something, my queen.
You have not had
anything since morning.
And the banquet will
not start any time soon.
Taste this.
It is poisoned.
Yes.
Once again,
Dhananand tried to kill you.
But neither he, nor anyone
in the world can kill you with poison.
Because,
apart from me, no one knows that
the daily dose of
poison I mix in your food
have increased your body's tolerance
to poison by many fold.
Which means no poison in
this world can ever kill you.
'Maids. Set the food over here.'
What if Durdhara consumes
the food sent to my room?
This tastes odd.
It is not because of the food
but the effects of your pregnancy.
Sometimes your tongue tastes funny.
Maybe
it was just my imagination.
You see, this is my first experience.
Are you all right, my queen?
Let me get you some water.
My queen!
Durdhara.
Chan..
Chandra! Our baby!
Save our baby.
Do not worry.
Nothing will happen to you.
Nothing will happen to you, Durdhara.
Just have patience.
You have to save Durdhara's life.
Acharya, do whatever you want.
But please save Durdhara's life.
Chandragupta.
Go and bring the royal
physician here quickly.
I am taking care of Durdhara.
Chandragupta, do not waste time.
Just do what I say.
Go and bring the royal
physician here quickly.
Acharya, I know
that I will not survive.
I can see my death
clearly in your eyes.
That is the reason you have
sent Chandra away from here, right?
I do not care for me.
But please save my baby.
I am begging you.
Please save my baby.
Durdhara, you are right.
Saving your life..
But there is only one way
to save this baby if
if I cut your stomach open
and get the baby out.
Chandra and my baby
will not die inside my womb
because of my brother.
Do whatever you want
in order to save my baby's life.
Hold her hands.
'The heir of Maurya clan is
going to come in our lives very soon.'
'I will give my baby all
the happiness of this world.'
'No hardship or misery
will be able to touch our baby.'
Chandra!
Durdhara.
Chandra,
I asked Acharya to save our baby,
not me.
The heir of Maurya
clan is hale and hearty.
Only one drop of poison touched him.
How could I let my brother
kill our baby, Chandra?
The heir of Maurya clan, our future..
How could I let him get killed?
He is the one who
needs to take forward
the legacy of his
father and Maurya clan.
Acharya
you have saved our baby's life.
Please give him a name.
The one who has been
born with a drop of poison..
That child of the Maurya dynasty
will be the heir with the
help of that powerful poison.
His name will be..
Bindusara.
Bindusara!
Accept my gratitude, Chandragupta..
For giving a proud queen of Magadh
an opportunity to
be the queen of Mauryas
your wife and a mother.
I..
I pray to God
that in every new birth of mine
I should stand by you.
Durdhara.
'My only star in the sky..
My pampered and darling sister..'
'I welcome you.'
'You're amazing, my darling sister.'
'You brought an astounding
and magnificent horse'
'who is like a storm, for me.'
Once again,
that imbecile has pained me.
First, it was Tara..
Then, my unborn child..
'I had your child in my womb.'
And now..
Now, he snatched my
sister who was close to me!
The poison which was
meant for that imbecile
my sister consumed it.
More trouble is brewing
while we try to wipe
out the Mauryan dynasty.
Not only that imbecile
but his successor has also been born.
You are right, Your Highness.
We have to change our strategy.
We need to focus on another king
rather than the previous one,
Your Highness.
You are right, Mahamatya.
We need to shift our
focus from Chandragupta
to Seleucus.
So that, to make me
rule the entire Magadh
and to kill Chandragupta
he gives us the support of his army.
And for that, we need to
find the weak feature of Seleucus.
We need to take advantage of that
and make him so helpless
that he has no other options
but to help us.
But..
But what can be his weak point?
'The truth is that
I have so much wealth'
'that I can get any woman on earth..'
'Even your darling daughter, Helena.'
'Dhananand!'
The daughter of Seleucus.. Helena.
She is his weakness
and our key
to getting his army from Macedonia.
With which we can
win Magadh back again
and end that Chandragupta.
'And with that started
the last chapter'
'between Chandragupta and Dhananand.'
'The seed Chandragupta
sowed had taken roots'
'and with that, the Maurya dynasty's
rule started getting strengthened.'
'Small kingdoms around
Magadh started merging with it.'
'But the future was
waiting for Chandragupta'
'with the biggest
challenge of his life.'
'Because his two biggest enemies'
'Seleucus and Dhananand,
were about to become allies.'
Friend Seleucus, amazing!
I heard that for years
you wanted to hunt a snow leopard.
What are you doing here?
Like you, I have also been
trying to kill a prey for years.
And that prey is Chandragupta.
So I thought you might
have changed your mind by now
and you might give me your whole army
so that I can win
my kingdom back again.
That is why I have come to meet you.
Dhananand,
I made it clear the last time
that I do not need you
to conquer your kingdom.
Then why did you assume
I might have changed my mind?
That dead snow leopard
which your dear daughter Helena
gave you as a gift holds
the answer to your question.
I killed that snow leopard
to give it to your daughter Helena.
And after that she
became my close friend.
So close that she even
accepted my invitation
to have a meal with me.
Your daughter must be
with Mahamatya right now.
And who knows..
He might even have added a few
just a few drops of poison
in your dear daughter's food.
Dhananand!
I will win Magadh
back again tomorrow.
And for that,
you will give me your whole army.
Otherwise
you will find your dear daughter
lying dead at your feet.
Friend Seleucus!
Why are looking at the
moon so intently, Acharya?
A solar eclipse will occur tomorrow,
Chandragupta.
And I am imagining that scene..
I am imagining how this
moon will weaken the sun's glow
and eclipse it.
I understand what you mean, Acharya.
We have united the
different kingdoms of India
and forged a bond between them.
And I will not let Dhananand
or Seleucus break this bond.
I promise you, Acharya
when Dhananand and Seleucus
will advance tomorrow
from the hills of Hindu Kush
to break this bond, I will definitely
put an end to that Dhananand.
Leaves of Neem tree
have many qualities.
Everyone knows how useful
they are for body and health.
But despite being so useful
the leaves of Neem tree
also have one deficiency..
They are bitter.
And because of this
we hesitate to eat them.
But if we were to eat these
Neem leaves with honey
we can very easily take
advantage of their qualities.
Like these Neem leaves
only having qualities and
talent is not enough for a person.
It is also important
for them to be polite
and behave decently.
Only then will this world appreciate
their qualities and talent.
My ethics..
Your destiny.
I, Vishnugupta Chanakya,
declare this today
in front of everyone
the pledge I took years ago..
I consider it to be fulfilled today
and as a result, I will tie my braid.

Episode: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33EPAVLMjVg

The gallant soldiers of India
the time has come
that we strike the
enemies of our motherland.
Today, we need to destroy
these two enemies of our motherland.
Get ready!
Attack!
Attack!
- Attack
- Attack!
Dhananand
you tried to disintegrate
my motherland throughout your life.
But today, you will witness
the strength of India's unity
in this battlefield.
Seleucus Nicator, have the courage
of attacking from the front at least
when you have the dream of
ruling over a country like India.
"He is dedicated to his motherland."
"Chanakya is always alert."
"The one who clears all doubts"
"and invokes the feeling
of patriotism in hearts"
"He is Chanakya.."
"He is Chanakya.."
"He is Chanakya.."
"He is Chanakya.."
"He is Chanakya.."
It seems your beloved, Acharya,
is about to meet everyone
who have already gone
to heaven after their death.
Shrewd Chanakya is the root
cause of my every problem.
This war will end with his death.
"May he always safe and hale
and hearty in the battlefield."
"May he always win in every battle.."
"The one who dedicates
his life to his country"
"and kills every enemy.."
"He is the symbol love and bravery."
"He is brave and daring."
"He is Chanakya.."
"He is Chanakya.."
"He is Chanakya.."
"He is Chanakya.."
"Chandragupta.."
"Chandragupta.."
Your death is around the corner,
Dhananand.
"Chandragupta Maurya.."
"Chandragupta Maurya.."
"Chandragupta Maurya.."
"Chandragupta Maurya.."
"Chandragupta.."
Magadh is immortal.
Magadh is invincible.
No one can kill Magadh.
Your Highness!
Finally
Chandragupta of Maurya clan
has eclipsed the sun
of Magadh clan.
'Dhananand's death forced
Seleucus to surrender.'
'But Chandragupta and Chanakya could
not leave Seleucus alive like this.'
'Hence, Chandragupta signed
a treaty with Seleucus.'
'As per the treaty,
Seleucus returned Chandragupta'
'all the wealth that
he looted from India.'
'And Chandragupta get married
to his daughter, Helena'
'in order to shatter his
dream of ruling over India.'
Chandragupta
after a warrior's enemy
dies in the battlefield
it becomes the duty of that warrior
to perform his enemy's
last rites properly.
But we were his arch-enemies.
So, if one of us lights his pyre
his soul will never rest in peace.
Only that person has
the right to light his pyre
who has considered all of
Dhananand's orders to be his duty.
Here you go.
Your Majesty,
accept my last greetings.
"He is Chanakya.."
"He is Chanakya.."
"He is Chanakya.."
"He is Chanakya.."
'You are proud of your knowledge.'
'Are you not, scholar?'
'You are proud of your braid
that is the symbol of your knowledge.'
'Is it not the braid that
makes people respect you?'
'Today, you will get to know'
'the real place'
'of your braid and you!'
'Many arrogant people like
you wait for me at Magadh's door!'
'They bow down to me
to get their wishes granted!'
'They beg to me!'
'You call yourself a scholar.'
'Do you not know that you
have to bow down for begging?'
'Get up! Get up!'
'I created this hall for ending
your dream of a united India.'
'I did it so that along with you'
'everyone witnesses that I, Dhananand,
am akin to a great and raging river'
'whereas you are
akin to a speck of dirt'
'that can bow down to me'
'but if it dares to cross
my path it will be destroyed!'
Welcome, Acharya Chanakya!
Remember! This was the hall
where you were humiliated years ago.
Today, your disciple will
felicitate you in the same hall.
'Priest Chanakya's thoughts
while sitting in Magadh'
'have started moving
in reverse direction.'
All of you, please take your seats.
I was stupid
that I preferred the
kingdom over the country.
Because of my loyalty and blind trust
I could not see the dream
of united India which you saw.
And if I had chosen the right path
then so many people
would not have got killed.
This bloodshed and this battle
would not occur, Vishnugupta.
I have realised now
that why you chose Chandragupta
Maurya over King Dhananand.
- Please forgive me.
- Amatya.
I forgive you.
We cannot bring revolution
without struggle or battle.
We cannot become independent, Amatya.
What happened in the past,
what was right or what was wrong
is not important.
What is important
is that you have
understood this very well
that why it was important
to take the throne away
from a cruel ruler like Dhananand
and why India needed a new ruler.
Yes. This is important.
Do you remember, Amatya?
Many years ago,
my dream of a united India
was insulted in this gathering.
It was made fun of.
I remember.
And in the same gathering
of Magadh today
all 16 parts of India are together.
United and strong.
All this became possible
because of the same dream
which I saw years ago.
The dream which is..
Fulfilled by
my dearest student
His Highness Chandragupta Maurya.
That is why today..
I, Vishnugupta Chanakya,
declare this today
in front of everyone
in front of my dearest student
and with a lot of happiness that
the pledge I took years ago..
'I, Priest Vishnugupta Chanakya,
take an oath'
'in the name of the same braid'
'which you have insulted today'
'that I will destroy
your Nand dynasty, Dhananand!'
'I will throw you out of this throne'
'and will bring a
worthy ruler on it..'
'I will'
'not tie my braid'
'until'
'I fulfill my oath.'
I consider it to be fulfilled today
and as a result, I will tie my braid.
- Hail Priest Chanakya!
- Hail..
- Hail His Highness Chandragupta!
- Hail..
- Hail Priest Chanakya!
- Hail..
- Hail His Highness Chandragupta!
- Hail..
- Hail Priest Chanakya!
- Hail..
Chandragupta, in order to
handle the workload of the state
even Amatya Rakshas is with you now.
So, I will have enough time
to fulfill the second
promise that I made to you.
Yes, you may forget,
but I still remember.
I have to teach
Economics to the world.
'Please promise me that as
soon as your oath will be fulfilled'
'and we will oust
Dhananand from the throne'
'then you will share
the knowledge of Economics'
'with the world.'
'That day, Economics'
'will spread the light of knowledge.'
'Promise me.'
'I, Vishnugupta Chanakya,
make this promise'
'on the occasion of 'Guru
Purnima' that when you will become'
'the king of united India,
then I will give this knowledge'
'of Economics away
to the entire world.'
There is a speciality
of the Indian sandalwood.
If it is packed in
a cloth for some time
then even after removing
it from the cloth
the fragrance of Indian sandalwood
remains in that cloth for many days.
Even our actions should
be like Indian sandalwood
which can keep us alive
in people's thoughts
even after we leave the world.
Remember
if there is excellence
in our behaviour
and if we stay sincere towards
our actions and the country
then every citizen
of this country can become
Chandragupta Maurya.
My ethics..
Your destiny.
